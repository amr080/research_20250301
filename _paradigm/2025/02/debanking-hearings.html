For example, Stellar Development Foundation’s CEO reported that the Foundation was debanked, after which they approached ten different financial institutions to gain sufficient coverage. <a id="fn-ref-1" class="text-green font-mono align-super text-mono-12" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-1">1</a>  That demeaning shuffle has been a too-common occurrence over the last few years in crypto.</p><p></p><p>Without a bank account, it is presently difficult to interact with traditional financial systems or receive institutional financing. The problem is compounded if payment processors also refuse the company’s business, jeopardizing on- and off-ramps. Being debanked is not a one-time embarrassing event, but exposes a company to a dangerous cascade of risks that can capsize even a well-managed firm. Not everyone has stayed afloat after all those waves.</p><p></p><p>Banks justified the debanking of crypto companies with generalized arguments that such companies present legal or financial risk. However, providing basic financial services to crypto companies is not the same as taking crypto assets as deposits or even lending to such companies. And while risk management can be a legitimate consideration, we are concerned that banks were looking for a pretext to avoid regulatory scrutiny rather than genuinely mitigate risk, especially when even rigorously-vetted companies were losing bank accounts.</p></div></div><div class="relative hidden xl:block row-start-1 max-w-[250px] pl-1" style="opacity:1"><div class="flex flex-col gap-3 min-w-[250px]"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 font-mono text-mono-12 break-words"><h3 class="font-medium">1</h3><div class="rich-text line-break rich-text-post rich-text-inline"><p>See <a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/WgjUM8U81FY?feature=shared&amp;t=4705">testimony</a> by Denelle Dixon, Stellar Development Foundation’s CEO, before the House in December 2024</p><span>. </span><a class="inline-block" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-ref-1">↩</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="my-2 md:my-4"><div class="grid grid-cols-12"><div class="col-span-12 md:col-start-2 md:col-span-9 xl:col-span-8 xl:col-start-4 flex flex-row gap-10 max-w-[1250px]"><div class="rich-text line-break rich-text-post text-serif-16 md:text-serif-18 leading-28"><div><h3 id="4eaaca248c99"><strong>Issue 2: Crypto Founders Personally Lost Access to Banking</strong></h3><p>Crypto founders and employees have also been debanked. <a id="fn-ref-2" class="text-green font-mono align-super text-mono-12" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-2">2</a>   For example, Hayden Adams <a class="" href="https://x.com/haydenzadams/status/1485294362657443842">reported</a> that JPMorgan Chase debanked him in 2022 without explanation.

This “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” echoes a 2014-era effort by federal banking regulators (known as “Operation Chokepoint”) to cut off banking services to various legal industries that the government disfavored, including payday lenders and firearms manufacturers.</p><p></p><p>Recent FOIA requests revealed that the <a class="" href="https://www.fdic.gov/foia/history-associates-inc-v-fdic-fdics-redacted-pause-letters-january-3-2025">FDIC sent letters to 25 banks</a> in 2022 advising them to pause crypto-related activities until the agency could assess risks. Later, in January 2023, the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve issued a <a class="" href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2023/fil23001.html">joint statement</a> to banks that business models with concentrated exposure to the crypto-asset sector posed “significant safety and soundness concerns.” This statement was <a class="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240328231647/https://www.whitehouse.gov/nec/briefing-room/2023/01/27/the-administrations-roadmap-to-mitigate-cryptocurrencies-risks/">endorsed</a> by the Biden White House, which encouraged federal regulators to “limit financial institutions’ exposure to the risks of digital assets.”</p><p></p><p>The implied threat of increased regulatory scrutiny, additional examinations, or potential enforcement actions was enough to deter many banks from servicing the entire industry.

Indeed, both are examples of situations where regulators let their politics get ahead of smart oversight.</p><p></p><p>In March 2023, Silvergate filed for voluntary liquidation and, shortly thereafter, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) forcibly closed Signature. Silvergate initially expressed liquidity concerns in late 2022, after experiencing a large outflow of customer deposits following the bankruptcy of FTX, but successfully averted collapse after securing loans from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of San Francisco.</p><p></p><p>However, in the subsequent months, Silvergate’s ability to conduct business and secure further loans was complicated by intense government scrutiny. On March 1, 2023, Silvergate <a class="" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000110465923027353/tm238251d1_nt10k.htm">disclosed risk</a> of potential adverse financial performance due to, among other things, (i) “the safety and soundness concerns expressed by the federal banking agencies regarding banking institutions with business models that are concentrated in digital asset related activities,&quot; <a id="fn-ref-4" class="text-green font-mono align-super text-mono-12" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-4">4</a> (ii) congressional inquiries, <a id="fn-ref-5" class="text-green font-mono align-super text-mono-12" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-5">5</a>      and (iii) investigations by the Department of Justice.

The resulting crisis of confidence in Silvergate by depositors and lenders led to its filing for voluntary liquidation later that month.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Silvergate collapsed, NYDFS closed Signature Bank over insolvency concerns due to outflows of customer funds from the bank. Executives at Signature were <a class="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/business/janet-yellen-silicon-valley-bank.html">surprised</a> by NYDFS’s closure given their belief that the bank was solvent and well capitalized.</p><p></p><p>The immediate causes of these banks’ failures were not any unique risk of the crypto industry, <a id="fn-ref-6" class="text-green font-mono align-super text-mono-12" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-6">6</a>   but instead a simultaneous outflow of customer deposits and an apparent inability to secure emergency financing (both due to their heavy concentration of customers in a single industry and government pressure). <a id="fn-ref-7" class="text-green font-mono align-super text-mono-12" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-7">7</a>   It is incorrect to suggest that siloing the crypto industry into a small number of banks decreased systemic risk; rather, the resulting concentration <em>increased</em> systemic risk.</p><h3 id="d9e44c4a80ec"><strong>Issue 5: SAB 121 and SAB 122</strong></h3><p>Although not directly related to debanking, the hearings (and surrounding media coverage) are likely to mention <a class="" href="https://www.sec.gov/regulation/staff-interpretations/accounting-bulletins/old/staff-accounting-bulletin-121">SAB 121</a>, an accounting rule the SEC introduced in 2022 that made it prohibitively expensive for banks to custody crypto assets.</p><p></p><p>Under this rule, financial institutions were required to treat crypto assets (including those they custodied) as liabilities on their balance sheets, necessitating offsetting capital reserves (lest bank capital holding requirements be negatively impacted). SAB 121 did not solely target crypto asset deposits at banks (where, similar to any dollar bank deposit, a bank will lend the deposit), but instead targeted assets under custody (where a bank would, similar to a custodian like Coinbase, custody the private keys to a user’s hosted wallet). Custodying crypto is like storing gold in a bank vault for safekeeping: the bank will maintain some insurance to offset risk of loss, but it is not lending the asset itself. SAB 121 made the business of crypto custody prohibitively expensive, substantially shrinking the number of custody options available to the market. <a id="fn-ref-8" class="text-green font-mono align-super text-mono-12" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-8">8</a></p><p></p><p>SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce <a class="" href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-wharton-fintech-110124#_ftnref31">noted</a> that SAB 121 was just one of many examples of the SEC providing a “supervisory signal” to dissuade traditional financial firms from servicing crypto clients. Underscoring the arbitrary nature of this guidance, Jim Kroeker, the former Vice Chair of the Federal Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the SEC’s Chief Accountant from 2009 to 2012, recently stated that SAB 121 was not consistent with existing GAAP standards, and was clearly “<a class="" href="https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1885371843667783855">punitive</a>” in intent.</p><p></p><p>SAB 121 was <a class="" href="https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/staff-accounting-bulletins/staff-accounting-bulletin-122">rescinded</a> by the SEC on January 23, 2025, concurrent with President Trump’s recent <a class="" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/">executive order</a> on crypto. <a id="fn-ref-9" class="text-green font-mono align-super text-mono-12" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-9">9</a></p></div></div><div class="relative hidden xl:block row-start-1 max-w-[250px] pl-1" style="opacity:1"><div class="flex flex-col gap-3 min-w-[250px]"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 font-mono text-mono-12 break-words"><h3 class="font-medium">4</h3><div class="rich-text line-break rich-text-post rich-text-inline"><p>Although this language can be understood generally in the context of regulatory disfavor towards crypto, the timing and wording of the statement clearly allude to the January 2023 joint statement by the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve referred to above</p><span>. </span><a class="inline-block" href="debanking-hearings.html#fn-ref-4">↩</a></div></div><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 font-mono text-mono-12 break-words"><h3 class="font-medium">5</h3><div class="rich-text line-break rich-text-post rich-text-inline"><p>In December 2022 and January 2023, Elizabeth Warren and other senators sent several letters to Silvergate and regulators regarding the company’s connections to FTX, financial solvency, and servicing of crypto clients.
