Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), we also have to provide you with the categories of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect and disclose for business or commercial purposes. As used in this section, “personal information,” “sensitive personal information,” “business purposes,” “commercial purposes,” and “categories” shall have the meanings set forth by the CCPA.</p><p>In the twelve months leading up to the effective date of this Policy, we have collected and disclosed the categories of personal information described in the section above on “<a class="" href="privacy-policy.html#cb7fd72a70c2">Personal Information We Collect</a>” for business or commercial purposes.

This Section only applies to you if you are a California resident. It applies to personal Information that we collect on or through the Services and through other means (such as information collected offline and over the telephone). It does not apply to personal information we collect from our employees and job applicants in their capacity as employees and job applicants.</p><h4 id="d46053c6cddd">CCPA Rights</h4><p>If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we:</p><ul><li>Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, “selling,” or “sharing” your personal information; the categories of third parties to whom we disclose or “sell,” or with whom we “share,” personal information; and the categories of personal information we “sell” or “share.”</li><li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we maintain about you.</li><li>Delete certain information we maintain about you.</li><li>Correct inaccurate personal information we maintain about you.</li></ul><p>The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.</p><p>You also have the right to opt out of “sales” and “sharing” of personal information. We have not “sold” or “shared” your personal information in the 12 months preceding the effective date of this Policy. As our Services are not directed to minors, we do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of children under 16.</p><p>You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights.

If we are unable to verify you through this method, we shall have the right, but not the obligation, to request additional information from you.</p><p>If we are unable to verify your identity with the degree of certainty required, we will not be able to honor your request. We will notify you to explain the basis of the denial.</p><h4 id="f3d6d69cadef">Authorized Agents</h4><p>You may designate an agent to submit requests on your behalf.</p><p>If you would like to designate an agent to act on your behalf, you and the agent will need to provide us with a power of attorney or your signed permission indicating the agent has been authorized to submit the opt-out request on your behalf. We may also require that you verify your identity directly with us or confirm with us that you provided the agent with permission to submit the request.</p><h4 id="5a319ce3f389">California Do Not Track</h4><p>Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, our Site does not respond to browsers&#x27; “DNT” signals.</p><h4 id="ff5e93733bec">Retention of Your Personal Information</h4><p>The personal information we do or will collect, including sensitive personal information, will be retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of the collection or for legal obligations as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Those measures include administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information. However, data security incidents and breaches can occur due to a variety of factors that cannot reasonably be prevented; therefore, our safeguards may not always be adequate to prevent all breaches of security.</p><h2 id="23a271c08cde">International Residents</h2><p>Personal Information collected from you, including via our Site, will be transferred to the United States where the Site is hosted. You hereby consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to the United States as described in this Privacy Policy.
