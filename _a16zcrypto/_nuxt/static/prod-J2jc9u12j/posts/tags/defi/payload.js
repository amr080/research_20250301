Tokenization may sound like some kind of mysterious alchemy, but the concept is simple: It means “creating a digital representation of” some physical thing — a stock, bond, commodity, or other asset — in a database, usually a blockchain or distributed ledger. The token serves as a financial record.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EHowever, most of these projects either have launched outside the U.S., or have been forced to limit their operations to cut off the world of digital finance from the rest of the financial ecosystem. U.S. regulators have to date mostly failed to appreciate the many benefits of tokenization, and so have enforced artificial and arbitrary distinctions that effectively disallow it in traditional finance. In the past few years the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has drawn hard and fast lines between tokens and other assets. It has done this even though its own pre-existing regulatory frameworks around financial recordkeeping would otherwise allow it.

As recently as a few years ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required brokers to maintain their electronic records “exclusively in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format” — a permanent record, in other words. Firms were forced to maintain a mirror set of records on obsolete media such as tapes and optical disks for official purposes even as they kept books and records for actual use in modern formats, like cloud storage.

The benefits of such systems — advancing liquidity, reducing counterparty risk and trade failures, and creating efficiencies across markets — make them a compelling choice. Through blockchains, outdated systems could be replaced with technologies that streamline the process of execution and clearing of trades. Arcane and completely unnecessary registered entities such as transfer agents could be cut out entirely. Data reconciliation could occur automatically by connecting the systems of various financial intermediaries. And reporting could be automated by including self-regulatory organizations as observers. Indeed, what better audit trail than an indelible blockchain that shows a record of all transactions? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut U.S. regulators haven’t seen it this way. Through informal guidance and statements (rather than formal rulemaking and legislation), they have severely curtailed the adoption of blockchains and distributed ledger technologies across the financial industry. For example, a joint statement issued by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in 2019 effectively prohibited registered broker-dealers from holding tokenized securities on behalf of customers. Their statement said that it may be impossible for broker-dealers to establish that they have “control” over tokenized securities, making it infeasible to comply with customer protection rules. They cited the risks of fraud and theft as well as information security risks. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis prohibition misses the mark. Financial institutions already all use digital records to evidence possession or control. Paper stock certificates have been obsolete since the paperwork crisis of the 1960s and, since then, various institutions in the chain of custody have represented interests in securities through ledger entries. The concerns about tokenized securities cited by the regulators — potential loss of private keys or misdirected transfers — are technical considerations similar to those associated with the transformation of markets to digital records, and these technical considerations already have many solutions in the marketplace. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe 2019 guidance seems to posit that tokenized securities are different in character from securities whose records are maintained in non-distributed ledgers. No one would think to view these non-distributed records as separate assets from the rights in the shares themselves, or that these records are somehow regulated differently from the shares. Ownership rights in securities can be recorded in written or electronic form, but the ink or computer code does not replace the rights; if a copy of a ledger is made, the owner of an asset listed on the ledger does not suddenly have an entitlement to twice the number of securities that it did before. Just so, it does not appear necessary to regulate the tokenized representation of a security as anything different from the security itself. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIf not for U.S. regulators’ somewhat recent artificial and arbitrary restrictions, existing regulatory frameworks would already allow financial industry participants to use blockchains to record transactions in traditional assets — securities in particular — without thinking of digital tokens as separate from the assets they represent. While the SEC has allowed a narrow subset of broker-dealers to maintain blockchain-based records through guidance issued in 2021, this guidance is extremely narrow, limited to broker-dealers who deal only in digital asset securities. Most large broker-dealers deal in many types of securities and have legacy recordkeeping systems that would need to be transitioned to blockchain-based systems over time. The SEC’s current guidance precludes that from happening. It’s unsurprising therefore that pilot projects relating to blockchain-based securities records have taken place in the UK, the EU and Singapore…but not the United States.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhile the full realization of the initial dream of blockchains in finance may be years off, there is no reason for the industry to subject itself to additional regulatory impairments when the legal infrastructure already exists to support the recording of asset transactions onchain.

Money-transmitting businesses are subject to certain registration and information-reporting provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 5312, and a criminal code provision punishing people for failing to register their business, 18 U.S.C. § 1960.

Take a person swapping digital assets: The person can use the services of a centralized exchange business or DeFi protocols to do so. To use a centralized exchange, the person first transfers their digital assets to the exchange, after which the exchange has custody of and exercises control over those assets. The exchange, in turn, effectuates transactions on behalf of the person at that person’s direction. In other words, the exchange “accepts” and “transmits” a user’s funds on the user’s behalf. The centralized exchange’s control over the person’s funds presents certain risks (e.g., loss and misuse) —and policy responses targeting what it can and cannot do with that control can mitigate those risks. In the event the centralized exchange loses the assets they’re controlling on behalf of the person, the exchange should be on the hook.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIn DeFi, the person can accomplish a similar result but without having to cede control over their assets to a third party. When using a decentralized software protocol to exchange digital assets, a person retains control over their digital assets and never cedes that control. Instead, the person uses a novel kind of software tool — a DeFi exchange protocol — to unilaterally conduct the exchange on their own, at their own direction. And unlike the centralized exchange business, the original developer of a DeFi protocol does not retain control over the protocol or have the ability to control how third-parties use it. Only the users of a DeFi protocol exercise control over their own assets. And while there are risks associated with using a DeFi protocol (e.g., it can be complicated technology with higher instances of user error), there is less risk that a third party will lose user funds because the user never gives up custody in the first place. (The bank going down isn’t a risk to you if you’re holding on to your own assets yourself.)\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EA basic understanding of control — in this case, the ability of a third party to actually move funds belonging to the user — is key here. It’s why a centralized exchange business, like the one described above, is appropriately regulated as a “money transmitting” business while the developers of an immutable, non-custodial smart contract protocol are not. It also highlights the perils of improperly understanding and misattributing control. To identify and mitigate sources of risk, on the one hand, and to properly assign liability when things go wrong, on the other hand, requires either identifying who has the necessary control over a system to mitigate risks or who is most responsible for some action in need of redress.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIndustry and lawmakers must come together in 2025 to ensure the law properly reflects accurate concepts of custody and control and the responsibilities that flow from it — whether that’s in the context of a market structure bill, broker reporting obligations, or in reforming Section 1960.

Budish (Chicago) presents his research on high-frequency trading and the design of financial markets. He begins by introducing empirical facts about high-frequency trading; a theoretical critique of the predominant market design used in finance, the continuous limit order book; and his proposed alternative, frequent batch auctions. Then, using a type of data no researcher or regulator had previously obtained, Eric uncovers new empirical facts about high-frequency trading and the magnitude of the “sniping” problem. Eric also discusses some theory and empirics about how modern stock exchanges make money (data and speed) and how they don&#8217;t (trading fees), and how this affects their incentives to innovate on market design. He finally generalizes the frequent batch auction design to accommodate the trade of arbitrary real-valued portfolios of assets, with trading as a flow over time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe presentation is based on the following papers:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E1.

Ciamac Moallemi (Columbia) starts by reintroducing the idea of “loss-versus-rebalancing” (LVR), which quantifies the loss to arbitrageurs in an idealized, continuous-time setting with no trading fees.

In this case arbitrage profits are simply LVR scaled down by the probability of an arbitrage trade in any given block. Moreover, although LVR was developed assuming no fees and continuous trading, with fees and discrete blocks, LVR is roughly the profit gross of fees of arbing the pool. Introducing fees simply changes how LVR is split and who earns it (arbitrageurs or pool LPs). \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\"\u003EArbitrage MEV scales with the square root of the interblock time, which suggests that faster blockchains are one mechanism to reduce arbitrage MEV.

Ciamac Moallemi (Columbia University) resolves the apparent difference between CFMMs and the dominant mechanism in traditional finance, electronic limit order books. He defines a unifying framework for liquidity provision, and illustrates how CFMMs and limit order books are both mechanisms within this framework. Ciamac then considers the economics of CFMMs from the perspective of liquidity providers (LPs), decomposing the return of an LP into a market risk component and a predictable, increasing adverse selection component called &#8220;loss-versus-rebalancing&#8221; (LVR). LVR is a new running cost that must be offset by trading fee income for liquidity provision to be profitable, providing a useful benchmark to assess CFMM LP investment decisions.

When does the benefit exceed the cost? The benefit side of this comparison is easy to understand: revenue from shared trading fees, plus in some cases additional token rewards. This post summarizes a new way to think about the cost side, which centers around a quantity that we call LVR (&#8220;loss versus rebalancing,&#8221; pronounced &#8220;lever&#8221;). We’ll say more about LVR and its implications for LPs and AMM designers below, but first let’s review how AMMs behave as market prices evolve.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Arbitrage and adverse selection in AMMs\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELiquidity providers in automated market makers suffer losses from \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAdverse_selection\"\u003Eadverse selection\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which is part of the price of doing business as an LP. By virtue of offering to take either side (buy or sell) of a trade at a given price, every LP in an AMM runs the risk of taking the wrong side of a trade by a trader with better or more recent information about a token&#8217;s market price. For example, if the price of ETH on the open market suddenly increases, a speedy arbitrageur may buy ETH from an AMM (at a stale, lower price) and resell it on a centralized exchange like Binance (at the new, higher market price), pocketing a profit. Because there are only two types of participants in an AMM, profit to traders must correspond to losses to LPs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo reason about the cost of liquidity provision, and thereby inform both LP participation decisions and AMM design, let&#8217;s start with the simpler question of assessing the past. Suppose we just finished supplying liquidity to an ETH-USDC AMM. In hindsight, was this a good idea? Suppose we deposited 1 ETH and 1000 USDC into the AMM, and upon withdrawal received 0.5 ETH and 2000 USDC. (In most AMMs, what you get back may differ from what you put in, depending on how the market price of the AMM&#8217;s tokens have moved in the meantime.) Suppose further that it was a really good month for ETH, with the market price jumping from $1000 to $4000 over the course of the month. In this case, the decision to provide liquidity would have doubled your money from a $2000-value portfolio on deposit to a $4000-value one upon withdrawal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis may seem like a great move, but this is sloppy thinking. Providing liquidity to the AMM involved holding some amount of ETH for the month. Given that the price of ETH quadrupled during the month, pretty much \u003Ci\u003Eany\u003C\u002Fi\u003E strategy that involved holding some ETH would look pretty great in hindsight.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sharper and more important question is: how did the specific strategy of AMM liquidity provision compare to all the other ways that you could have &#8220;gone long ETH&#8221;? Equivalently, how does the decision look after setting aside the profits (or loss) resulting purely from the evolution of the price of ETH?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way to bet on an increasing ETH price is to &#8212; wait for it &#8212; buy some ETH and hold it. And in our running example, that strategy would have resulted in an end-of-month portfolio (still 1 ETH and USDC 1000, but now with an ETH price of $4000) worth $5000, a full $1000 more than what was withdrawn from the AMM. This gap of $1000 is an example of what is often referred to as &#8220;impermanent loss&#8221; or &#8220;divergence loss.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]The problem with impermanent loss\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile impermanent loss does at least compare LP profits to what could have been made under a reference strategy, it fails to isolate the adverse selection costs faced by AMM LPs. To see this, let&#8217;s change our running example so that the price of ETH is $1000 at both the beginning and the end of the month. In this case, in most AMMs, you&#8217;ll get back the same mix of tokens as in your initial deposit (holding, in effect), which means that the impermanent loss will be zero. This is true whether the ETH price stayed constant all month or jumped around before returning to $1000.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe independence of impermanent loss on the price trajectory (other than its initial and final values) should strike you as fishy. For example, we&#8217;ve already discussed arbitrage on AMMs, whereby traders profit at the expense of LPs. It would seem, then, that LP costs should be increasing in the number of opportunities for AMM arbitrage. And the frequency of such opportunities is very different if the price stays the same (no arbitrage) versus if it jumps around a lot (lots of arbitrage).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Introducing LVR\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe propose a new way to think about the costs suffered by the LPs of an AMM, which centers around a quantity that we call LVR (&#8220;loss versus rebalancing,&#8221; pronounced &#8220;lever&#8221;). LVR can be interpreted in several different ways (which is generally a good sign for a definition). The one we highlight here is as an alternative to impermanent loss that uses a more appropriate and nuanced reference approach, rebalancing. (Another interpretation of LVR is as the loss to an LP after appropriately hedging its market exposure to the price of ETH. Still another is as the best-case profits that could be made by arbitrageurs.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERebalancing is AMM-specific, so let&#8217;s introduce it in the canonical special case of the constant-product market maker (CPMM) that was made famous by Uniswap (v1 and v2). The special case of a two-token CPMM &#8212; also known as an &#8220;x*y=k&#8221; curve &#8212; maintains reserves of two tokens, say x units of ETH and y units of USDC. The spot price &#8212; the price of an infinitesimal trade &#8212; is defined as y\u002Fx, which has the effect of equalizing the market value of the two reserves. (In this sense, such an AMM effectively carries out a rebalancing strategy.) In practice, this spot price is defined implicitly by allowing only trades that leave that product x*y of the two token quantities invariant.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELVR can be defined on a trade-by-trade basis, so let&#8217;s look at a single trade. Consider a CPMM with 1 ETH and 1000 USDC, and suppose that the market price of ETH jumps suddenly from $1000 to $4000. We expect some arbitrageur to buy 0.5 ETH from the CPMM at an effective per-ETH price of 2000 USDC, thereby keeping x*y constant while moving the spot price to 2000\u002F0.5=4000 USDC\u002FETH (and equalizing the market value of the two reserves at $2000).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere&#8217;s the reference rebalancing, starting from the same initial portfolio of 1 ETH and 1000 USDC: copy the CPMM&#8217;s trade (meaning sell 0.5 ETH, just like the CPMM) but \u003Ci\u003Eexecute it at the current market price of $4000\u003C\u002Fi\u003E (e.g., on Binance). Because this alternative strategy results in a portfolio worth $1000 more than that of the CPMM ($5000 vs. $4000), we say that the LVR of this trade is $1000.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EContinuing the example, suppose the price of ETH suddenly jumps back down to $1000. The CPMM will return (post-arbitrage) right back to its original state of 1 ETH and 1000 USDC, in effect buying back the same 0.5 ETH for the same per-ETH price of 2000 USDC. The rebalancing reference strategy copies the trade (buying 0.5 ETH) but executes it at the market price ($1000). The market value of the rebalancing strategy&#8217;s portfolio is now $1500 more than that of the CPMM ($3500 vs. $2000), with the second trade contributing an additional $500 to the cumulative LVR.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis calculation is intuitively satisfying: unlike impermanent loss, LVR depends on the price trajectory (LVR is 0 if the price stays constant but not if it jumps up and then back down) and accumulates trade-by-trade (as every trade might be on the wrong side, leading to additional adverse selection costs).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]LVR: A general definition\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter seeing the preceding example, the general definition of LVR should not surprise you: given an arbitrary sequence of trades on an arbitrary AMM, the LVR of the sequence is the sum of the losses incurred by executing the trades via the AMM rather than on the open market. Each term of this sum is of the form \u003Ci\u003Ea(p &#8211; q)\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, where \u003Ci\u003Ea\u003C\u002Fi\u003E denotes the quantity of ETH sold in the trade (e.g., in our first and second trades above, 0.5 and -0.5), \u003Ci\u003Ep\u003C\u002Fi\u003E denotes the market price at that time (above, 4000 and 1000), and \u003Ci\u003Eq\u003C\u002Fi\u003E denotes the per-unit price of the AMM trade (above, 2000 and 2000).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA variant of the definition is to rebalance periodically (e.g., hourly or daily) rather than trade-by-trade, in effect batching transactions and copying the net trade of each batch. This variant can simplify the empirical analysis of LVR, and is arguably more natural in the hedging interpretation of LVR mentioned above.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EReasoning about the past &#8230;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELVR isolates the adverse selection costs borne by an LP. Was a decision to provide liquidity a good idea in hindsight? To first order, this question boils down to whether the fees collected exceeded the LVR suffered, and thus is typically easy to answer using publicly available data (e.g., the on-chain record of an AMM&#8217;s trades and historical price data on Binance).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E… and about the future\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo reason about future rather than past LP decisions, we cannot rely directly on data and must adopt some mathematical model of how prices might evolve. (Remember that LVR depends crucially on the price trajectory.) We could use a variety of different models, but perhaps the most natural starting point is the standard \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FBlack%E2%80%93Scholes_model\"\u003EBlack-Scholes model\u003C\u002Fa\u003E from finance, with the price of ETH evolving continuously according to a geometric Brownian motion (with respect to a suitable martingale measure).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you&#8217;re unfamiliar with this model, the key thing to know is that it has essentially only one important parameter, the price volatility σ. If σ=0 the price stays constant, while if σ is large, the price jumps around wildly. If you&#8217;re thinking of returns as a random walk, σ can be loosely interpreted as the typical length of a step.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELVR can be characterized in this model precisely. Because LVR accumulates trade-by-trade, and because this is a continuous-time model with trades happening all the time, LVR accumulates as an integral of the instantaneous LVR. Instantaneous LVR turns out to scale quadratically with σ and the current market price, and linearly with the marginal liquidity of the AMM at that price.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mathematical characterization may sound slightly intimidating, but many of the common AMMs are so simple that LVR is given by an elementary closed-form formula.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, with a CPMM, the instantaneous LVR, when normalized by the CPMM&#8217;s market value, turns out to be exactly σ²\u002F8. Plugging in numbers, if a Uniswap v2 ETH-USDC pool has a daily volatility of 5%, then according to our model LPs lose 3.125 bps to LVR every day (for a roughly 11% loss annually). Will fee revenue compensate for this loss? The answer depends on the trading fees and trading volume. For example, if this AMM charges a fixed 30 bps trading fee, then LPs will break even provided the daily volume is roughly 10.4% of the AMM&#8217;s assets. Had the daily volatility been 10%, the required volume would have been four times as high. (Remember that LVR scales quadratically with σ.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]Implications for AMM designers\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELVR is important not only for potential liquidity providers but also for AMM designers. An AMM can be successful only if it has happy LPs, which means that fee revenues need to scale with LVR.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne implication of our work is that, because LVR depends on volatility and fee revenue on trading volume, AMMs should consider dynamic fees that adjust with volume, volatility, or empirically observed LVR. A second is that AMM designers should investigate methods for minimizing LVR (and hence the LP incentives required), for example by incorporating a high-quality pricing oracle to quote closer-to-market prices. Next-generation AMMs are already exploring these and related ideas, and we can&#8217;t wait to see how it plays out.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor deeper technical analysis and discussion of LVR, please see our original paper, “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Farxiv.org\u002Fabs\u002F2208.06046\"\u003EAutomated Market Making and Loss-Versus-Rebalancing\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.” And \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=q5vyJJb-Uyw&amp;list=PLEGCF-WLh2RK2Cym4ZeEWDOSlmirXWtZO&amp;index=33\"\u003Ehere\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is Tim Roughgarden giving a talk on LVR at \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fsbc-22-science-of-blockchain-conference-field-notes\u002F\"\u003ESBC’22\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fjasonmili.github.io\u002F\"\u003EJason Milionis\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University, where he is advised by Christos Papadimitriou and Tim Roughgarden.

When does the benefit exceed the cost? The benefit side of this comparison is easy to understand: revenue from shared trading fees, plus in some cases additional token rewards. This post summarizes a new way to think about the cost side, which centers around a quantity that we call LVR (&#8220;loss versus rebalancing,&#8221; pronounced &#8220;lever&#8221;). We’ll say more about LVR and its implications for LPs and AMM designers below, but first let’s review how AMMs behave as market prices evolve.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Arbitrage and adverse selection in AMMs\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELiquidity providers in automated market makers suffer losses from \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAdverse_selection\"\u003Eadverse selection\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which is part of the price of doing business as an LP. By virtue of offering to take either side (buy or sell) of a trade at a given price, every LP in an AMM runs the risk of taking the wrong side of a trade by a trader with better or more recent information about a token&#8217;s market price. For example, if the price of ETH on the open market suddenly increases, a speedy arbitrageur may buy ETH from an AMM (at a stale, lower price) and resell it on a centralized exchange like Binance (at the new, higher market price), pocketing a profit. Because there are only two types of participants in an AMM, profit to traders must correspond to losses to LPs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo reason about the cost of liquidity provision, and thereby inform both LP participation decisions and AMM design, let&#8217;s start with the simpler question of assessing the past. Suppose we just finished supplying liquidity to an ETH-USDC AMM. In hindsight, was this a good idea? Suppose we deposited 1 ETH and 1000 USDC into the AMM, and upon withdrawal received 0.5 ETH and 2000 USDC. (In most AMMs, what you get back may differ from what you put in, depending on how the market price of the AMM&#8217;s tokens have moved in the meantime.) Suppose further that it was a really good month for ETH, with the market price jumping from $1000 to $4000 over the course of the month. In this case, the decision to provide liquidity would have doubled your money from a $2000-value portfolio on deposit to a $4000-value one upon withdrawal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis may seem like a great move, but this is sloppy thinking. Providing liquidity to the AMM involved holding some amount of ETH for the month. Given that the price of ETH quadrupled during the month, pretty much \u003Ci\u003Eany\u003C\u002Fi\u003E strategy that involved holding some ETH would look pretty great in hindsight.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sharper and more important question is: how did the specific strategy of AMM liquidity provision compare to all the other ways that you could have &#8220;gone long ETH&#8221;? Equivalently, how does the decision look after setting aside the profits (or loss) resulting purely from the evolution of the price of ETH?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way to bet on an increasing ETH price is to &#8212; wait for it &#8212; buy some ETH and hold it. And in our running example, that strategy would have resulted in an end-of-month portfolio (still 1 ETH and USDC 1000, but now with an ETH price of $4000) worth $5000, a full $1000 more than what was withdrawn from the AMM. This gap of $1000 is an example of what is often referred to as &#8220;impermanent loss&#8221; or &#8220;divergence loss.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]The problem with impermanent loss\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile impermanent loss does at least compare LP profits to what could have been made under a reference strategy, it fails to isolate the adverse selection costs faced by AMM LPs. To see this, let&#8217;s change our running example so that the price of ETH is $1000 at both the beginning and the end of the month. In this case, in most AMMs, you&#8217;ll get back the same mix of tokens as in your initial deposit (holding, in effect), which means that the impermanent loss will be zero. This is true whether the ETH price stayed constant all month or jumped around before returning to $1000.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe independence of impermanent loss on the price trajectory (other than its initial and final values) should strike you as fishy. For example, we&#8217;ve already discussed arbitrage on AMMs, whereby traders profit at the expense of LPs. It would seem, then, that LP costs should be increasing in the number of opportunities for AMM arbitrage. And the frequency of such opportunities is very different if the price stays the same (no arbitrage) versus if it jumps around a lot (lots of arbitrage).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Introducing LVR\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe propose a new way to think about the costs suffered by the LPs of an AMM, which centers around a quantity that we call LVR (&#8220;loss versus rebalancing,&#8221; pronounced &#8220;lever&#8221;). LVR can be interpreted in several different ways (which is generally a good sign for a definition). The one we highlight here is as an alternative to impermanent loss that uses a more appropriate and nuanced reference approach, rebalancing. (Another interpretation of LVR is as the loss to an LP after appropriately hedging its market exposure to the price of ETH. Still another is as the best-case profits that could be made by arbitrageurs.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERebalancing is AMM-specific, so let&#8217;s introduce it in the canonical special case of the constant-product market maker (CPMM) that was made famous by Uniswap (v1 and v2). The special case of a two-token CPMM &#8212; also known as an &#8220;x*y=k&#8221; curve &#8212; maintains reserves of two tokens, say x units of ETH and y units of USDC. The spot price &#8212; the price of an infinitesimal trade &#8212; is defined as y\u002Fx, which has the effect of equalizing the market value of the two reserves. (In this sense, such an AMM effectively carries out a rebalancing strategy.) In practice, this spot price is defined implicitly by allowing only trades that leave that product x*y of the two token quantities invariant.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELVR can be defined on a trade-by-trade basis, so let&#8217;s look at a single trade. Consider a CPMM with 1 ETH and 1000 USDC, and suppose that the market price of ETH jumps suddenly from $1000 to $4000. We expect some arbitrageur to buy 0.5 ETH from the CPMM at an effective per-ETH price of 2000 USDC, thereby keeping x*y constant while moving the spot price to 2000\u002F0.5=4000 USDC\u002FETH (and equalizing the market value of the two reserves at $2000).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere&#8217;s the reference rebalancing, starting from the same initial portfolio of 1 ETH and 1000 USDC: copy the CPMM&#8217;s trade (meaning sell 0.5 ETH, just like the CPMM) but \u003Ci\u003Eexecute it at the current market price of $4000\u003C\u002Fi\u003E (e.g., on Binance). Because this alternative strategy results in a portfolio worth $1000 more than that of the CPMM ($5000 vs. $4000), we say that the LVR of this trade is $1000.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EContinuing the example, suppose the price of ETH suddenly jumps back down to $1000. The CPMM will return (post-arbitrage) right back to its original state of 1 ETH and 1000 USDC, in effect buying back the same 0.5 ETH for the same per-ETH price of 2000 USDC. The rebalancing reference strategy copies the trade (buying 0.5 ETH) but executes it at the market price ($1000). The market value of the rebalancing strategy&#8217;s portfolio is now $1500 more than that of the CPMM ($3500 vs. $2000), with the second trade contributing an additional $500 to the cumulative LVR.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis calculation is intuitively satisfying: unlike impermanent loss, LVR depends on the price trajectory (LVR is 0 if the price stays constant but not if it jumps up and then back down) and accumulates trade-by-trade (as every trade might be on the wrong side, leading to additional adverse selection costs).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]LVR: A general definition\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter seeing the preceding example, the general definition of LVR should not surprise you: given an arbitrary sequence of trades on an arbitrary AMM, the LVR of the sequence is the sum of the losses incurred by executing the trades via the AMM rather than on the open market. Each term of this sum is of the form \u003Ci\u003Ea(p &#8211; q)\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, where \u003Ci\u003Ea\u003C\u002Fi\u003E denotes the quantity of ETH sold in the trade (e.g., in our first and second trades above, 0.5 and -0.5), \u003Ci\u003Ep\u003C\u002Fi\u003E denotes the market price at that time (above, 4000 and 1000), and \u003Ci\u003Eq\u003C\u002Fi\u003E denotes the per-unit price of the AMM trade (above, 2000 and 2000).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA variant of the definition is to rebalance periodically (e.g., hourly or daily) rather than trade-by-trade, in effect batching transactions and copying the net trade of each batch. This variant can simplify the empirical analysis of LVR, and is arguably more natural in the hedging interpretation of LVR mentioned above.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EReasoning about the past &#8230;\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELVR isolates the adverse selection costs borne by an LP. Was a decision to provide liquidity a good idea in hindsight? To first order, this question boils down to whether the fees collected exceeded the LVR suffered, and thus is typically easy to answer using publicly available data (e.g., the on-chain record of an AMM&#8217;s trades and historical price data on Binance).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E… and about the future\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo reason about future rather than past LP decisions, we cannot rely directly on data and must adopt some mathematical model of how prices might evolve. (Remember that LVR depends crucially on the price trajectory.) We could use a variety of different models, but perhaps the most natural starting point is the standard \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FBlack%E2%80%93Scholes_model\"\u003EBlack-Scholes model\u003C\u002Fa\u003E from finance, with the price of ETH evolving continuously according to a geometric Brownian motion (with respect to a suitable martingale measure).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you&#8217;re unfamiliar with this model, the key thing to know is that it has essentially only one important parameter, the price volatility σ. If σ=0 the price stays constant, while if σ is large, the price jumps around wildly. If you&#8217;re thinking of returns as a random walk, σ can be loosely interpreted as the typical length of a step.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELVR can be characterized in this model precisely. Because LVR accumulates trade-by-trade, and because this is a continuous-time model with trades happening all the time, LVR accumulates as an integral of the instantaneous LVR. Instantaneous LVR turns out to scale quadratically with σ and the current market price, and linearly with the marginal liquidity of the AMM at that price.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mathematical characterization may sound slightly intimidating, but many of the common AMMs are so simple that LVR is given by an elementary closed-form formula.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, with a CPMM, the instantaneous LVR, when normalized by the CPMM&#8217;s market value, turns out to be exactly σ²\u002F8. Plugging in numbers, if a Uniswap v2 ETH-USDC pool has a daily volatility of 5%, then according to our model LPs lose 3.125 bps to LVR every day (for a roughly 11% loss annually). Will fee revenue compensate for this loss? The answer depends on the trading fees and trading volume. For example, if this AMM charges a fixed 30 bps trading fee, then LPs will break even provided the daily volume is roughly 10.4% of the AMM&#8217;s assets. Had the daily volatility been 10%, the required volume would have been four times as high. (Remember that LVR scales quadratically with σ.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]Implications for AMM designers\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELVR is important not only for potential liquidity providers but also for AMM designers. An AMM can be successful only if it has happy LPs, which means that fee revenues need to scale with LVR.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne implication of our work is that, because LVR depends on volatility and fee revenue on trading volume, AMMs should consider dynamic fees that adjust with volume, volatility, or empirically observed LVR. A second is that AMM designers should investigate methods for minimizing LVR (and hence the LP incentives required), for example by incorporating a high-quality pricing oracle to quote closer-to-market prices. Next-generation AMMs are already exploring these and related ideas, and we can&#8217;t wait to see how it plays out.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor deeper technical analysis and discussion of LVR, please see our original paper, “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Farxiv.org\u002Fabs\u002F2208.06046\"\u003EAutomated Market Making and Loss-Versus-Rebalancing\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.” And \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=q5vyJJb-Uyw&amp;list=PLEGCF-WLh2RK2Cym4ZeEWDOSlmirXWtZO&amp;index=33\"\u003Ehere\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is Tim Roughgarden giving a talk on LVR at \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fsbc-22-science-of-blockchain-conference-field-notes\u002F\"\u003ESBC’22\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fjasonmili.github.io\u002F\"\u003EJason Milionis\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University, where he is advised by Christos Papadimitriou and Tim Roughgarden.

Most web3 lending protocols only support overcollateralized loans, which lend against existing assets, because it’s much easier to manage that risk at scale.  However, borrowers with collateral tend to be margin traders and crypto holders who don’t want to sell their positions. Nearly everyone else across the globe seeks to borrow money because they don’t have what they need.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes undercollateralized lending so difficult? It boils down to assessing the creditworthiness of a given borrower: in other words, determining whether they are likely to repay the loan. The result is that borrowers who need access to credit the most – namely, those who don’t already have substantial assets to lend against – are unable to benefit from most DeFi lenders. This limitation has especially hindered the adoption of DeFi lending in emerging markets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEnter \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgoldfinch.finance\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGoldfinch\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

It also makes off-chain sources of yield available and composable on DeFi.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe protocol works by extending credit lines to lending businesses, which can then draw down stablecoins from the pool and deploy them on the ground in their local markets. In this way, the protocol provides the utility of crypto — specifically, its global access to capital — while leaving the actual loan origination and servicing to the businesses best equipped to handle it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EInvestors can utilize Goldfinch by depositing crypto into the pool to earn yield.

This model involved continuous distribution of Compound’s native tokens (COMP) to users who provided liquidity to the protocol and took out loans from the protocol. Every user of Compound instantly became a stakeholder, with some of them becoming active contributors and voters. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThese financial incentives were crucial for controlling key parameters such as margin requirements and interest rates.

And as the Compound protocol had billions of dollars of assets and liens that needed governance, the primordial settings for a new type of DAO were set — participants had clear reasons to act in the best interests of a network, with their time, assets, and votes, because the growth and success of the network could benefit them personally.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]Yield farming\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe development of governance token distribution, given to users of a protocol rather than only investors and the development team, created a design space for many new models to occur. First was the creation of various incentivized actions on a protocol — “yield farming.” \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EYield farming occurs when users are rewarded for performing actions like lending, borrowing, staking, or providing other forms of asset liquidity — and the reward comes in the form of a token that represents a piece of ownership of the protocol itself. Recipients can either accumulate that ownership, counting on a rise in the value of the protocol, or they can sell it on the open market, compounding their action and increasing their yield. Imagine if major banks gave you a small share of their stock each time you made a deposit — you’d be more likely to make deposits, which would be good for you and the bank.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ECompound users, for instance, could achieve a form of yield by locking up their capital in the protocol (i.e., using it as collateral to transact in the protocol through borrowing and lending) and earning denominated DAO governance tokens. In this way, Compound was able to use COMP to incentivize growth and create a user base incentivized to vote on and contribute to the protocol, as the promise of yield drew more users. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOnce developers realized that they could attract capital to new DeFi primitives via yield farming, there was a race throughout the summer of 2020 to grow DeFi protocols via DAO governance token distributions.

However, as a DAO grows in terms of users or accumulated cash flows (e.g. Compound), it becomes important for communities to manage their capital much like a company, because corporate governance best practices lend themselves well to DAOs, with the added difficulty of less privacy. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]Risk management\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAs the balance sheet of a DAO is generally made up of risky assets, managing a DAO’s currency exposure to ensure that future operations can be funded becomes increasingly important. A number of DeFi and NFT DAOs have treasuries consisting of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of assets. These assets are meant to be used for funding development and audits, providing insurance should an underlying protocol fail, and for spending on user growth and acquisition. In order to meet these goals, DAOs need to manage treasuries to meet particular metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs), such as, “Can we survive a 95% drawdown in asset prices?” or “Can we still purchase NFTs of high value if we earn X% interest on our holdings?”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EHere’s a recent example of how this looks in practice: Network participants in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Faave.com\u002F\"\u003EAave\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a decentralized money market protocol, last week identified potential vulnerabilities in using xSushi as collateral within the protocol, due to an oracle mispricing issue (which was \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2021-10-27\u002Fdefi-protocol-cream-finance-loses-130-million-in-latest-hack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eexploited\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in CREAM Finance for $130 million\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E).

These DAOs naturally act as art and culture curators, with the DAO governance token utilized for voting on adding or removing assets. However, DeFi DAOs often face this problem as well. While some mechanisms, such as Uniswap, allow for permissionless asset addition — anyone can create a trading pool with a new asset — others that have leverage cannot do the same. In particular, lending protocols like Aave and Compound utilize governance to decide which assets can be added or removed. This is because a number of parameters must be chosen for each asset — margin requirement, interest rate curves, insurance costs — and the decisions are crucial for protocol safety. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ELet’s provide a simple example of what can go wrong. Suppose that we mint a new asset — TarunCoin — where I am the owner of 100% of the TarunCoin supply. Now suppose that I create a lending pool that allows me to borrow against 100% of TarunCoin’s value. If I control the price of TarunCoin to USD (e.g. via a Uniswap pool where I am the only liquidity provider), then I can make TarunCoin’s market capitalization really high (say $100M) and then borrow $100M in USD against TarunCoin. However, when my loan inevitably defaults as there is little to no TarunCoin liquidity, then the lenders who pooled assets together to lend me $100M take the loss.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis example illustrates that asset quality — measured in terms of token distribution, liquidity\u002Fease of price manipulation, and historical volumes — is crucial for DeFi DAOs that utilize leverage. As many such DAOs use their governance token as an implicit or explicit insurance fund to pay back lenders should an adverse event occur, it is crucial for such DAOs to be careful which assets they admit and how the parameters for those assets are chosen. As the space evolves, it is likely that insurance products will help improve and reduce the amount of governance intervention needed for asset curation in DeFi.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Ways to run a DAO\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EA natural follow-up question is: &#8220;How can our community actually do these three tasks?

They were previously students at the École Polytechnique and were then at Stanford pursuing their master’s in computer science. They reached out to us after our lecture hoping to learn more about the newest projects and applications in crypto. Over the following months, we got to know them and were impressed by their vision for a stablecoin that is more capital efficient and better serves the needs of users globally—especially those who would like to transact value denominated in something other than the US dollar.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Angle team designed an elegant, decentralized mechanism for creating stable on-chain assets that are backed by volatile on-chain collateral.

This provides competitive pricing and deep liquidity for traders, as well as opportunities for improved capital efficiency. Second, Angle provides competitive yield to those who provide collateral to the protocol by efficiently allocating resources across multiple yield-generating opportunities (i.e. different kinds of stable assets). And finally, to remain over-collateralized, Angle offers leverage with fine levels of control, which gives traders—who do want exposure to price changes—to take the other side of the bet, and thereby provide stability to the users of the stablecoin.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAngle will start with the Euro, their home currency, and then expand to fiat currencies for areas with strong crypto communities but little fiat representation (e.g., Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, the British Pound, Korean Won).

Technology is at its best when it’s improving the lives of people in tangible, concrete ways. And with new technology like crypto, the strongest approach is often to give users those benefits without requiring them to get too involved in the nuts and bolts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt a16z Crypto, we are constantly on the lookout for paths to get cryptocurrency into the hands of the next billion people. How do we think that will happen? By helping them achieve what they already want to do: spend, save, and make money — and by focusing users on tangible benefits, not on the underlying technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s why we’re excited to announce our investment in Eco.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEco’s mission is to reimagine not only how consumer financial products work — but also to reimagine money itself. Eco is not a bank, checking account, or credit card. Although it has elements of each, it’s better than all of those. It begins as a single wallet that rewards you anytime you save or spend your dollars.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, financial transactions involve numerous players at every level — banks, credit cards, processors, and more — introducing inefficiencies and fees along the way. Without the burden of legacy, misaligned business models, Eco is able to offer rewards that sound almost too good to be true, but aren’t.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs investors, we’re in the business of finding and backing big ideas, and Eco has no shortage of those. The challenge is often finding teams who have the skills to back up that vision and bring it to life.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Eco, we found both.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe’ve gotten to know Andy Bromberg and the rest of the Eco team through their work in the crypto space over the last several years.
