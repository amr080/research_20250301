So the most margin-sensitive businesses &#8212; like the corner stores, the restaurants, the mom-and-pop shops &#8212; are probably going to be the people who are most eager to start accepting stablecoins.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re talking about taking businesses like a coffee shop &#8212; which is running, right now, on a 2% margin &#8212; and doubling it. Really, turning businesses that are hardly profitable today to being moderately profitable. A huge difference.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This was what kind of gave me the aha moment &#8212; is when you talked about… what the small businesses \u003Cem\u003Edon&#8217;t \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eget from credit card companies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo they&#8217;re not only paying these fees, but they&#8217;re not even getting the benefits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESam:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah! What&#8217;s so remarkable about credit cards &lt;chuckles&gt; is that they offered consumers fraud protection. And that was great for bootstrapping things like online sales… But fraud protection does basically nothing when the cashier is handing you a coffee as you give them the money.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re talking about $0.30 cents per transaction, and an additional 2% on top of that. That brings a $1.50 coffee &#8212; almost $0.30 cents of that, you know, a fifth of that &#8212; &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; is going to the payment provider. They didn&#8217;t do anything in that transaction; they don&#8217;t really offer very much value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the 2% margin that you&#8217;re giving up &#8212; is pure profit for the payment providers, and a purely a negative for your local coffee shop. I can&#8217;t wait for them to get that $0.30\u002F $0.35 cents margin back and build their businesses out. It&#8217;s very, very rare that you have the opportunity to add 2% directly to your bottom line.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E There&#8217;s a bit of a cold-start problem here, though, right? Because these customers have to have stablecoins in order to be able to use them to pay these businesses and circumvent the interchange fees… Do you think we&#8217;re going to start seeing businesses almost help promote stablecoins, and onboard people on the stablecoins, in order to reap these benefits – are-are we going to start seeing this kind of turn where businesses actually help the go-to market strategy, for stablecoins.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESam:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s my strong belief. But people have relationships with these in-person retailers, coffee shops, and corner stores: They go there often. So I think we&#8217;re going to see these strong local brands begin to bring people onto stablecoins as part of that initial adoption curve.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What I love about this is when I first started covering crypto over at Fortune, my editors would always be like: When can you buy a *coffee* with Bitcoin? And I was like: No-no-no; no, it&#8217;s not like that, that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s for.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut now it&#8217;s like; actually, that is sort of what (at least this) is for.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESam:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s exactly what it&#8217;s for. And I think they&#8217;re gonna be some of the early adopters to do it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thank you, Sam.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESam:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E See you guys. Thank you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Okay. So okay that was interesting; let&#8217;s go on to the next one &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Maggie, your big idea was a very interesting one because it&#8217;s actually focusing more on distribution, which makes perfect sense given your role is in go-to-market and you&#8217;re the head of the go-to-market team here &#8212; You talk about how crypto is finally getting its own app stores, and discovery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you want to just give us an overview of why that even matters? &#8212; Because when you hear that headline, you&#8217;re like oh that feels so inside baseball &#8212; like, why does crypto even need its own thing; isn&#8217;t it already an insider industry?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWould love you to talk about the context, what you&#8217;re observing; and why you think this is an important big idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaggie:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Absolutely. When I started at a16z about three years ago &#8212; and really for the past couple years –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere have been so many companies within our portfolio that have tried to launch apps on the traditional app stores &#8212; so Apple&#8217;s App Store, Google Play Store &#8212; and they&#8217;ve gotten blocked, or denied, or delayed for various reasons.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think what&#8217;s really frustrating is that if you read Apple&#8217;s guidelines, they&#8217;re confusing; one. They are not complete; so they don&#8217;t necessarily address all the questions an app developer might have. But then, the policy is applied inconsistently depending on who the reviewer is.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so we&#8217;ve had multiple companies where depending on who they get as reviewer; or another app is approved for the same thing that they were denied for… It&#8217;s incredibly inconsistent and it&#8217;s a black box. And much of it comes down to this concept of “IAP” &#8212; having to run any sort of in-app purchase through the app store &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat&#8217;s been great is that over the past several months, we are starting to see some alternatives: One great example is Solana&#8217;s Dapp Store, they&#8217;re actually fee-free. And when the Saga Phone (part 2, the second generation) comes out &#8212; I think they had something like 100,000 pre-orders &#8212; so that will only increase. Another one is the World App &#8212; so WorldCoin (or “World”), they&#8217;ve launched several mini apps &#8212; and all of these mini apps have incredible traction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd not just these, but there’re also are blockchains that are supporting different games &#8212; they&#8217;re running their marketplaces; we have infra marketplaces… &#8212; You&#8217;re starting to see so many of these, and they&#8217;re really starting to hit scale. And I think will become a really viable alternative for those traditional app stores.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s fantastic. One question that comes to mind when I hear this is &#8212; and this might be the meta question that applies to all of crypto, actually &#8212; which is: What if you have too many options?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the nice things about the world we live in with two dominant operating systems on our current mobile phones (between Apple and Android) is: It&#8217;s nice that I only have to go to one place to get something. So, like, are these apps like being listed across multiple app stores… Are they specific? &#8212; like, both WorldCoin and Solana have their own app stores &#8212; And you pointed out in your big idea that it&#8217;s also interesting because those are both companies that also have hardware, not just software: Like, in the case of World, they have the Orb. In the case of Solana, they have the Saga Phone… And that is obviously very similar to how Apple launched the iPhone, and then spawned the app ecosystem. –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, are these all going to become just filtered only through the lens of what those companies think is important? Is it going to remain open? Where do you kind of see this playing out… I mean, it&#8217;s so early days; but like, how do they all talk to each other &#8212; or should they even?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaggie:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think at this time, the goal is to get the growth of the different app stores…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you make a great point that there might be an overproliferation &#8212; we could say the same thing about the prevalence of blockchains themselves &#8212; I do think there will need to be some sort of bridging function or consolidation from these; But for now, at least to see these viable alternatives is really exciting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, the Worldchain example is interesting because these are verifiable humans; so, I just peeked into one of their mini apps and it has something like 600,000 registered users. And so I think we should focus on that&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd at some point, you need then the curation to balance that out. This has been happening for a while with some of our NFTs communities: They have lots and lots of eyeballs that are really excited to dig into other web3 applications. And so, I think we&#8217;ll start to see some of them also acting as these curation marketplaces for things that are built in their ecosystem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. I was just going to ask &#8212; You know, one thing that a company like Apple would argue is that because of the curation that they provide, they are owed some fee on both the purchases or th-the activity that goes on in their app store.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does that square with the \u003Cem\u003Epermissionlessness\u003C\u002Fem\u003E that you see in the crypto arena?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaggie:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I would say at this point, there isn&#8217;t a lot of thoughtful curation. So I would disagree with the first part of that, potentially.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second part of that, the great thing about crypto is that you can then move to another platform.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilar thing, games need quite a bit of capital to launch. And for the past several years, blockchains have acted not just as a platform to build upon, but a publisher as well as a distribution and discovery mechanism. And what I&#8217;ve been seeing is many of these game chains now have their own marketplaces, and they&#8217;re able to feature key games that are built on those blockchains. And that is a key benefit because they are able to take users and move them from game to game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is the thesis of a lot of our investments; I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;ll be stuck in any one of these decentralized app stores, for example.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love watching all these experiments!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike the Solana phone &#8212; it like breaks every rule, you know: Don&#8217;t compete with Apple on like the iPhone &#8212; and then they&#8217;re just like, screw it, we&#8217;re going to do that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, Toly did a wonderful job on our podcast explaining some of the impetus behind it; and-and the innovation bet that they were making with it, which I think was fantastic. So I just want to call out that episode in case listeners haven&#8217;t heard it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah that&#8217;s a great one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And then one other point, Maggie – you brought up, it&#8217;s actually not all fun and games; there are some challenges as well… Which is, for example, you know:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a product has existing distribution on messaging apps, it&#8217;s hard to port that distribution onchain &#8212; and that&#8217;s one of the things that&#8217;s going to be difficult for some of these companies that are maybe Web2 coming to web3; One example you cited was Telegram and the TON network. (I want to be very clear, we&#8217;re not talking about the token, just the network.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaggie:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think Telegram has been one of the exceptions;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I&#8217;ve heard from speaking firsthand to many, many organizations that have large incumbent distribution &#8212; so they might have a platform in Web2, they might actually have something like web3 &#8212; is that- it’s- they still find it hard to bring those users on chain.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne example that you can look at the public data &#8212; Coinbase has something like 100 million verified users that have ever uh transacted Coinbase: If you look at both the active users &#8212; so the daily active monthly, that&#8217;s something like 8 or 10 million transacting. And the number of those users on Base, I think those numbers have just went up recently, they went up from something like 10 million to 18 million.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that&#8217;s still about 10% of their total base. So there&#8217;s this large number of \u003Cem\u003Edormant\u003C\u002Fem\u003E users. And we actually talk about this in our State of Crypto report, which I think is fascinating &#8212; because it&#8217;s absolutely true: You talk to any large &#8212; could be a messaging app, it could be a centralized exchange, anything like this &#8212; And they&#8217;re all trying to figure out: We got them in somehow, they created an account, but they haven&#8217;t done anything more; how can we keep them coming back and transacting onchain?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yup. I agree. Maggie, thank you so much for joining.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaggie:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thank you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s really fascinating to think that there are so many people out there who-who have crypto, they hold it, they&#8217;ve interacted with it &#8212; but they&#8217;re just not doing anything yet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey&#8217;re sort of like lying in wait, they&#8217;re dormant, just like &lt;chuckles&gt; waiting to get activated: They&#8217;ve got like the broadband going to their house, they&#8217;ve got the phones in their pockets, they&#8217;re just like, what do I do with this new tech I have?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it&#8217;s just a matter of switching that on… and people becoming like really actively transacting with it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet&#8217;s hear what&#8217;s next.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E When we were doing the State of Crypto report, we really wanted to do our best to size up the crypto industry. There&#8217;s a lot of noise out there… you know, measuring users is very tricky in the crypto world for a number of reasons;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut when we did this market-sizing exercise, we actually found that only 5-10% of people who \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C\u002Fem\u003E crypto are actively \u003Cem\u003Eusing\u003C\u002Fem\u003E crypto. And to me, that stood out as a big gap… But also a really big opportunity for the industry &#8212; given where we&#8217;re at, on the technology timeline with blockchains and the infrastructure getting better; the UX continues to get better. &#8212; And I think we&#8217;re finally ready for primetime.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd given where we&#8217;re at on that curve, I think you know this next year is the perfect time to bring people onchain, convert those passive crypto holders into active crypto users.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E For me, that was a very eye-opening idea, because so many people talk about mainstreaming these new users, and it feels &#8212; not like insurmountable, but it feels like it&#8217;s skipping-a-phase, stage-wise, in the technology readiness and development &#8212; And your idea was like a wonderful bridge to like: Here&#8217;s a way to bring in existing people, convert them into users.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you guys have any theories about what brought them &#8212; I mean, we don&#8217;t know the exact answer, obviously, because we don&#8217;t have that data &#8212; But like, what do you think they did in the first place; and then why they stalled out, before they did something else?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, this is like the perfect time to talk about the price-innovation cycle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Sure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have this concept, which is this idea that when crypto prices go up, people get interested. And then people that get interested, ultimately decide to build something; the developers come in, they build the products; and those products then kickstart the next wave.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we&#8217;ve seen this happen now many times over the- the history of crypto. And it speaks to the fact that prices are often a leading indicator for the types of activity that we- we want to see. And I think we&#8217;re at the beginning of potentially the next wave.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So sorry, just to be more concrete about it though &#8212; ‘cause I totally agree that&#8217;s a great framework for it &#8212; like, if I were to speculate, a lot of these people that came on, that got wallets might have done it to buy an NFT… Because they saw like Constitution DAO &#8212; remember when all those people were trying to buy the U.S. Constitution? &#8212; I think one of the most exciting things about that is that even though they failed their bid (to win the Constitution), they…it brought a lot of new people into crypto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that&#8217;s probably the only thing they did, and then they didn&#8217;t do anything more with it &#8212; I mean, again, we don&#8217;t know exactly but like that&#8217;s what I would sort of speculate &#8212; and then now they&#8217;re just holding these wallets, but they&#8217;re not active users.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess… the question I have: What do you think would take to get them like to that next thing? Like, what is that gap?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. Crypto as a technology has a number of different use cases, but it also kind of has these different movements underpinning the technology &#8212; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2024, for example, we saw a lot of progress with crypto as a political movement; we saw key politicians and policymakers speaking very positively about the technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also saw it make incredible developments as a financial movement, right; so Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs were approved, which broadened investor access.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, these are the types of things that ultimately bring a lot of people into the space, make them aware that this is something that they can participate in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAh but where we believe crypto has the most promise is as a computing movement. And Chris Dixon talks a lot about this in his book, Read Write Own: The real power of this technology is to create a, better version of the internet that is more fair uh and open and transparent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think we are, like I said, at the inflection point here: Where we may in 2025 see more developments of crypto as a computing movement. Because, you know we have the people that are in there, right. And with the infrastructure developments we&#8217;ve seen, with fees coming down, with the UX improvements, with new application categories starting to emerge… We, potentially, could see a killer app &#8212; like ChatGPT kind of showed us on the AI side &#8212; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; that really kickstarts the entire industry… Uh and kind of delivers on the promise of crypto as a computing movement, a new internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that&#8217;s what I think I, and a lot of the team, here is-is really excited to watch.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, this is something that we&#8217;ve talked a lot about &#8212; but the fact that stablecoins are, they&#8217;ve found product-market fit &#8212; And, all it really is going to take is one big company to realize that they you know not paying merchant fees on credit card transactions with your customers could be tremendously profitable for them &#8212; like transformative for their bottom line, for these thin-margin businesses –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s gonna take one big company to do that before like this thing takes off. At least, that&#8217;s one pathway where you could see this thing kind of hit the big time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, I&#8217;ll add just that: What I again find very interesting about your idea &#8212; is that notion of bringing adjacent users; and then, and then when we&#8217;re ready, we bring in more of the mainstream users. And we were not ready for that on the UX side anyway…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause when you really think about the \u003Cem\u003Emainstream\u003C\u002Fem\u003E users? I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re going to come through these paths. They&#8217;re going to be &#8212; those interfaces are going to be very abstracted away from them; they might not even know they&#8217;re using crypto. And so it&#8217;s actually really interesting when you think about all these different waves that are going to come in through all these different paths; it&#8217;s very exciting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, Daren. Thank you so much.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Awesome. Thank you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Okay! So, now on to, the next one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, Joachim, to quickly summarize: Your idea was builders will reuse, not just reinvent infrastructure. And your main point you talk about is how it seems like we always see a bespoke validator set, consensus protocol, da da da… And what you say in the post is “the outcomes were sometimes only slightly better in specialized functionality &#8212; but they often lacked in broader or baseline functionality”; That this year you expect to see crypto builders leverage more of the contributions of each other &#8212; like using off-the-shelf infrastructure &#8212; and that it&#8217;ll save them time and effort; but really allow them to really focus on differentiating the value of their product.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich I think is a fantastic big idea; much needed call to action even.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the quick question I have for you, is: Sounds like it&#8217;s great in theory, will it actually happen? And like what do you see as maybe obstacles… of making this happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJoachim:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think the crucial ingredient for this idea is… whether or not the tech stack keeps changing going forward. &lt;Sonal: Yup&gt; If the hypothesis is correct uh that the tech stack has stabilized or is stabilizing &#8212; and we see certain layers of the tech stack getting well-defined in terms of their interface, and how they interoperate with other layers of the tech stack &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen you would expect that those layers &#8212; there&#8217;s specialized teams, specialized products, specialized services &#8212; working and improving these layers; and that leads to the professionalization of those layers. And you know, then instead of being spread across the stack &#8212; like working on each of these layers simultaneously &#8212; it becomes prudent to basically focus on the pieces of the stack that you can make the most impact on. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the critical question here is: Has the tech stack uh materialized enough, and stabilized enough? If there&#8217;s like a surprising turn, you know around the corner that turns the tech stack upside down; then this may not happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Joachim, so your point about people sort of gravitating toward certain products or services or components that are existing out there… It makes me wonder: When do you know that the tech is actually good enough, to say: Okay, we are going to use this tech; we&#8217;re not going to try to build something new and better than what already exists off the shelf.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a great question; you&#8217;re basically asking how do you know as a builder?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, yeah. Because it&#8217;s nice to say just use something that&#8217;s already out there… But what if you&#8217;re like, but I think I can make something better than that. &lt;chuckles&gt; You know?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJoachim:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. I think advice that I would give that person is to always be aware of the larger ecosystem, and the larger ramifications, and the larger use case or application…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s a wider context that the product or service is going to be used in, than you may perhaps initially think. &lt;Sonal: Yes!&gt; So one can make an analogy with like, a car right:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo maybe you&#8217;re very, very good at like building engines. And your idea is I&#8217;m going to build a new car; you know, I&#8217;m really good at building engines. And that&#8217;s really the one key distinguishing factor.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut your customer will not only want to have like a fantastic engine, right? &#8212; The car also has to have like a reasonable stereo; or the-it has to have like you know reasonable seats; it has to maybe have air conditioning, right &#8212; Are you gonna like reinvent all those parts as well?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr: is there a way for you to focus on the one thing that you&#8217;re very, very good at &#8212; while leveraging best-of-class products that are provided by others &#8212; that provide other parts to the stack.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s fantastic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s a great analogy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a perfect analogy, actually.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E But it’s also- it’s also very apt coming from you, Joachim, because you&#8217;re German; and in Germany, they have all these very, very specialized auto-parts makers &lt;Sonal laughs&gt; that like completely make like the best possible tiny component in the BMW car &lt;Sonal giggles&gt; that like nobody else can top… So it&#8217;s&#8230; it’s also extra.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m just laughing because I can&#8217;t believe you went there, but that&#8217;s a great point. &lt;laughs&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right. It&#8217;s easy to say when you have the best car components around.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;Joachim chuckles&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJoachim, you know, I was joking with you about this big idea that one of my personal observations is that: I think people in crypto have this thing which I call “constraints porn” – That there&#8217;s a lot of people in this early phase of crypto that are just really into it because of the constraints –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think your big idea is going to be very annoying for that crowd, because they actually really like that part of the problem. And in a way, your big idea actually welcomes more new builders to the space &#8212; which is quite democratizing (in my opinion).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJoachim:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, it&#8217;s really an amazing time to build in this space, right, because so many so many code bases that people can tap into when they build their products, or their services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, there&#8217;s really so little you have to genuinely do yourself, right? Like uh you can really focus on what you&#8217;re good at. And for everything else, there&#8217;s highly specialized parts already out there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, probably a good idea to reuse them whenever you can. And tap into the expertise of other teams, of people who build on other parts of the stack.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thank you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Wonderful; thank you Joachim. And now, we have the last one &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, Chris, you&#8217;ve had a lot of different roles at a16z over the last decade; but in your job, you come across a lot, and you work with, and you&#8217;ve onboarded a lot of, fashion, music, media executives into web3. And so I think your vantage point is not just speaking for yourself, but thousands of the people that you&#8217;ve met with –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, can you tell us, like, your big point for 2025?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Of course, of course.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, my big idea for 2025 &#8212; which has been my big idea for 2024, and 2023, and 2022 &lt;chuckles&gt; &#8212; but I think now we finally are at a state where, you know, we can really make this happen: I call it “hiding the wires”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, what that means is that &#8212; obviously everybody knows the benefits of crypto, and how it&#8217;s gonna be the future of so many different industries; whether it&#8217;s music, whether it&#8217;s fashion, film; the power of ownership, the power of decentralization –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, there&#8217;s a little bit of a- lack of knowledge from people that aren&#8217;t in the crypto industry when we&#8217;re using, you know, technical terms like ZK rollups, or L2s, or gas, or gas fees. And I just have a big PSA to the crypto industry that, We don&#8217;t need to start with the phrase of: hey, this is an “NFT” (project); or hey this is a token; or hey, you know, if you connect your wallet into the-\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike, those are great things for people in the crypto industry. But if you&#8217;re gonna really take something and have it go mainstream, we can&#8217;t lead with the technical terms. Because unfortunately, most people do not know &#8212; nor do they care.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what I mean by “hiding the wires” is: Not necessarily leading with the technical infrastructure, with the technical terms, the technical products &#8212; that obviously are the benefits \u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the application &#8212; but don&#8217;t necessarily need to be the overarching \u003Cem\u003Esell\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love this thesis ‘cause it&#8217;s just like cutting through the jargon… And like okay, we talk about NFTs: What is a non-fungible token? Doesn&#8217;t really matter. What matters is it&#8217;s a way for creators to get paid. &lt;Chris: Exactly&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr like, even somebody at our own company the other day was like, why do I need a stablecoin? But like, what if he didn&#8217;t call it a stablecoin &#8212; and it was just a way to save like 50 bucks over the course of a year on coffees that you&#8217;re buying, you know? &lt;Chris: Exactly!&gt; All of a sudden it&#8217;s like, oh, whatever it&#8217;s called, I don&#8217;t know; I want it, because it makes sense.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I want it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I can&#8217;t believe we didn&#8217;t have this beforehand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know, I came from the music industry. And… When I used to go to conferences, nobody ever went to an “MP3” conference, you know. Like why are we starting conferences in using technical terms in order to try and attract mainstream users into the space? But we&#8217;re very happy to put an NFT conference on a billboard at any moment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA great example is the SMTP, right? Like that&#8217;s actually like a extremely technical protocol &#8212; you know where anybody could build on top of it &#8212; But through apps like Gmail, and Superhuman, and YahooMail, and all these things, made it extremely simple for people to utilize and get the benefits of SMTP software.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I&#8217;m sending emails and blasting back and forth, and crushing through my day, I&#8217;m not thinking “oh, wow, like, this SMTP software is working perfectly”; I&#8217;m just doing what I have to do. And because of that, I&#8217;m getting the benefits of the technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think the same thing really needs to happen when it comes to crypto &#8212; where there&#8217;s so much benefits: I mean, you think about decentralization; you think about you know, ownership; you think about knowing your customers, and disrupting middlemen, and you know being able to have direct commun-&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean, my hope is that for next year: If we can have more businesses and more companies that are thinking that intuitively for the customer and for the everyday people, it&#8217;s going to get us creating new industries… And re-imagining how the future of creatives; how the future of small\u002F medium businesses; the future of restaurants, you name it &#8212; will all be able to leverage the benefits of crypto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And interestingly enough, all those people you cited \u003Cem\u003E&#8212;\u003C\u002Fem\u003E creators, the small businesses, etc. &#8212; are the ones that would benefit the most from the features of crypto… But to your point, they&#8217;re not able to directly access it. Yet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly! And it&#8217;s not their fault; it&#8217;s not their job to understand how to swap tokens, or to you know have different wallets that go off to different chains. Like they just want to be able to get access to the benefits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why we&#8217;re all working in this space; and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m most excited about.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s perfect. And a great note to end on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;transition music&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, why don&#8217;t we start by just riffing off what we see are the kind of cross-cutting themes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, I think this year I noticed three broad categories of topics &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; that people brought up for their big ideas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst section was having to do with AI &#8212; and the intersection of AI and crypto, which is no surprise; &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; it&#8217;s been just a total, you know, momentous year for AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second bucket I would describe as&#8230; You know, we like to talk about digi fizzy here.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh, god, I hate that phrase, but yes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I know! It&#8217;s a rough word. But this kind of coming together of the digital and physical worlds&#8230; &lt;Sonal: Oh, interesting&gt; &#8230;in a sort of practical way. &lt;mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, you know, that&#8217;s everything from payments, to voting, to kind of creating networks for physical infrastructure… So maybe AI is like the software side, maybe this is more of like the hardware- or the hardware of like reality, and life, and living.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E By the way, on that second theme, that&#8217;s so interesting because I would never have categorized it that way &#8212; but now that you say that, I see exactly what you mean: Because there&#8217;s an example of, like&#8230;there&#8217;s examples of tokenizing things in the physical world, tokeniz- putting bonds on chain. …I mean, one of the examples is even using your own physical body and biometric data, and tokenizing that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you&#8217;re right! That is interesting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right. I mean, how much more physical can you get?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. We can&#8230; I wish I could cut you saying “digi fizzy”, but hey, &lt;Robert chuckles&gt; uh I&#8217;ll take it because that is what&#8230; By the way, where do you stand on digi fizzy versus phygital?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E They&#8217;re both terrible words.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E They&#8217;re really awful. “Phygital” to me is far worse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m holding out for something better.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes, me too. We&#8217;ll have to coin something. Anyway. Yeah, and that&#8217;s cool. I didn&#8217;t see it that way, but I agree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat&#8217;s the third thing you see?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And then maybe I&#8217;d rank the third category as just like generally the tech improving &#8212; Like, kind of taking what has happened over the past year, and just sort of incrementing it up: What will happen if everything gets a little bit better, a little bit easier to use, a little bit more smooth and seamless. &lt;Sonal: Yeah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd just kind of… yah. So I feel like those are the three kind of categories that I was detecting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E On the last one, I thought of that more as just really significantly improved user experience &#8212; and a little bit more of a maturing of an industry that&#8217;s-that’s more ready to think about the people first versus the technology first. &lt;Robert: mm&gt; That&#8217;s how I categorize that last theme.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo for instance, like Jochem talks about how, you know, people don&#8217;t have to design everything from scratch &#8212; you can actually build things and use off the shelf components and repurpose them. Chris Lyons talks about the other extreme: Which is, hey, you may not even know you&#8217;re using it as crypto. And then Mason talked about how like &#8212; just as a mindset shift cutting across both of these &#8212; that people will start with thinking of what they&#8217;re trying to solve for, and then the technology will follow. Versus the other way around, which seems like how the industry has led. And I think it&#8217;s exactly because of the improvements that you&#8217;re describing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere would you put Maggie&#8217;s discovery one on this list, like, app stores.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s such a good one. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; I would rank that one as kind of a crossover between the second bucket and third bucket: The second being this kind of merging of the digital and physical. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, she has this nice point she makes about how we&#8217;re seeing some crypto hardware &#8212; like World App&#8217;s Orb; and uh Solana&#8217;s mobile phone &#8212; kind of leading to these app-store experiences that would sort of kind of &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to say mimic, but would at least echo &#8212; the way that previous generations of the web kind of hit it big.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Like the iPhone and its App Store.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The iPhone and the app&#8230; Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, yah exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that&#8217;s interesting because I would agree &#8212; but I would maybe put a twist on Maggie&#8217;s, where it&#8217;s actually kind of an interesting contradiction too: Because on one hand we&#8217;re saying, hey, crypto could be very poised for the mainstream or even the &#8212; as Daren would argue, the \u003Cem\u003Eadjacent\u003C\u002Fem\u003E mainstream (which is the people who are already wallet owners, but not users) &#8212; But in Maggie&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s also very interesting because she&#8217;s also talking about crypto having its own area, and like having its own App Store essentially.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut you know, as we&#8217;ve seen with like recent discussions around debanking and-and other things, like a lot of these App Stores were kicking crypto out, and not ready for it yet; &lt;Robert: yah&gt; And obviously, their positions have changed &#8212; like, Coinbase just announced that Apple Wallet integration &#8212; But there&#8217;s enough crypto apps that crypto can have its own App Store, which is very interesting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah; debanking has become this like big topic of conversation &#8212; this issue of crypto businesses, startups, and also people kind of losing access to the financial system unfairly; and without any explanation or justification as to why &#8212; And we see something similar from the tech perspective, where you have deplatforming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you mentioned this with the App Stores, you know, when an app doesn&#8217;t get greenlit for an App Store or it gets removed inexplicably.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And by the way, for arguably similar reasons &#8212; because as you saw in our debanking explainer, sometimes it&#8217;s very justifiable; like, a bank is allowed to &#8212; And sometimes the App Stores will argue it&#8217;s for security reasons, or some other quote-&#8220;good&#8221; reason. And oftentimes it might be… But a lot of times you&#8217;re like, huh, not really.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And so I see &#8212; like, part of that third bucket I was describing, of like things getting a little bit better? I think you could also describe it as kind of like crypto holding its own&#8230;as its own kind of platform.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, you know, Miles&#8217;&#8230;his big idea, he talks about how you know this piece of legislation that Wyoming recently passed &#8212; the DUNA, the Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association &#8212; It recognizes these communities as legal entities to operate protocols. &lt;Sonal: That’s great&gt; and to operate crypto startups in a decentralized manner, &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; for the first time. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is a platform that, like, didn&#8217;t exist before… People were kind of just flying the plane and kind of; you know, whatever, the tech works. But it didn&#8217;t have an exact spot to fit in the legal framework.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right! Well, a lot like Maggie&#8217;s point &#8212; where it&#8217;s a little bit like crypto, the DAOs (the decentralized autonomous organizations) need their own legal entity structure that&#8217;s not only an LLC… but something, you know, just like we have a corporation, an LLC, and this is like a version that&#8217;s that works for decentralized autonomous communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat&#8217;s a very good point. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re bringing that one up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you liked what you heard, we cover these topics biweekly in our newsletter; you can find the sign up for the newsletter on the a16zcrypto.com website.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck it out and subscribe.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Awesome.

We were at McKinsey, and, in many ways it was a really great experience. But if you say like Why did you end up there? &lt;Sonal: No, heck no!&gt; &lt;laughs&gt; it wasn&#8217;t because, at six years old, I was running around the kitchen being like, &#8220;Mommy, mommy, I want to be a management consultant.&#8221; It was the path. &lt;Sonal: That’s right&gt; It was what people did in whatever it was, 2008, when I graduated.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, you know, our view was if you really want to move the needle on like increasing the supply of great founders, you can&#8217;t wait for them to figure out that like, that&#8217;s the obvious path &#8212; you have to create a path, &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; and that&#8217;s what Entrepreneur First has been about from the beginning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things that we think about a lot is like the nature of ambition… &lt;Sonal: mmm!&gt; and how it&#8217;s very culturally determined.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ooh! let&#8217;s talk about that…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well what I mean by that is it&#8217;s not like all ambitious people have the same… like, vision of how to realize their ambition, you know like &#8212; &lt;Sonal: that’s absolutely true&gt; And so, you know, it would be the craziest thing in the world to try and force people to be entrepreneurs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut we have quite a big team now around the world, and they go out and they find people who are clearly extraordinarily talented but at the very start of their journey &#8212; we typically focus on people early in their career, sometimes like you know, while they&#8217;re at university or equivalent &#8212; And you know their job, yes, obviously, is to help them think about startups and, if they want to build a startup, bring them into our community and help them do that; But their job is not to push where it&#8217;s not right. It&#8217;s to genuinely be almost like a career… counselor, like a, like an actual, someone whose interest is shared with the person.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, one of the things that we believe &#8212; if you like our theory of change &#8212; is that if you can actually intervene at a point where people are trying to figure out like, wh-How do I have this talent? &lt;Yes&gt; How do I maximize my impact in the world? &#8212; and you can show them this path of entrepreneurship and show what&#8217;s possible &#8212; then actually that will increase the supply of great founders, and then great companies in the world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So I do want to pick up a little bit on two threads &#8212; One, about this-what you said about the nature of ambition, something you think about a lot; but also what you said about this culturally determined aspect of it &#8212; and that, to me, suggests some of the structural context\u002F the surrounding context that supports entrepreneurship. Beyond the individual.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo let&#8217;s split it up into the people, and then the surrounding &lt;Matt: Yah… yah&gt; kind of content and ecosystem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, on the surrounding context and ecosystem: One kind of obvious thing&#8230;this is something we talked about a lot &#8212; In the early days, in the a16z podcast, I recorded a lot of episodes with, like, Iranian entrepreneurs and various people around the world, and it was really fascinating how the risk tolerance is very different culturally in different regions. &lt;yah&gt; And one thing that I think, it&#8217;s so cliché, but it is true for a reason, is unique about Silicon Valley is there is a tremendous tolerance &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to say the word “failure”, because I hate veering into failure porn; &lt;Matt: Yah, I totally agree&gt; I think that&#8217;s the wrong way to&#8230; It&#8217;s, like, actually… &#8212; &lt;Matt: Failure sucks, always&gt; &#8212; Well, I hate when people are, like, “Failure Friday”, and failure this &#8212; Like, yes, of course, normalize talking about it, recovering, repairing, but don&#8217;t, like, glorify failure for god&#8217;s sake; everyone wants to succeed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what&#8217;s really interesting about it is that there is, like, this forgiveness and recovery and resilience that &#8212; whereas in certain cultural regions and areas, there&#8217;s almost, like, a punishment or a feeling of self-hatred if you don&#8217;t succeed. This is even beyond individual level; I&#8217;m talking about like culturally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E No, totally. So I think there&#8217;s two things: One is attitudes to failure. But I think it&#8217;s also what is valued? What is esteemed?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean like the really special thing about Silicon Valley is this idea that if you&#8217;re in Silicon Valley and if you tell- you tell someone you&#8217;re a founder, that immediately has a set of connotations &lt;Sonal: You’re right&gt; that are almost exclusively positive &lt;Sonal: yes&gt;, is very legible. People know what you mean. People can read that as a sign that you are ambitious. &lt;Sonal: That&#8217;s right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we started Entrepreneur First, there was this slight sense that if you said you were a founder… that was a euphemism for you were unemployed. &lt;Yah&gt; And so actually, I think the cultural meaning of entrepreneurship is one of the biggest sources of leverage you have, just like making it like: This is a thing that smart, capable, ambitious people do; and it&#8217;s a vehicle for changing the world. It’s- it&#8217;s such a powerful idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd to give you a really concrete example &#8212; because I think like from the UK and the U.S., similar enough systems that it really resonates, but: &#8212; you know, the first international office we opened was in Singapore.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, in Singapore, the #1 career path for the smartest, most ambitious people is to go be a civil servant. As a result, the government of Singapore is probably one of the most effective and efficient.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s so interesting. &lt;Yah!&gt; I didn&#8217;t know that. It&#8217;s actually the opposite in so many other places.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;ve just been serving in government; actually, the people have been amazing! But I would say, like:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, the cultural value of entrepreneurship in Singapore, it&#8217;s just been very&#8230;I think it&#8217;s been harder there to sort of create this sense that like, if you say you&#8217;re a founder, you&#8217;re doing something that&#8217;s as like legitimate, as prestigious, as your friends that have gone off to be, you know-\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes! We should talk for a second about why entrepreneurship for a minute, because it seems like an obvious thing. Like what are we talking about; this is a show, a startup focus &#8212; we&#8217;re both startup-focused cultures. But actually, it&#8217;s not obvious.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s not obvious.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, if I were telling a policymaker &#8212; I think they know this, but like: The reality is startups represent innovation. They&#8217;re an engine of growth. They create jobs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey&#8217;re create- they’re generative. They&#8217;re not extractive. They&#8217;re not just taking the stable what you already have, that&#8217;s established. They set you up for the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean, there&#8217;s so many&#8230;there&#8217;s layers and layers of why this matters, so just to kind of hit on that; But to your point &#8212; so I have to ask you this then &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to be stereotypical, but of course, there&#8217;s going to be some generalizations just to kind of understand this – But:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy impression of London &#8212; I&#8217;m born and raised in the United States, but my grandparents settled in London; this is in the &#8217;70s, before I was born &#8212; And the impression I got from- culturally is that there&#8217;s kind of, like &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to say classist, but very much a \u003Cem\u003Ecredentialist\u003C\u002Fem\u003E society: Like, you care very much about what school you went to. And I think that could be true in some ways in Silicon Valley, but, people kind of don&#8217;t really care what school you went to… or what you did… Would you say that is true today? Do you think that&#8217;s evolving? And I&#8217;m bringing this up because you mentioned this point about what \u003Cem\u003Evalue \u003C\u002Fem\u003E&lt;yah&gt; that certain words and these concepts signal. So, I&#8217;m curious for your perspective there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know, I- one of the essays that I wrote when we&#8217;re early on in EF that was trying to talk to this, that I called “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fpulse\u002F2016-stop-badge-collecting-start-startup-matt-clifford\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDon&#8217;t Be a Badge Collector\u003C\u002Fa\u003E”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I probably wrote that around the time I was first on the podcast, &lt;yah&gt; but I think it&#8217;s held up pretty well. And what I was saying is like, I think there is a cultural temptation (let&#8217;s call it), in the UK to be like, I&#8217;m going to work really hard to get into the best university I can, so I can get the best graduate job I can…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one of the biggest risks for smart people, I think, is that you get into a mode where success is measured by whether you make your boss look good. And their success is measured by whether they make their boss look good and seeing, like all the way up, what you&#8217;re actually doing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo your point about, you know, you mentioned, like, startups are a positive-sum game. There&#8217;s a risk in a lot of career tracks that – that, I&#8217;m not saying you&#8217;re not creating value, but your actual goal is to win the upward political battle within whatever bureaucratic structure you&#8217;re in, right? (When I say political, I mean small “p” &#8212; I mean, this can be in big corporates or it can be in, you know, whatever.) &#8211;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think what&#8217;s beautiful about startups &#8212;  and the reason, you know, I&#8217;ve spent more or less my entire career helping people build them &#8212; is that they&#8217;re ultimately all about what you can do for other people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s… fantastic way of framing it!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You only succeed if you build something that is so valuable that someone else will pay for it. &lt;Yesss&gt; You cannot win in any other way. There is no boss to make it look good. There is no like grading scheme that some teacher is going to tell you got an A on. &lt;yes!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt comes down to this very start thing: Did you do something for someone else that they thought was so great they wrote you a check?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s right. And it is not people-pleasing, because often, you&#8217;re going against established convention. &lt;Matt: Absolutely&gt; You&#8217;re often butting your head or punching through an industry that is not accepting a new way of doing things. &lt;Matt: Absolutely&gt; (I&#8217;m just thinking of my former partner, Martin Casado, and the enterprise team, when he was doing, software-defined networking; he was punching against very established old-school methods for what networking looked like &#8212; that was very hardware-based. And so it&#8217;s like, you have to literally punch, like, you&#8217;re completely going against all conventions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The bar is so high to actually prove that that value is &lt;yes, yes&gt; &#8230; And do you think-I sometimes think one of the challenges we face today is that if you are smart and ambitious, it&#8217;s now so easy (in some senses) to find a comfortable path &#8212; that is about making your boss look good all the way through a career and acquiring money and influence and prestige but actually maybe never really doing something that creates an enormous amount of value. You know, like…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, now that you say it, it seems SO obvious &#8212; but it&#8217;s really not. Like, just to pause on the idea: When you&#8217;re doing a startup, you&#8217;re building something that other people want and need. That&#8217;s a really profound idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn that note: It&#8217;s also very fascinating because of the economics of startups, &lt;Matt: mmm&gt; Because usually, if you&#8217;re working for a company &#8212; you were talking about you and Alice being at McKinsey, consulting &#8212; people think they&#8217;re making good money… but you&#8217;re really captive to your salary. Actually, the wealth is not generative.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one thing that I think is really powerful about startups is that startups are the ones that innovated on the idea that employees can have a share of the returns on the work they do. So even though you might be building a product for customers and consumers that people want, if you succeed &#8212; you know, it can also go to nothing; obviously, that&#8217;s a very real risk &#8212; But if you succeed… there can be very real gains for the people who put things in, especially for those that took a risk early on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI don&#8217;t know how the options and the economics work in UK startups &#8212; but that is, I think, a defining feature of Silicon Valley in the early days. &lt;Absolutely&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so I just wanted to point that out because it&#8217;s actually resonant to what you said about not only pleasing people and being captive &#8212; but you&#8217;re also helping other people and then actually creating value for the employees too. \u003Cem\u003ETh\u003C\u002Fem\u003Eey&#8217;re always increasing the size of the pie &#8212; for everyone &#8212; in some form. So I mean not to be cliché, but that&#8217;s very true.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know, in a way I think there&#8217;s a really important sort of ethical point here, which is: That founders, yeah, they can make a lot of money, but they only get to capture value that they create. &lt;Sonal: That&#8217;s right.&gt; And I think that that is actually a really important idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I find, again, we focus mainly on people early in their career when we&#8217;re working with founders, &lt;mhm&gt; and I just think that idea really resonates with people. Yeah, of course, they would like to be successful, but they want to do it within a framework where they feel they create something.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Of course! &lt;yah&gt; I mean, otherwise, it&#8217;s just gambling and &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8212; Or extraction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Extraction, exactly. It&#8217;s like value-add versus value extraction, &lt;yah&gt; exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, it&#8217;s funny though because it&#8217;s also&#8230;you know, I&#8217;m not going to get political- at all political, but just in terms of capitalism, stakeholders, people having a voice, and empowerment:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw this list, it periodically makes its round on Twitter, of people &#8212; the most wealthy families, in Europe &#8212; And that list of the top five has not changed over centuries. &lt;yah&gt; Which is crazy because that just means it&#8217;s generational wealth passing along. Whereas in the United States, that list is (I mean, granted it&#8217;s younger country) but at the same time, the list is changing constantly! The top 10 wealthy people, the top 5 wealthy people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, it&#8217;s not about the money &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to make that the focus &#8212; but just pointing out that when you think of this dynamism? &lt;Matt: yah&gt; &#8212; This thing that a culture can change, be advanced, add new value, startups can be generative;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s just really interesting to me because a lot of those people are startup-made; &lt;totally&gt; like most of those people are not access to old money.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right. And you know, I think again, not wanting to be political, but you know actually the thing that I think is nonpartisan, and everyone can agree on is that, actually, the thing we need is positive-sum games. &lt;Sonal: Oh, 100%&gt; You know the thing, like different people have different views on how we tax wealth…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the bit that everyone can agree on is: If people &#8212; what we want to reward in society, is people that are creating valuable things. We don&#8217;t want to reward extraction. And one of the beautiful things about startups is they can&#8217;t extract; they&#8217;ve got to create! And I just think there&#8217;s just something very valuable about that and very powerful that actually I see people across the political spectrum sort of kind of getting behind.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, I agree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn this note, though &#8212; we&#8217;re talking about the structural context right now, before we move to the individual &#8212; so let&#8217;s add a little rigor to the what does “ecosystem” mean, because I know that can be very buzzword;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI&#8217;ve studied entrepreneurial ecosystems for a very long time, covered them for a very long time, as you know &#8212; and including like interviewing all these different people throughout the world who are experts in this, like, what an \u003Cem\u003Eecosystem\u003C\u002Fem\u003E means &#8212; and a couple of themes emerge:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne, you obviously need talent. You need really strong universities and research ecosystem. You also need, for the people that hate to admit this, government support.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the other thing is, there&#8217;s a really important balance between top-down and bottom-up. &lt;totally&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the bottom-up side: You obviously need communities of entrepreneurs, because there have been, as you know, many experiments, including planned cities, planned innovations, like, where people are trying to do these centrally planned top-down innovation initiatives, &lt;yah&gt;… They never work. Ever. There have been many, many, many over the years, and not one has worked. (Some argue Singapore; that&#8217;s a different, unique, complex case. And I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s as &#8220;entrepreneurial.&#8221; It&#8217;s a successful nation-state, &lt;right&gt; but that&#8217;s a separate thing.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that&#8217;s one aspect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, on the top-down side, you obviously need enabling conditions, like respect for property &#8212; like, in the U.S., we talk about respect for property rights. It can include respect for intellectual property. It can include support such as funding, like DARPA in the United States, which funded the internet, things like that… Supportive pro-innovation policies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, so the bottom-up side is the community, the top-down; and then, obviously, the talent that comes in the form of universities, because universities are drivers of research and innovation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo now on your point about the science and technology side, talk to me about what you think is happening uniquely in London, because we&#8217;re sitting here.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, yeah so  I mean, so you mentioned DARPA. My sort of side hustle outside Entrepreneurs First is I&#8217;m the non-executive chair of ARIA, which is a new government-backed, well, government-funded R&amp;D funding agency. It&#8217;s based on DARPA, basically.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What does ARIA stand for?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E ARIA stands for the Advanced Research and Invention Agency. &lt;Sonal: I know what you&#8217;re talking about, okay, yeah.&gt; So it&#8217;s been given (I guess in U.S. terms), about a billion dollars to basically fund breakthrough R&amp;D that might otherwise not get funded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo really trying to take some of what worked at DARPA &#8212; in particular, this idea of this program manager-led model…  &lt;yes yes yes&gt; Empowering brilliant scientists with visions to just go out and build the networks and coalitions of researchers to realize that vision in a way that&#8217;s all about, &lt;that’s right&gt; actually, a lot of things we&#8217;ve already been talking about: It&#8217;s about ambition, it&#8217;s about incentives, &lt;yup&gt; it&#8217;s about alignment, all these things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one of the things that&#8217;s been really striking to me in sort of roughly a year that we&#8217;ve been um up and running is:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Just the depth of the scientific talent &#8212; across the whole UK, so not just London or not just Oxford and Cambridge, but truly across the whole country.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E2) It&#8217;s almost like too strong a word but, like, the \u003Cem\u003Eyearning\u003C\u002Fem\u003E for something like this. &lt;wow!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, when you look at why does ARIA need to exist, we do a ton of great science in the UK, &#8212; and actually, I&#8217;m lucky to have been involved in a lot of the science funding organizations that exist &#8212; But I think one of the challenges is that with scale… comes a sort of more bureaucratic approach, right? &lt;yes&gt; And so if you&#8217;re trying to run science funding for a whole country, of course you need to show value for money for taxpayers, and you need to sort of have a lot of process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the consequence of that &#8212; and it&#8217;s not a UK thing, this is a global thing &#8212; and people like Patrick Collison and others have written about, the challenges of where science has got to &#8212; I think of it as a career\u002F ambition\u002F incentive problem. So if you go talk to incredible postdocs across the UK, across the U.S., and you say, &#8220;What&#8217;s your most ambitious idea?&#8221; And they tell you. And then you say, &#8220;Cool. And so you&#8217;re working on that?&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;No.&#8221; You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, because I need to get this next publication, which needs to get this many citations, &lt;yah&gt; because then I&#8217;ll be able to get my next grant. And if I do that, then one day, I&#8217;ll be able in 10 years to get my own lab.&#8221; And then… you&#8217;re like, Wow, this is crazy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have some of the greatest minds of their generation playing a bit like the making-your-boss-look-good game. This is the making-the-grantmakers-happy game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s exactly the same thing. I&#8217;m so glad you brought that up because this is important. So I want to break down a little bit more about what you&#8217;re saying because, you know, a lot of people have tried different forms of how to fund R&amp;D &lt;yah&gt; and do it in a way &#8212; and industrial R&amp;D is what you&#8217;re talking about &#8212; and in a way, that&#8217;s efficient and a lot of lessons learned here, which I think are fascinating.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo one, you mentioned the concept of a program manager. &lt;yah&gt; For those that don&#8217;t know, like, DARPA had this famous model where they had program managers. And it&#8217;s quite fascinating because like one example is Regina George, you know, &lt;yah&gt; and she went to Google later on. But I remember being at Xerox PARC when her group funded (and this is public), advanced manufacturing initiative &lt;right&gt; and reconfiguring manufacturing and all these different things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd there&#8217;s so many different interesting things about it because, one, first of all, many of these initiatives can be very multidisciplinary; which universities are not well set up to do, where people are very siloed in their departments. &lt;totally&gt; And so having these grants can sometimes be like kind of these umbrellas for different disciplines to come together &#8212; including across multiple universities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. I was gonna say multiple universities, and sometimes even different sectors. So, like, universities and startups &lt;That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right&gt; and nonprofits or whatever. Yeah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That’s right… Totally. One example was, back in the day, we did content-centric networking. It was various types of things. So that&#8217;s one interesting thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second thing &#8212; this is a very little-known fact that people don&#8217;t know about this model, is&#8230;and I remember being fascinated by this when I was working with my colleagues, helping them out with some stuff at SRI, who were thinking about this &#8212; which is Stanford Research International, and they&#8217;re very famous for getting lots of research grants and different things &#8212; It&#8217;s fascinating, because most people, when they think of government funding and program managers, they think of it as being this one-way model &lt;mm&gt; where: Government gives money, program manager allocates it, someone has a strong point of view, and it goes A, B, C, D.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s actually much more nonlinear and interactive than that, &lt;yah&gt; &#8212; where you actually have smart scientists informing the program managers for what proposals they want to see. Because actually, the word in the grant-making business is: If you&#8217;re bidding on an RFP (request for proposal), by the time it comes out, you&#8217;re too late. &lt;right&gt; You should be shaping what proposals are coming out in the first place. And that is a two-way dialogue between the government &lt;Absolutely&gt; and universities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And that&#8217;s a big part of how ARIA is working and planning to work, which is to say &#8212; but hopefully in an extremely transparent way &#8212; Here is an area that we&#8217;re excited about where we think there is a thesis. Before we make grants, before we do an RFP, we want to workshop this with people that have a really broad range of views on it so that we know what are the things we should be looking out for? You know what I mean?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain, there&#8217;s a risk of a cliché here, but so much of the challenge of this stuff is you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know. &lt;Sonal: That&#8217;s exactly right&gt; Particularly across disciplinary boundaries.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s a lot of academic literature that suggests that surprise is the key to scientific breakthrough. Surprise comes when you have a different knowledge base or perspective&#8211;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh yeah, yeah. At Xerox PARC, JSB (who&#8217;s John Seely Brown, used to manage it back in the day), used to always say it&#8217;s at the interstitials, &lt;Matt: 100%&gt; at the edges, and these kind of in-between industries.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean, I do think that surprise or serendipity is very important, but I want to be careful that we don&#8217;t glorify innovation as this “aha, eureka!” moment when it&#8217;s many little things &lt;yah… totally&gt; that can come together incrementally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I actually think &#8212; but tell me if I&#8217;m wrong &#8212; when you say “surprise”, you also mean this emergent quality &lt;that’s exactly&gt; that you don&#8217;t know what you said, you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know, and it can actually come up bottom-up because you&#8217;re not top-down saying&#8230; Like, you can say, we know this is an interesting area. You may even have a loose hypothesis\u002F thesis &#8212; but you don&#8217;t have it so opinionated and targeted that you&#8217;re literally veering into central planning, which is where I would say places like China fail!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally. When I&#8217;m talking about surprise, I&#8217;m talking about almost exclusively a bottom-up phenomenon. &lt;yes… yes&gt; Like what happens when the biologist talks to the computer scientist about a problem that has roughly the same contours, and they never realized before the biologist? You know, and then you&#8217;re like, Oh, and that can be an incredibly productive thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You&#8217;re preaching to the choir because whenever I used to give tours &#8212; that wasn&#8217;t my job, but because I was the head of editorial at PARC &#8212; I did give like these muckety-mucks &lt;right&gt; the tours every now and then –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it was funny because one of the messages&#8230;it&#8217;s so true because they had always ask, like: How did this one place &#8212; not just once, not a one-hit-wonder &#8212; repeatedly create one innovation? And we&#8217;re talking world-changing innovations, Ethernet. &lt;Matt: Absolutely… absolutely&gt; I can&#8217;t even say… the GUI… there was endless lists of things that they did &#8212; lasers. And the big part of it had to do with this multidisciplinary thing &lt;100%&gt; and putting them in the same thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut here&#8217;s the other thing that people don&#8217;t know &#8212; and this ties to what we&#8217;re talking about &#8212; It wasn&#8217;t just you put a bunch of smart people from different disciplines in one building, and go, Hey, collaborate. &#8212; The founder of Xerox PARC gave them a mission. And the mission was: to build the office of the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s a very simple mission &#8212; broad enough to enable all kinds of innovation; yet specific enough to provide a funnel so it&#8217;s not like crazy town where people are like Oh, I want to build a sneaker that rolls down the hallways, and I can skate through the blah blah blah. You know. &lt;chuckles&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, yah, totally, 100%. I think that idea of mission, I mean, that&#8217;s the other bit that, you know, Ilan, our CEO at ARIA, has&#8230; I think one of the reasons I&#8217;m so happy he&#8217;s doing that job is that &#8212; just the sense of mission he has about what we&#8217;re trying to do. It&#8217;s just so palpable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s powerful. How did ARIA come about? Did the government approach you guys, did you guys approach the government; how did this come about?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh, yeah, the government created this by Act of Parliament early in 2022 &lt;mhm&gt; and then ran an open process to hire a CEO and a chair.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you know, I had been &#8212; probably, well, mainly because of the work I&#8217;ve been doing at EF &#8212; I&#8217;d been very interested in this idea of like, how do you do institutional innovation? &#8212; Because, you know, as you say, talent investing is a bit weird; it&#8217;s not the same as VC. &#8212; So you know I&#8217;ve always been interested in this, like: How do you do institutional innovation to increase the supply of-of things that you want? &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in a way, EF is trying to increase the supply of great founders. ARIA is trying to increase the supply of scientific breakthroughs &lt;mhm&gt; through this sort of institutional innovation. And so you know I wss, I just applied. And um slightly to my surprise, I got the job. &lt;Sonal: I&#8217;m not surprised&gt; I mean, Ilan was based over near home for you; he was in Berkeley, and he was running this incredible thing called the Activate fellowship &lt;yah&gt; &#8212; which is a-sort of deep- deep tech entrepreneurs out of academia.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What I think is very fascinating about you being involved, is the other part of having these &#8212; when you said their goal was to increase the number of scientific breakthroughs &#8212; The other half of it is, how do you then actually take those breakthroughs and make something of them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause as you know, there’s no shortage of brilliant ideas and things coming out, but, there has to be a system &lt;Matt: 100%&gt; that can absorb and help support and nurture it. And so I think it&#8217;s fascinating that you&#8217;re involved because then it&#8217;s also wait, you don&#8217;t only have to go through this classic linear model of university funding X &#8212; you may also be able to do a startup; you may collaborate with a big company; you could go here; a big company can acquire the patent … There&#8217;s such a variety.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting that you landed on that because I would say probably the most important structural strategic question we&#8217;ve had to answer for ARIA so far is: Who&#8217;s the customer? &lt;oh&gt; So if you think about DARPA, the D is defense. &lt;that’s right&gt; It&#8217;s pretty important. They&#8217;ve done a good job of doing this sort of bottom-up side of it, but there is a big like &lt;Sonal: There is a top-down, yeah&gt; They are building things that the Department of Defense ultimately has to- .\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, the internet was originally invented to be resilient in the case of a disaster. &lt;Matt: &#8230;disaster&gt; Right. Of course, it became something else. As is the case, but yeah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And we are We are ARIA. Not DARIA. We don&#8217;t have a big customer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that was a big, important decision, not to be&#8230;we are of government, but we&#8217;re very independent of it. We&#8217;re, what we call in the UK, a non-departmental public body, which basically means we&#8217;re outside government. &lt;Got it&gt; And so the question that Ilan rightly asked right at the beginning is, we&#8217;re not going to have a customer, what is the exit path? We find something great. &lt;Riiigt&gt; What do we do with it?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the answer &#8212; probably not surprising, given that they appointed an entrepreneur as CEO, an entrepreneur as chair &#8212; is we think the answer is scientific entrepreneurship;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd Ilan&#8217;s answer to this is we need to make sure that the interface between ARIA and the ecosystem &#8212; the entrepreneurial ecosystem &#8212; is really porous in both directions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I agree. Both directions is the keyword.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI love that you guys say “scientific entrepreneurship” because our tagline (I&#8217;ve said this publicly in talks), our two-word phrase at Xerox PARC was “entrepreneurial scientists” &lt;right, right&gt; &#8212; so scientists who are entrepreneurial but are not actually starting startups, &lt;yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd they have this kind of entrepreneurial mindset: There&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re not in academia. There&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re not in industry. They&#8217;re in between. They&#8217;re a really unique interface. So I think that&#8217;s fascinating.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don&#8217;t have to talk about this right now, but just one other quick-quick note is: It&#8217;s also important to make sure process doesn&#8217;t get in the way. Because one piece I edited was Patrick Hsu and Tyler Cowen on the Fast Grants… And, one key insight &#8212; and this obviously came out of the pandemic &#8212; is that sometimes you also have to deploy capital quickly. And sometimes, government process &#8212; and there&#8217;s a good reason for it &#8212; can get in the way of doing that, from allocating funding.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, that&#8217;s been like, that’s been core to how we think about this &#8212; how do we get out of the way? And, you know one of the reasons I think DARPA has succeeded is there&#8217;s very few veto points. &lt;yah yup yup&gt; It&#8217;s not like you have to get 20 people to say yes. &lt;yah&gt; And we do something very similar at Aria. You know, you, the program directors have to convince Ilan, &lt;mhm… yup&gt; basically.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you know, my job as the chair of the board is to scrutinize the whole &#8212; but not get into the weeds, not be another veto point.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s fantastic, I&#8217;m glad you guys are aware of that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo now: Let&#8217;s shift back to the individual; &lt;yah&gt; we&#8217;ve talked about the structural. You said something incredibly fascinating earlier, which is how you&#8217;re obsessed with ambition and this question of ambition… You also said another really beautiful, profound, powerful word, which is “yearning” &#8212; this idea that people have this yearning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the reason that struck me is because when you talk about how you guys are actually trying to support people early in the pipeline to become entrepreneurs &#8212; and know that&#8217;s a path for them &#8212; what really struck me is it&#8217;s fascinating that you even have to do that, that we should even have to do that culturally and societally?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause if you really think about it: Children are born creative, and are\u003Cem\u003E born\u003C\u002Fem\u003E entrepreneurial, you know, X, Y, and Z, or “Let&#8217;s trade on the school thing. Let&#8217;s trade lunches. I&#8217;ll give you two pretzels for one KitKat,&#8221; &#8212; whatever it is. It&#8217;s commerce. Sometimes it&#8217;s about building things together on the playground.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I think there&#8217;s something kind of sad that people lose that… impetus. And one question I have for you from your unique vantage point, at Entrepreneur First, is:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you say you try to get people early, What is a sweet spot when you say earlier in their career; is it right as they&#8217;re in their high school, college, like?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E In London, we have two tracks, and actually the same in Paris &#8212; so we operate in London, in Paris, in Bangalore, and in New York &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the two tracks we have is: We have a track for people as they graduate from university. &lt;Sonal: Yup&gt; And then we have a track for people in (we don&#8217;t put a hard limit on it, but you know) the first five years of their career; so you know, they&#8217;ve got a little bit of work experience but not much. &lt;Oh, got it&gt; I think those two moments are quite special moments &#8212; as well as yearning and ambition; another word we think about a lot is becoming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh, becoming.

It’s really interesting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo what I like about what you&#8217;re saying &#8212; because my question, you&#8217;ve answered it, is very precise, which is: At what point do you kind of intervene, so to speak? &lt;Matt: yah… yah&gt; And what you&#8217;re saying is by doing it in college and the early five years of their first job, that is the how. &lt;Matt: It is the how&gt; Because they have a sense of what.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause my argument was going to be, like, why not do it sooner? &lt;Matt: I mean&#8211; &gt; Like crypto, for instance, we&#8217;re actually seeing highschoolers, &lt;yah, yah&gt; they&#8217;re obsessed. Like, they want to learn. &lt;Yup, yup&gt; And it&#8217;s not for financial reasons. It&#8217;s building. It&#8217;s creativity.

But it&#8217;s like, how can we- how can we sort of provide a peer group that makes people say: Actually, I don&#8217;t want to be a banker. I don&#8217;t want to go be &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; working a 100000-person Big Tech company… And now I&#8217;ve found my people: I&#8217;ve found the people that not only validate that- that sense, but actually can help me get there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You also need, like, support if you&#8217;re struggling with trying to figure something out because you&#8217;re not alone!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And it&#8217;s the feeling that your choices are-are valid.

Because in the U.S., &#8220;The Social Network&#8221; movie was a moment. &lt; Matt: I think it made a huge difference&gt; Right. Like, the Zucks. Because the other thing is this capital gap early on, where people can get angel funding but not like the next phase &#8212; I would argue that&#8217;s a similar thing in the talent game for building a company where you can find like the early employees, but not the people who can scale it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think that&#8217;s still a gap.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s still a gap there?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think it&#8217;s closing, but it&#8217;s closing more slowly, &lt;Sonal: yah… yah… yah&gt; &#8212; because it just takes longer because you need those companies to, to mature and exist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut you know, I think this is also why this like idea of… ambition should be global from day one, like &#8212; Yes, we want this to be a great ecosystem in London, but we&#8217;re not nationalists!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &lt;chuckles&gt; That&#8217;s a great point.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E When I think about EF&#8217;s best companies, the ones that&#8217;s scaling fast, they&#8217;re the ones that have embraced having to be U.S. companies as well as British companies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes.

So what are your views on what&#8217;s working\u002F what&#8217;s not working at a high level? And then, what&#8217;s really changed? &lt;yah&gt; I mean, think about it, it&#8217;s kind of fun that we&#8217;re doing this again after seven years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It is.

We left our jobs in 2011, it took a little bit of iteration for EF to become what it is now. But I remember in 2011, we were like, Maybe this ecosystem is saturated. And just look back now, I&#8217;m like, I think there was like one organization describing itself as a seed fund. When we do demo days today, you know you get like, 2000 people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the ecosystem has grown massively.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that&#8217;s true at like every layer of the stack if you&#8230; I think the talent, we already talked a little bit about how att-attitude as a young talent has changed. But also the proliferation of angel investors, seed funds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the bit that I&#8217;m excited about more recently &#8212; and I guess this is… sort of you guys coming here and opening an office is a good example &lt;yes!&gt; &#8212; is that for a long long time, people talked about, like the capital gap in the UK ecosystem: Yeah, you could raise a seed round, maybe a series A, but you know, series B was really hard. &lt;yess&gt; And there&#8217;s a way to go &#8212; but both in terms of local firms growing up and kind of building reputations and track records &#8212; but also the sort of most famous and storied American firms &lt;right&gt; coming here, I think that&#8217;s a huge net positive for the ecosystem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes, so that&#8217;s more a difference of degree though than kind; &lt;I agree&gt; like, in terms of, you&#8217;re saying, there&#8217;s more investors, more capital available, more people doing things, more entrepreneurs &#8212; would you say there&#8217;s any differences in \u003Cem\u003Ekind\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think the difference in kind I would most point to &#8212; and it&#8217;s going to seem like I&#8217;m obsessed with this theme, but &#8212; is just about ambition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love it. I love that obsession. I&#8217;m on board with that theme.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I remember, when we got started in 2011, one of the things we heard &#8212; and there were some really ambitious startups back then &#8212; In fact, I remember that when we recorded our podcast seven years ago (yah, whenever it was, eight years ago) &lt;I think it wss 8 years ago, 9; who knows at this point!&gt; &#8212; One of my fellow guests on that was Michelle Yu, who&#8217;s one of the founders of Songkick. Now, that was one of the first, like, real first-generation London startups and was super ambitious, but they were unusual. Most 2011 London startups arguably were sort of trying to get bought.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That’s right, that was the exit strategy, not to grow big, and get massive slowly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And that&#8217;s not a criticism of those founders. I think it&#8217;s a lot about what sort of ambition will the ecosystem support. &lt;Sonal: That&#8217;s right&gt; And so the difference of kind I would point out is that I think we now have people who are truly trying to build the global category winner from London, from the UK. &lt;yes!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, we&#8217;re not there yet. It&#8217;s amazing what Daniel has done with Spotify. &lt;yes&gt; In general, we&#8217;re still at the end. There are some really extraordinary European success stories, but you know I think they’re still &#8212; we&#8217;re still sort of pointing to things that happened a little while ago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI do get the sense &#8212; and maybe crypto is an area where this might happen &#8212; where you know you, I do think that 10 years from now we&#8217;ll look back and say, you know, the early 2020s was actually a pretty special time… to build globally ambitious companies from Europe.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m so glad you brought up crypto because when I think of crypto &#8212; this goes back to the earlier point about the positive-sum game and the incentives &#8212; It&#8217;s really about incentive mechanisms and incentive alignment. And that&#8217;s actually the beautiful thing about crypto is it bakes these things in structurally; so there&#8217;s a lot of ways to align different parties of people together to build things. So I kind of agree with you that this could be a very unique time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well I think one of the exciting things about crypto &#8212; from a geographic perspective &#8212; is that it is, it sort of like, natively global. It&#8217;s not one of those things where you look to a domestic market and then expand. &lt;Sonal: That&#8217;s exactly right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd when I think about two of the crypto companies that we&#8217;ve invested in together ( Andreesen Horowitz and Entrepreneur First) &#8212; Gensyn and Aztec &#8212; I think what you see is these are people trying to build infrastructure for a different world, &lt;yes!&gt; But they&#8217;re not building it for London or the UK or for Europe… it is inherently global, &lt;yes&gt; in ambition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E We had MC Lader, COO of Uniswap, on [this podcast], and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fweb3-with-a16z.simplecast.com\u002Fepisodes\u002Fstrategy-operations-organization-uniswap-mc-lader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eshe was saying\u003C\u002Fa\u003E how this is a really unique type of product launch because you&#8217;re instantly global. &lt;yah&gt; Most other times, you used to have, like you&#8217;re saying, these regions, &lt;yah… yah&gt; you would land and expand in this market, then that market, grow in this market. It does not go that way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think it also plays to London&#8217;s strengths in a lot of ways, in that the other thing that I observed… &#8212;  Now, we&#8217;ve been investing in crypto companies at EF for a long time, I think we started the London Bitcoin Meetup in 2014 or something with Imperial College. &lt;Sonal: Oh you did?&gt; One of the things &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen this with probably a better vantage point than almost anyone –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, you know when you go through these hype cycles and then winters, it&#8217;s easy to get discouraged. But one thing that I find so exciting and moving from a talent investor point of view is when I look at like, what are the investments we&#8217;ve made in founders that build in this space that have worked. They&#8217;re actually all- ALL the ones that were just trying to fundamentally build real technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ah! Interesting. As opposed to?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, what I mean is, like, I think, at the height of a boom, you do get a lot of froth. &lt;yah&gt; And I have to say, like, some of that felt pretty extractive, you know. &lt;Sonal: Yeah. Of course, it did. Yeah&gt; But I look at Gensyn, I look at Aztec, and I&#8217;m like, these are engineering-led companies, &lt;Sonal: oh- &gt; You know they&#8217;re building incredibly hard products &#8212; and that&#8217;s what gives them the right to win. &lt;Yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I do think Europe is not that good or hasn&#8217;t been that good at the hype, frankly. In some categories, hype helps a lot… But what I&#8217;m really excited about is like, I think one of the things that we are really good at in London, in the UK: Is like, science and technology. You know, actually doing hard engineering tasks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that for me, when I think about the future of crypto, I think like we just still need a lot of fundamental new technology… to make this work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This is why I’m in the space; this is actually a big reason why I came to the crypto team full time, because of our R&amp;D, and research and development side &#8212; it&#8217;s SO technological, the depth, that expertise &#8212; For those inside, it&#8217;s phenomenally engineering-focused, and I love &lt;Absolutely&gt; that kind of building.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I agree with you; there is, as you said, there&#8217;s always a frothiness in every cycle, and that&#8217;s okay, because sometimes that creates the buzz that then brings the people that then&#8230; &lt;Matt: it crowns in talent, it crowns in capital&gt; Right. And then the few people stay through every cycle and more and more people build. And we&#8217;re in a phase right now where the building and the product, the things that are happening are phenomenal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, my last question for you is, what would you say &#8212; given that this is art, not a science; but I&#8217;m going to make it a little scientific for a moment &#8212; are the qualities that you see that make someone a good entrepreneur. Or what, what kind of- in your talent game, like what is the quote &#8220;formula&#8221; or filter that you use?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I don&#8217;t think there was a formula… but I think that being exceptional is more of a habit than sometimes we admit. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; And… what I look for &#8212; I mean, if I&#8217;m interviewing a 21-year-old who&#8217;s like never worked anywhere, &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; &#8212; and what I&#8217;m always asking is: what have they done?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever unrelated to starting a startup. That they had to do on their own volition &#8212; without anyone telling them &#8212; &lt;yes!&gt; where they went above and beyond… &lt;Sonal yup&gt; and something happened. Like that idea of agency in the world &lt;That’s powerful&gt;, I think, is probably the single most important thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think that&#8217;s a fantastic note to end on. It&#8217;s ambition, yearning, becoming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, I love the line you said about ambition is global &#8212; ‘cause we&#8217;re here in the UK; I&#8217;m from Silicon Valley; but we&#8217;re talking about a global phenomenon. Thank you so much for joining this episode, Matt… It&#8217;s so great to have you back.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatt:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thanks so much for having me

outsourcing computation — and it’s a fast-developing area of technology that could help scale blockchains and, more broadly, decentralize the internet. We explore this world through the lens of zkVMs — or zero-knowledge virtual machines — tools that enable computers to prove that they ran programs correctly, as well as the SNARKs that enable them to work their magic.

I’m Sonal, editor in chief at a16z crypto, and today’s episode is all about how technology has changed art, and how artists change with technology – from the emergence of the browser, the iPhone, and social media to generative art and blockchains to NFTs; \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWe also discuss debates that seem to come up in every art &amp; tech shift &#8212; including between inventing vs. remixing; between commercialism and art; between mainstream canon and outsider art; whether we’re living in an artistic monoculture now; and much much more.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOur special guest is Simon Denny, and we recorded this live in London (a few days after we opened our London office) &#8212; which is fitting since Denny is a global artist, based in Berlin, but has shown his work in various countries’ biennales, museums, and galleries &#8212; including: a metaverse landscapes show called ‘Read Write Own’ at Altman Siegel Gallery in San Francisco last year&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAs a reminder: \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enone of the following is investment, business, legal, or tax advice; please see a16z.com\u002Fdisclosures for more important information, including a link to a list of our investments.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe first half of our hallway-style conversations tours through the evolution of art with technology; and the second half goes deeper into blockchains and art &#8212; but we begin with Denny’s tech journey, and how he thinks of entrepreneurship as an aesthetic!\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Obviously this is a crypto show, and, it&#8217;s also a technology show! &lt;mhm&gt; I mean crypto is all about technology &#8212; one of the reasons I&#8217;m in this world is it&#8217;s a very multidisciplinary field: &lt;yah&gt; It brings together economics; it brings together philosophy; it brings together networking; it brings together security, cryptography… Like there&#8217;s so many layers to crypto? &lt;Simon: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I definitely want to focus in on the art aspect… Tell me a little bit more about your actual practice today, too. And then we’ll go back to the evolution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E At the moment today I work across lots of different media, in lots of different contexts. So, I make both kind of installations for museums and art galleries. I paint as well. But I also am very involved in crypto and crypto art. &lt;yah&gt; So I design NFT projects…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, I guess maybe where I really specialize is I make things that join the museum world with the crypto world &#8212; So, I&#8217;m interested in the history of art and artists who make for new technologies as they emerge, to kind of explore what&#8217;s possible on them that wasn&#8217;t possible on other platforms &lt;exactly&gt; previous.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I personally got really interested in people &#8212; the people who were making the platforms, the people who were designing the systems &#8212; because these were new systems, we were experiencing them; we were feeling different ways, doing different things on them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the first times I encountered entrepreneurial culture, for example, that just inspired me unendingly, right; because it was soo different than the attitude of my artist peers that I encountered. They were bullish about the future. You know in my world at the time (I think it&#8217;s actually different now, but at the time) in my art world &#8212; it was very common to be incredibly critical and cynical &lt;Sonal: right…&gt; cynicism was the go-to. &lt;yah&gt; And I get that culture. I kind of love that culture. It&#8217;s sort of like indie rock or something like that, you know.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then I encountered all these incredible optimists and I was like Wow, this is a force that I can&#8217;t understand culturally, &lt;Sonal: Ohh! That’s fascinating&gt; you know?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I never thought about, that your coming from a cynical, kind of default-cynical art world &#8212; and then being totally inspired by the optimism &lt;Simon: yah&gt; &#8212; ‘cause I feel like those of us in Silicon Valley take that for granted!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, I guess I&#8217;m really attracted to value systems, aesthetically &#8212; because I&#8217;m an artist and I think visually and culturally that I don&#8217;t know everything about and I don&#8217;t completely understand, you know?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I started to go to technology conferences. And the first thing that I did is I went to a prominent conference in Munich called DLD. And I made an artwork about DLD in 2013 &#8212; a one-year history of the conference a year later &#8212; I made a maze that people would walk through in this museum space (just down the road from the conference) &lt;mhm&gt;, where there was a graphic panel for every talk panel, basically. &lt;Sonal: interesting&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you would look at pool courts that I pulled out from the entire conference and encounter things that Jack Dorsey was saying, &lt;yah&gt; things that the founder of Wikipedia was saying, Pavel Durov was saying &#8212; like, interesting entrepreneurs that they were able to kind of gather there &#8212; and the things they were saying about the world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it was kind of overwhelming…&lt;Sonal: Sounds really immersive, too&gt; It was super immersive, but very digital; I also leaned into the design interfaces that were contemporary at the time &#8212; which look really ancient now, &lt;yah&gt; which is really interesting, too &lt;mhm&gt; &#8212; Because it was like iOS when it was skeuomorphism &lt;right&gt;: So it was like all of these kind of bookshelves as stages, as whatever digital buttons; and there was the kind of graphic language I used, it was like cartoon font &lt;yah&gt; that looks very strange –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it gave us overall sense of this really vibrant community, which I hadn&#8217;t really encountered before as an artist. Again: the art world&#8217;s a little different in terms of culture, and that was one of the first times that I was like, Wow, this is incredible. There are people here who are really optimistic, super excited about the future. Yes, they&#8217;re critical thinkers as well, but they really want to build something.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that was the first time I encountered that culture.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Tell me a little bit about how you actually came as an artist to the technology world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So yah; I grew up in New Zealand; I went to university at the University of Auckland to first study art &#8212; like that was the thing that I fell in love with as a painter when I was younger –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENew Zealand’s amazing but it&#8217;s also very small, &lt;yah&gt; and quite remote. And I learned about how big the kind of contemporary art world was, which made me want to go study in Germany. Germany is a really special country for contemporary art: Every little town has a major contemporary art museum &#8212; which is really unusual &#8212; in the post-war period, it&#8217;s been a really important place for lots of different artists internationally to kind of do museum shows early.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s also an incredible education system there; So I went to art school then in Frankfurt at this very special school called the Städelschule in the mid-2000s. And at that time, the director of the school was also the director of the Venice Biennale &lt;Sonal: oh, wow!&gt; and, all the teachers that I was learning from there were these international artists that I saw on the cover of all the magazines that I was reading. So, it was a really exciting hub of international practice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd there I got super interested in the history of technology and art &lt;yah&gt; &#8212; because: I moved there in 2007, the year the iPhone came out.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, like, I moved with a laptop &#8212; didn&#8217;t have an iPhone, because it was a brand-new, very expensive thing &#8212; but we were all just starting to use social media (like Web 2) in a really interesting way. And of course because I moved away from all my friends and family, that was one of the things that really kept me connected: Laptop I used for education, watching movies; but also keeping on top of friends in a really intense way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so a bunch of artists that were studying at that time got really interested in this new wave of like technological stuff that was enabling a different type of engagement. And Berlin&#8217;s a &#8212; for those who don&#8217;t know Germany &#8212; Berlin&#8217;s like, I guess, a place where a lot of contemporary artists live and work. And there were like this little hub of people that were really interested in the history of contemporary art &#8212; the history of art made for digital platforms &#8212; like web art from the 1990s, which is a very interesting specialist field: So, when browsers came about, when the worldwide web started, when people started using Mosaic &lt;chuckles&gt; &lt;yah!!&gt; and Netscape, there were artists designing for that as a specific medium.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes! I want to go back to how, when you were in art school, you and your cohort came across the iPhone for the first time. &lt;Simon: Oh my god&gt; And you don&#8217;t necessarily immediately think it viscerally about the iPhone as a creative medium, the way one thinks about caves for cave painting, &lt;right&gt; or paper for drawing, or canvas for painting, &lt;yah&gt; or… LED lights, electronic art installations at mass scale or whatever; neon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s funny that you mentioned that &#8212; because it&#8217;s just sort of like this little tiny&#8230;like, it&#8217;s a device, it&#8217;s a computing device &lt;right&gt; &#8212; So can you tell me a little bit about how you and your cohort at the time experienced the advent of the iPhone as the moment that tipped into your interest, in the intersection of technology and art?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, I think it was a conflation of a few different things that I was really compelled by when the iPhone came out. One was like the really strong marketing component to that. &lt;yeh&gt; I think I was particularly impressed by that. Like the Steve Jobs moment was very compelling.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The narrative part of it?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The narrative part of that; you know like the way that Steve and other entrepreneurs around him at the time seemed to be offering a really cohesive vision of the world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut also the aesthetics; it was kind of a design hegemony that got installed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut also, as a person who was like looking at the history of artists designing for particular mediums &#8212; you could do stuff with mobile and social that you couldn&#8217;t do before. Right? Artists had been making amazing artworks for browsers; there&#8217;s an incredible history of that. They&#8217;d even been making artworks that dealt with the culture of companies: There was an amazing browser-based group in the &#8217;90s who were called “etoy”. &lt;oh!&gt; And etoy was a real company, &lt;Sonal: right, I remember that actually&gt; and etoy started before e-toys.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut they tended to be quite antagonistic. A lot of browser-based work from the &#8217;90s came from artists who were really resistant to the commercial aspects of the internet &#8212; they were really anti-commerce?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E They were, sort of, purists about the internet for just communication.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly; and I think they really idealized moments where it was a more collective experience, and the commercial part seemed to be a difficult thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut Etoy I think was an amazing collective because they were completely anonymous, and they basically ended up coordinating a DDoS attack on Etoy, the real company;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s like activist art in some ways… right.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly; activist art was really close to that browser-based work. &lt;Sonal: right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow me and my cohort were less anti-, right? Like I&#8217;d come up already through a commercial art world that was offline; I really valued the work that commercial agents were doing &lt;right&gt; to like make the work known… and I didn&#8217;t have a problem with that. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think a lot of the people who were using social media, early, were also okay with the idea of promoting themselves…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, we were less against. We designed things that didn&#8217;t necessarily have this kind of anti-commercial message.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, There&#8217;s always been this long history and tension, as you obviously know, &lt;yah&gt; with artists and the commercial aspect. I mean Andy Warhol’s the most obvious, &lt;exactly&gt; example that comes to mind for that. And it&#8217;s interesting because we&#8217;ll get to how this may play out with the NFT world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou talked about the early days of Web2, browser-based art as maybe the moment in your age and demographic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s like Web1 art in a way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Web1: browser-based; Web2: &lt;Simon: Social&gt; Some of this Instagram\u002F social and mobile.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One of the greatest examples, I think, of people making artwork for social media + mobile was this work that a friend of mine, Amalia Ulman, did &#8212; a little bit later like in the early 2010s &lt;yah&gt; &#8212; And this is when Instagram was really the medium that everybody was using in the art world (at least, in our art world).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we were all posting our exhibition photos on there, posting selfies of ourselves, &lt;yah&gt; whatever &#8212; but she was using it in a different way where she really occupied this proto-influencer idiom. She started taking photos of her, and then gradually over time like her image changed. It was less art-world girl, more kind of like “basic” quote-unquote-looking person: Like you know her makeup was more extreme. Her body became more extreme. And then at one point, she was announcing that she was going to have surgery on her body &lt;Sonal: whoa…&gt; You know?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then we, as a community of artists that knew her, were like Wow, Amalia&#8217;s really changed; like this is like really super difficult… And then she had these incredible pre- and post-things of an operation or whatever. &lt;yahh!&gt; And then it came out that it was all a performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we were all completely duped by the whole thing &#8212; it was really, really believable &#8212; &lt;uh-huh&gt; and, again, it used all of these emergent properties of that medium &lt;yah&gt; to really do something that said something about the way that the world was going.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes! That sounds like performance art… &lt;Simon: It is performance art!&gt; I actually think I heard about this. &lt;yah!&gt; Right, exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd speaking of the specific properties of that medium &#8212; you also mentioned the word “proto-influencer” &lt;mhm&gt; which I think is very interesting &#8212; because obviously, there is this element of influencers today on Instagram and in social media, and influencer culture.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this is sort of pre that sort of phase?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It was emergent with it, I would say, you know?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Emergent with it? Okay.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And I think this is what artists are good at doing. They&#8217;re good at seeing emergent properties that are happening &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; &#8212; both in visual conventions like how photos are looking, because that was another thing &#8212; Like visually, there was a particular style to these images: it came from the hardware, came from the way that the phone looked, came from the lighting that was common in a bedroom &lt;Sonal: ah, right!&gt; or whatever…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of this also was, kind of, an aesthetic layer to it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes, yes; it was also constrained by the technology at the time, right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And all of those things come together to make a particular medium possible, including the network &#8212; &lt;yah&gt; right, which I think is also interesting if we&#8217;re thinking in the future about NFTs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E When you say the “network”, do you mean the network as in the community &lt;yah&gt; around her, or the network of her followers and her social graph &#8212; or what do you mean by network?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think there&#8217;s a few different layers to the network thing. &lt;yah&gt; The performance (if you categorize it as a performance piece), happened kind of first to her friends that knew her &#8212; because the strangeness of experiencing that change was the thing that made the affect, right.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that network of friends also had a second-order network of people that knew of her &#8211;So this kind of classic social network\u002F kind of social-graph world it kind of spread out into.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut also the hardware: The technological layer of the network where you couldn&#8217;t have these distributed, perfomative moments &#8212; without iPhones, without satellites, without cables …So, it&#8217;s really quite a lot of things coming together &lt;right&gt; in this network, I think.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Interesting. So then Simon, on that note, what are some of the other milestones for your experience and evolution as an artist in the technological… &lt;yah&gt; moments?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, artists have been dealing with technological changes, and expressing the visceral feelings of inhabiting new technological moments for a very long time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESurrealism and Dada as an early 20th century moment that dealt a lot with the changes, both in advertising language &lt;ah!&gt; and mediums around communication: Surrealism really leaned into the illustrative aspect of that. But like Dada and stuff &#8212; artists like Picabia and people making images of machines, of post-industrial revolution kind of worlds &#8212; a lot of early modernism is depicting machinic worlds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you then jump, let&#8217;s say to the post-war period in the 1960s and &#8217;70s, you started to have groups of artists around pop art and neo-pop &#8212; dealing again with the language of advertising and ambivalence toward commercial culture &lt;right&gt; &#8212; Artists like Robert Rauschenberg, who was a kind of proto-pop artist, working with people like in collectives like E.A.T. like the Experiments in Art and Technology, which happened in dialogue with Bell Labs at the time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh, I didn&#8217;t know about that. &lt;Simon: yah yah&gt; Tell me a little bit more about that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean I&#8217;m not an expert, but there was this really amazing moment where these very prominent people were in dialogue with people in Bell Labs. And so they made experimental, technologically-enabled sculptures.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was one Rauschenberg piece that I&#8217;m thinking of actually (I don&#8217;t know if he made it in E.A.T. or not) &#8212; but it was like a bed of mud that was bubbling, that then had a kind of like a sensory component on it as well. Like, really amazing kind of machine and kind of object-based work &#8212; but also a lot of theater-based experiments and performances, which were also done with early computer systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was also people being given, for example, early Porta-Paks &#8212; which was the first kind of video equipment, by Sony &#8212; So Sony was donating to artist groups, and there was an artist group that was in New York that was really adjacent to the Whole Earth Catalog and the Stewart Brand world, &lt;Sonal: yes, yes&gt; right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was another magazine called Radical Software, which was produced at the time as well &#8212; and Radical Software was run by an early artist corporation, called RainDance Corporation; they incorporated themselves &lt;Sonal: yah;)&gt; &#8212; and they had a space in New York where several Porta-Paks were that artists could come and use. They would make footage, they would bring the footage back. And then they would make artist libraries that you could pull as stock footage &lt;whoa&gt; and make montages from &#8212; that was also a really interesting early moment that inspired me a lot.&lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd out of that group came early experiments in broadcast television and cable network television. There was an amazing collective called Top Value Television, and they for example produced one of the most amazing artist-made documentaries that was then screened on cable television at the time &#8212; looking at Madison Avenue and advertising producers. But also a Nixon convention; they went and made a political documentary. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then of course, there&#8217;s more famous examples like Warhol television and stuff like that &lt;of course&gt; and cable networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E When you said that the example of the early stock library type of idea &lt;yah!&gt; that people could take, and you said that inspired your work. &lt;mhm&gt; What really stuck in my mind about that is that&#8217;s like an analog version of remix culture. &lt;Simon: Absolutely&gt; And so tell me about how it inspired your work, specifically.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, I&#8217;m a bit of a historian and I actually made a show here in London in 2012 at the Institute of Contemporary Art (the ICA) &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere, I managed to convince the broadcasting network who were changing over from analog broadcasting to digital to give us one of the old analog broadcasting machines. &lt;mhm&gt; And I dumped that in the middle of the Institute for Contemporary Art, and put all of these libraries of old network videos (made by people like Randon&#8217;s Corporation and their peers) around in a video library where people could watch them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one of the things that I found in an archive of theirs was a way of categorizing different types of tapes. They made early data versions representing what was being made in those libraries. So, I found those resonant with what people were doing on YouTube, what other artists, peers of mine were making which were kind of remixed things and appropriated things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA bunch of my work is very liberal with ownership &#8212; I believe that one doesn&#8217;t invent something; I believe that one finds things and combines them with things. So I prefer the notion of like “a value add”, than a kind of invention.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I don&#8217;t believe that you can invent things. This is why I think movements like pop art were so profound? Because the direct appropriative touch of making an image of a Campbell&#8217;s soup can &lt;yah&gt; and claiming that as an original thing, &lt;yup&gt; recontextualizing it was one of the biggest things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think sampling culture and all of that stuff like builds like on the back of that assumption.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I find that so personally fascinating, too. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo we talked about some of the pre-influences &lt;mhm&gt; in the technological side. Let&#8217;s talk about some of the post-influences, &lt;yah, yah&gt; post-iPhone. Are there any other technological moments?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, so I think the next big moment: In the mid-2010s, I was lucky enough to do the Venice Biennale Pavilion for New Zealand. The Venice Biennale is kind of like the biggest art show in the world, and there&#8217;s country-by-country pavilions. So, I got to do New Zealand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in order to do that &#8212; it was 2013, &#8217;14, I was working on it; and &#8217;15 I presented it &#8212; I was interested in the WikiLeaks moment at that time. Artists like Trevor Paglen were involved in those communities, so I was sort of peripherally aware of those groups &#8212; around transparency and stuff like that &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E By the way, I was at WIRED at that time, &lt;there you go!&gt; when that was playing out. Keep going.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E When they released all these documents, I found the kind of like clip art on the internal NSA documents, I found them really aesthetically surprising. &lt;wow!&gt; They were these very playful images that were representing kinda very serious things. &lt;Sonal: That&#8217;s so interesting, I never thought about that!&gt; You had literally like a magic card standing in for a big offensive that was kind of looking in on everybody&#8217;s privacy or whatever.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I was so interested that I really wanted to find some concrete example of who was making those images. Who were those artists, right? &lt;Sonal: right&gt; And I found this one guy&#8217;s LinkedIn page, this guy called David Darchicourt. And David Darchicourt &#8212; was self-proclaimed on his LinkedIn; this is, again, social media art in a way &#8212; he claimed that he was the creative director of the NSA, for the 20 years preceding the leaks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd he had a really big Adobe platform portfolio with his work on it as well; so he had designs he&#8217;d done for the NSA, slip mats, mousepads, &lt;right!; chuckles&gt; training posters, all these things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I made copies of all of them… &lt;okay&gt; I made giant interpretations of his work. I changed medium from them. So, I made kind of sculptures out of things that were diagrams. &lt;wowww&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I situated them in this library &#8212; right in the middle of Venice, next to the Doge&#8217;s Palace  (which was designed by Sansovino, this very important architect then) &#8212; And, that is a very ornate room that has images of druids and wizards and all these fantasy things that went into Tintoretto and all these artists that were working in that period. &lt;right&gt; …And I put his work alongside their work &#8212; and there were these crazy synergies: bearded men, strange books…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFantasy imagery that was throughout the NSA material, in clip art form, was very close and resonant with these kind of like Renaissance images, you know &lt;right!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, I guess the key thing was it was a performative piece &#8212; because Darchicourt didn&#8217;t know that I did this work &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I was about to ask you if he knew, and if you talked to him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E No… So it was all appropriated, and the only moment that he found out that that happened was when The Guardian called him on the opening day &lt;laughs&gt; and said, Hey, did you know there&#8217;s a bunch of stuff with your work?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What did he react by the way?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think he was a little confused.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &lt;laughs&gt; He&#8217;s like, What is this guy doing with this? &lt;chuckles&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah I mean it was really important to him at the time &#8212; and this came out in The Guardian article too (when The Guardian spoke to him) &#8212; it was really important that he was attributed, which he was; His phone number was on there just like it was on the web. That was part of my gesture. &lt;Yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think he found it was interesting of course as the gesture was a little bit like performing something like what the NSA was performing on all of us &lt;right, right&gt; &#8212; but on an artistic work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that was again complicated by the fact that I was from New Zealand. This is U.S. culture in a certain sense. So I think there was a lot of really interesting tensions around ownership.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right. And it’s funny, the technological underpinnings are fascinating to me &lt;mhm&gt; because you said briefly that, in a way, him putting that he was a creative director for the NSA on his LinkedIn profile &lt;yah&gt; is almost performance art. &lt;Simon: Exactly&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the other point is that these materials you&#8217;re talking about, these artifacts were leaked online.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah. And I think this brings up the kind of art networks that preserve and take care of culture &#8212; I think they take care of things that are otherwise not seen, and not cared for.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I really like to act in that domain. But of course, that&#8217;s a sort of object-based medium in itself &#8212; you want to go into a room in a museum, and you want to have a to have a rich experience in there &#8212; translating browser-based work into a projector in a room doesn&#8217;t always work so well, right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right… Did you create it for the Biennale?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I created it for the Biennale. The way that it works, you get commissioned. You can kind of do whatever you like, you work with a curator. The government of the country sponsors that, and then the Biennale kind of acts as a presenter in a way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E By the way, one more note, you mentioned a couple times that you&#8217;re from New Zealand, &lt;yah&gt; and you were- in this Biennale, you were representing New Zealand&#8217;s pavilion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you think that influenced your work? Because you live in Berlin today; &lt;right&gt; we&#8217;re recording this as we speak in London; you presented your work in a show in San Francisco, and you&#8217;re very global.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I am curious about &#8212; I have a question here, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m leading up to this &#8212; how being a New Zealander influences your art; do you think there&#8217;s any kind of influence there?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I do, and I think it&#8217;s quite a deep one, actually &lt;Okay!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I grew up in New Zealand, but all of my ancestors did things which I find complicated and difficult. And while I grew up in a place where I felt a kind of a homeliness too, I also always felt like it wasn&#8217;t really totally my home. &lt;right&gt; And I was always a part of a kind of a global world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that was honestly one of the reasons why I was viscerally attracted to global community, you know “found” community; the internet as a kind of a tool for challenging the notion of a nation-state as a body, as an identity. I very strongly identify to that. I feel more connected to the people that I work with around the world than I do to one particular location.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s fascinating…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, it&#8217;s funny, the reason I mentioned it, too, is my first time at Art Basel was 2006.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Same. &lt;laughs&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh, you too? Same year? Oh fun!! I wonder if we crossed each other&#8217;s paths. You never know; I always think of sliding door moments. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it&#8217;s funny because that was a year that Marc Newson was named Designer of The Year. And it was also right about when Art Basel had finally &#8212; it&#8217;s been established for a number of years &#8212; but it started now to finally hit the mainstream awareness. I remember this because I was behind Vanity Fair who was covering it for the first time &lt;right, right&gt; when they were touring the floor &#8212; they were on a tour that the Art Basel group had actually curated and I was like on one of the tours with them. &lt;Amazing&gt; (I wasn&#8217;t working for them or anything; I just happened to sign up for that time slot. So, that&#8217;s why I got to follow and hear; so it was very interesting that year.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was also the year that they started to&#8230;you know how now like Art Basel is all about the satellite fairs and everything that surrounds it locally &#8212; which is amazing because it spawned millions of other fairs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Particularly in Miami.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh-especially in Miami. I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m speaking specifically of Art Basel Miami. Exactly. Now they have NADA, and they have all these other things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut at the time, they started Design Miami, &lt;yah&gt; and they gave Marc Newson Designer of The Year. &lt;right&gt; He’s like a sculptor essentially; the famous Lockheed Lounge chairs&#8230; and then obviously people might think of him in a tech sense because he was good friends with Jony Ive’s and so there was some collaboration there on the technology side. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd he&#8217;s Australian. &lt;right&gt; And he said something that really blew my mind, which is that he felt that, growing up in Australia, &lt;mhm&gt; he was liberated as an artist because he didn&#8217;t have the legacy and influences that one would have if you grew up in a place like Italy &#8212; where you have like Renaissance history; or you&#8217;re surrounded by all these like sculptures that were created like thousands of years ago. &lt;mm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo he felt that he had almost an unopinionated journey to art &lt;hmm&gt; &#8212; and a lens on it that… it almost gave him a more neutral palette growing up in a place like that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich is why I asked about New Zealand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s so interesting. I mean, I would frame it slightly differently. &lt;Sonal: Great. I want to hear it.&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that there was definitely a weight of the situation and the history &lt;ah… yes&gt; that was definitely there &#8212; but it wasn&#8217;t of course the same one as the kind of canon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, in a parallel way, you have this other influence of indigenous culture playing out at the same time. &lt;right&gt; So I remember one of my key inspiration moments when I was learning art at the first time at the University of Auckland &#8212; I had this incredible professor, Michael Parekowhai, and he is an incredible sculptor; grew up in a Maori context &#8212; but he was making work that resonated with &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s pop artists like Jeff Koons. He was making big shiny things that used the language of advertising that also spoke to indigeneity &lt;yah… right&gt; in New Zealand at the time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that was actually drawing from a canon &#8212; but also kind of coming from a place which had other information to bring to that canon. &lt;right!&gt; You know what I mean? &lt;totally&gt; I think that&#8217;s the thing that I was really inspired by.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so then going back now to the moment at the Venice Biennale, &lt;yah&gt; when you did that WikiLeaks moment, &lt;ok…yah&gt; were there any other technology milestones &lt;yah yah&gt; on the way to crypto and blockchain art?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;ll say one more. So I mentioned this piece that I made where I was looking at entrepreneurs through DLD, through going and hanging out at conferences; that was really inspiring aesthetically and everything for me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s so funny to hear about entrepreneurship as an “aesthetic”. &lt;chuckles&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, I love it. So this is the thing: I leaned into the Berlin of that time as well. And I made a series of works about young startups.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo for example, I took a WIRED Roundup like top 10 startups in Berlin, and I made almost like a deal toy, meets a gaming computer, meets a piece that might go in a trade fair booth or something like that. &lt;right!&gt; And I would make these pop-art-inspired sculptures that were celebrating the culture of entrepreneurship.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was something that I ended up culminating in a big show that I did also in 2015 at MOMA PS1, which was called the innovator&#8217;s dilemma. It was like named after&#8211;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Clayton Christensen&#8217;s famous book.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8212; Exactly, Clayton Christensen book; where it kind of brought together a bunch of different projects that are doing in general about entrepreneurship.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI made something about South Korean entrepreneurship. I made a big project about Samsung during those years as well, which looked at their turn to be more global in the 1990s. &lt;right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI also did a really big round of work based on Peter Thiel. It was inspired by a moment in New Zealand where it was realized that Thiel was a citizen. And I made like a big group of artworks that were based on board-gaming and the language of gaming &#8212; &lt;right&gt; which mapped out ideological narratives that came from Peter&#8217;s world &#8212; which is very, very influential in entrepreneurship.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I did a show that was at a small gallery in Auckland in New Zealand, not a kind of big space; but Peter ended up coming there. He ended up seeing the show. We ended up getting in touch after that (when he was still based in San Francisco). And that was, again, this really interesting moment of bringing the way that certain ideas were received in the local space &#8212; with something that was very influential in the business world and the technology world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI also made artworks about Kim Dotcom &#8212; who was this German-Finnish entrepreneur who built a platform called Megaupload &#8212; which was one of the most-used piracy network things for downloading Hollywood content. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd he was sued by the U.S. government (I think in 2013, 2012 even maybe?), and there was a massive bust on his home &#8212; which was a collaboration between the New Zealand armed forces, and police network, and the U.S. &#8212; and they tried to extradite him ever since.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Of course.

I edited one of my friends&#8230; She&#8217;s also an author, Virginia Postrel. She wrote a book called \u003Cem\u003EGlamour\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, which actually&#8230; It&#8217;s funny to use the word glamor because it has certain specific connotations to it, which I think is great. &lt;right right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I do have to ask you, Simon, like do you think there&#8217;s also this kind of… monoculture that&#8217;s happening because of that globalization, and in that aesthetic?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause I feel &#8212; especially in the case of pixel art &lt;mhm&gt; &#8212; that there was a point when everyone got a little too digitally influenced &lt;Simon: yah, chuckles&gt; and everything started looking like the 8-bit thing. &lt;right&gt; And I got very bored of that aesthetic. &lt;yah yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so I just wonder if you think there&#8217;s this sort of homogenization happening as well &lt;sure&gt; in the aesthetic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, I guess this is a narrative that comes up from time to time; I mean, it&#8217;s not only in art that it comes up, right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right.

Right? &lt;yesss&gt; There is no such thing &#8212; again this is another originality question &#8212; there&#8217;s no such thing as a true original flavor of X or Y.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s no first anything, and there&#8217;s only kind of encounters.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I tend to think &#8212; I&#8217;m sort of like an “encounters maximalist” or something like that &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I like that, an “encounters maximalist”!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, that&#8217;s something I literally just coined &lt;Sonal: I love it; we&#8217;re inventing things on the podcast; that&#8217;s how we roll.&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBUT, I tend to think that more hybridization is always positive, and I don&#8217;t believe that this true homogenization really ever happens.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are kind of trends, and moments, where certain “boringnesses” settle into a market or whatever &lt;right&gt; where a lot of people try and do that thing. And yes, I get very bored about that very quickly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBoring homogenous stuff is boring and homogenous, and I think the way that NFTs stratified very quickly in 2021 into particular genres bored the hell out of me.

I also think globalization is a much older story than is often assumed colloquially; cultures have been mixing across Eurasia for example, for very long times…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh, totally; I love that you pointed out that this kind of intermixing has been happening for like, eons.

And those things I found often a little less interesting, you know what I mean, uh?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes, I totally agree.

And that was three different fictional trade fair booths, based on three different entrepreneurs, that were looking at three different narratives that were emerging from blockchain: One of them was Blythe Masters. So, Blythe Masters was coming from the banking world, right? She came out of securities in the 1990s, and she made this company at the time called Digital Asset &lt;okay&gt;; I made a big kind of installation about her. I made a big installation about Balaji and about 21 [dot] Inc before it was changed or whatever. &lt;right&gt; And then I made a big one about Ethereum and Vitalik. &lt;oh wow&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it was like those three narratives that I was kind of looking at the same time. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI made little postage stamps that I worked on with the German postal &#8212; because I thought postage stamps were \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C\u002Fem\u003E expressions of sovereignty, right &lt;uh-huh&gt;; they were also design objects; and they were also kind of a currency, like a parallel currency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What&#8217;s also by the way fascinating about postal stamps is that they are an expression of sovereignty &#8212; but they&#8217;re also like ways to get out: They move objects around the world, too… so fascinating.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly &#8212; they’re infrastructure. &lt;Right, exactly &gt; So I thought they were the perfect sculptural form for work about this emergent network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So far you described how you were using blockchain and crypto &lt;mhm&gt; as inspiration for your art, &lt;yah, yah…&gt; the subject matter of your art;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut now blockchain as a medium, let&#8217;s talk about that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. So there were a few people at that time who were starting to design kind of web-based art &#8212; like browser art that I described earlier or Web2 art, let&#8217;s say &lt;yup&gt; &#8212; that was based on coding on emergent blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there was a project called Ascribe &#8212; which was actually something Vitalik worked on as well at the time &#8212; which was an early system that tried to put artworks and link them to the Bitcoin network. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a conference in 2014 at Seven on Seven that Rhizome did &lt;mhm&gt; &#8212; which was connected to the New Museum &#8212; where they pair an artist with a technologist. &lt;okay!&gt; And at the time, they designed something based on colored coin[s], which was essentially an NFT.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I started to kind of learn about other projects… I&#8217;d learned about terra0, which was a really interesting project, which was a group that were proposing to make trees own themselves as entities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Trees own themselves! Wow!!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah exactly- They were like look, if you can do a blockchain system based on Ethereum, if you can have smart contracts, then why not give the sovereignty of ownership to the trees? Why not have a commercial forest own the produce of its own work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was fascinated by that. So I curated a little show in 2018 at a space in Berlin called The Schinkel Pavillon. And that was about artists that were doing these experiments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso included in that was Cryptokitties. &lt;okay&gt; I don&#8217;t know if you remember this, but Christie&#8217;s did a weird little collaboration with Consensys where they sold a hardware wallet with a specially designed CryptoKitty on it. Where Guile Twardowski &#8212; who was the guy who invented the visual aspect of the CryptoKitties projects and not the kind of mechanics, but the actual cats &lt;the aesthetic, yah&gt; &#8212; made a special one and they sold it as a hardware wallet, which was also specially designed, &lt;right&gt; in an auction. And it was like big news in the New York Times.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so I included that in the show. I included terra0, this forest project in the show. I included other artists like Kei Kreutler, &lt;yes… yes&gt; who was also working at Gnosis at the time doing interesting designs for that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the whole show was set up &#8212; the curatorial premise &#8212; was also based on blockchains because I didn&#8217;t want to decide everybody in the show. I asked somebody else to choose two things, and then they would choose two things. &lt;yah yah&gt; And then we did a transparent publishing of all of the decision-makers on the wall as a curatorial protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So you turned curation &#8212; the act and art of curation itself &#8212; into a form of art &lt;yes&gt;… that actually also showed the process behind the outcomes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly; transparency, networks &#8212; all of these things that are kind of so important to blockchain. &lt;fascinating&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized decision-making, right? And so, yeah, we had this kind of protocol that we designed where everybody knew who picked them for being in the show, and I wasn&#8217;t making all the decisions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that show was called Proof of Work… But that was way before NFTs were a thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes. And before we talk more about NFTs, &lt;yah&gt; what do you think is unique about blockchains as a medium for art?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Mmm… You know, one of the interesting things about blockchain as a medium, I think, is that the cultural asset and the financial container is the same thing &lt;yah&gt; Right? That&#8217;s sort of true in art, in a way… but literally, as an NFT, those things are much more structurally combined, right? &lt;right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd Web2 art, and like art designed for social networks, they also are like networked objects; they&#8217;re connected to other things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd settlement is immediate, right? I mean, one of the things that artists got really, really excited about with the emergence of blockchain art &#8212; and this is really going into the NFT moment now &#8212; but the idea that you could have settlement immediately on sale &lt;mhm&gt;. And that you wouldn&#8217;t have to have an intermediary &#8212; because you know gallerists and whatever, it&#8217;s a very complicated system. &lt;yes!&gt; &#8212; so the simplicity and the directness of that was really attractive.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut also this notion of resale royalties, the idea that you would sell something on a secondary market and immediately the original creator would receive some compensation for that? That&#8217;s been something that the art world&#8217;s been dreaming about since the 70s; there&#8217;s a conceptual art piece by a very famous curator, Seth Siegelaub, that he did in the early 1970s, called The Artist Contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So let&#8217;s talk about about NFTs, specifically. &lt;mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo we&#8217;ve obviously been dancing around that this entire conversation &lt;right&gt;, but I think crypto art is bigger than just NFTs, to be clear. &lt;Right, agreed&gt; And blockchains as a medium is bigger than just NFTs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right. Agreed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So we agree on that… But let&#8217;s talk about NFTs, specifically, because that&#8217;s the thing that really captured the mainstream attention &#8212; and actually maybe even catapulted crypto into much more mainstream awareness.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd to be clear, I mean this well beyond the financialization aspects &lt;Simon: No, no, totally; yah&gt; I&#8217;m talking about it as an artistic thing: This includes multiple auction houses, like doing NFT auctions, &lt;yah&gt; like participating in it. Multiple people who only came to crypto for the first time and set up a wallet in order to buy NFTs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike who knew? Of course, we knew that culture &lt;well- &gt; would be the thing that brings people to technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean retroactively, it looks logical, but I don&#8217;t think that was a given, you know.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh interesting, tell me why.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, I don&#8217;t know. I mean, I think the moment that changed for me from knowing about a small group of people messing around with blockchains, &lt;yes, yes&gt; making art with it, to like the post-Beeple auction moment. I guess that&#8217;s maybe like the&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Beeple is the right thing. Pre- and post-Beeple. BB and PB. Yeah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right, exactly. And that was also in cahoots with the auction houses; I mean Beeple was not an unknown entity before that auction, but he was known in the graphic arts world, right, like he was a very, very well-known figure there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then with the signal from the blue-chip art world &#8212; you know, from those auction houses &#8212; I think those are the things that kind of created that change in awareness.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, say more &#8212; like why you think it wasn&#8217;t a given that this would happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well if I think back to Web2 for example, I don&#8217;t think culture was the thing that kind of like brought that into like mainstream awareness and usage. &lt;Ah!&gt; I mean, unless you count kind of “sociality” as a layer of culture, which I guess one could, &lt;yah yah yah&gt; and I guess I do in a way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it&#8217;s not high culture. Like you didn&#8217;t learn about Facebook or MySpace because of an Exponent Art &#8212; whereas I think a lot of people&#8217;s mainstream adoption and understanding of web3 came around that moment which was associated with art and an artist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWeb1 also didn&#8217;t happen like that: You know, you didn&#8217;t hear about the internet because you heard of some artist piece being made by an artist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E No I agree; I totally agree with you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou&#8217;ve said multiple times throughout this conversation that culture emerges. &lt;mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so what do you think about this moment made this like the time &#8212; like why now?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well I mean, I think auction houses are always looking for new things, new markets. They&#8217;ve constantly done that. You know before the 1970s and 80s, they didn&#8217;t sell contemporary art, for example; they only sold old masters. &lt;yup&gt; So moving into new areas is kind of like a textbook thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then Defi Summer came… And there was all this liquidity created in the ecosystem from people who&#8217;d been successful, which then they started to filter into these cultural assets, &lt;yes&gt; right? And I think that was what built up to the crypto moment we&#8217;re talking about.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes but why the art? Because they could have also funneled that liquidity to something else.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know, I can&#8217;t answer that question. &lt;yah&gt; But I think I think people want to buy art that support the cultures that they believe in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s about identity and belonging and affiliation. &lt;Simon: Yeah, exactly&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And people who had been excited by what was possible within this DeFi world, within the kind of crypto world in general, saw an emergent cultural package that that kind of embodied the value of that &#8212; and they were like, okay, I believe in this culturally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that mostly really happened around PFPs…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes, like profile-pic type art…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Profile-pic type art &#8212; like CryptoKitties and CryptoPunks &#8212; Artistically, it&#8217;s really an interesting mechanism:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou sell something, initially, to a large community; a bunch of people hold the same thing. &lt;yup&gt; And then, that also moves around in networks; it changes ownership, owner to owner, right? And with that, the community grows, the people who have touched that asset. &lt;yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that means that a large group of people are suddenly almost fractal participators in kind of one cultural moment, &lt;totally!&gt; right, one cultural asset. You know what I mean? &lt;yes, exactly!&gt; They&#8217;re designed to participate in networks that the provenance is important: You know where it came from, where it&#8217;s going to &lt;yes… yes…yes&gt;; tracing these relationships as a part of the medium &lt;right!&gt; is what&#8217;s so super interesting about that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It’s fascinating. And the networks themselves are in the cloud &lt;yah&gt;, or blockchain &#8212;  One of our colleagues, Tim Roughgarden, calls blockchains “computers in the sky” &lt;yah&gt;&#8211; because they operate without any central intermediary, they&#8217;re accessible to all &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou talked earlier about coming from New Zealand, and this idea of the borders and the inspiration for you being almost global by default &#8212; &lt;yah yah… exactly, exactly&gt; this is that exact very example &#8212; like the portability of the asset, it&#8217;s not just that: It&#8217;s like the portability of your humanity, your identity, like who you are, your network… Or even belonging in a network, regardless of border\u002F place\u002F location, into a different kind of identity online.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah. And I mean there&#8217;s a sort of more humanities side to this argument as well, like you know the Donna Haraway notion of the “community of kin”. But it&#8217;s that within a digitally designed kind of artwork-network… I mean that’s so- beautiful.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Say more on “community of kin”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, one of the cool things that I found in art school was like me and this one other person loved this one artwork by this one artist. &lt;yes, yes&gt; And we found a passion in there that meant we were compatible across all sorts of different things. &lt; Oh my god, you&#8217;re so right!&gt; You know?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah one of my absolute favorite artists is this New Orleans artist named Rebecca Rebouché &lt;yah&gt; I&#8217;m a big fan of her work, very fantasy. She has a lot of portals. &lt;yah&gt; I love that type of thing, and I collect a lot of her pieces. &lt;Simon: Oh, interesting.&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I went to her Art Patron Dinner (and I&#8217;ve been to multiple shows of hers), and I feel like the community that comes around the art &#8212; these are people I&#8217;ve never met before, I have no history, no demographic in common &#8212; it&#8217;s like an instant affiliation and true \u003Cem\u003Econnection\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. &lt;Simon: Yeah, exactly&gt; Because like what better proxy for the&#8230;understanding that kind of like-mindedness, then having that same shared love? Oh my god, I totally agree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s a really precise cultural signal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s also another artwork that I want to mention here that is maybe less known and is working differently &lt;yah&gt; than many NFTs in terms of like dynamics,\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s a project by Sarah Friend &#8212; which I actually showed in another curated show that I did later on called Proof of Stake; and that was all about ownership, in particular &#8212; And she did this piece called Lifeforms, which were designed on Polygon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the NFTs were designed to only &#8220;live”, quote-unquote &lt;yah&gt; &#8212; if they were transferred. And so they had like a like a time-life programmed into them, &lt;yah&gt; where if they stayed in one wallet longer than three months, &lt;yah&gt; they would completely self-destruct.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, got it. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of this, but OG:Crystals? &lt;Simon: Oh yeah, sure&gt; And the artist is Michael Joo, and he did it with Danil Krivoruchko… &lt;mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what&#8217;s really fascinating about it is that the NFT, to your point &#8212; like that&#8217;s an example of like kind of it has to be transferred in order to exist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, with Sarah Friend&#8217;s Lifeforms. Yeah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love that it&#8217;s called Lifeforms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was really interesting on the coral reef diversity side, where every time you transfer this NFT, like the properties of other things in that person&#8217;s collection, &lt;yah&gt; inhabit&#8230; it&#8217;s like an organism, inhabit that NFT. So what happens is, for instance, if you own like MeeBits, then that NFT… the crystal, the form it expresses, will have like this like 3-D, like kind of cubic element to the coral.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It will respond to that shape.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly. And it evolves. And so the art itself evolves as it gets transferred, &lt;Simon: love that&gt; which I think is so fascinating. That is so beautiful. &lt;yah it’s beautiful&gt; I have goosebumps talking about this because that is the essence of truly being native to the medium.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause it&#8217;s not just taking something and then taking it and like, oh, I&#8217;m going to apply it to blockchains &#8212; &lt;right&gt; &#8212; it&#8217;s taking the inherent nature of blockchains and evolving that with the art. It&#8217;s just incredible to me.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, I agree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the online-offline connection’s also still really important &lt;yes&gt; because even the virtual is so physical, right? Because screens are real, pixels are real, &lt;yah&gt; you know, like networks are made of kind of like atoms as well as bits, you know. &lt;yes yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you know the recent body of work that I made &#8212; that was actually named a little bit close to this book from Chris &#8212; So I made oil paintings of other people&#8217;s metaverse property tokens… that was like,\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ahh, so you made the digital physical!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, in a way; because I thought about I thought about territory, I thought about community, I thought about history.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I thought about like the fact that these tokens &#8212; when I looked at something like Decentraland or Sandbox, these very popular you know &lt;yup&gt; crypto-based metaverses &#8212; when I looked at the ownership tokens for owning a piece of property in those worlds, I saw a grid that looked to me like mid-century painting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause it&#8217;s a grid, these projects, &lt;yah&gt; if you buy a token, you kind of get an NFT that looks like a part of the map of the project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I was thinking oh that&#8217;s so interesting because it looks so much like mid-century painting, and then I was like oh wouldn&#8217;t that be funny to paint that actually. And then I was like that would be a landscape painting, of a piece of property, in the metaverse; that&#8217;s so weird.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I was like, what is landscape painting? And that, again, goes back to my background: I grew up in New Zealand, the first thing we learned about is colonial landscape painting… And I was like oh my god when I see these NFTs, this gridded system, it&#8217;s like modernism is being projected onto the metaverse, you know. &lt;That’s fascinating!&gt; So it&#8217;s taking an old modernist trope and putting it onto the mirror.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, it was important for me to underline the networked element as well. So while they were paintings of somebody else&#8217;s property, I included two QR codes on the side of each painting. And the first one links to the original property &#8212; so you can kind of look at the property &lt;right, you can see what it is&gt; &#8212; because that&#8217;s interesting as well about metaverse interfaces: It&#8217;s already gone through a few rounds of UX so the painting is often kind of early version of a landscape, and then you have a link to what the real one looks like now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then I designed an NFT that that looks like an ownership card that you would get in Monopoly for owning a piece of property, &lt;oh! right&gt; &#8212; and tells you who owns that piece right now. And it links you to the person that owns that piece, but it&#8217;s also permissionless. So it&#8217;s a painting, which is permissionless, of a property that you don&#8217;t own; that then you have a kind of other piece of ownership property that kind of always links you to the person who currently owns it. &lt;chuckles&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s like so fascinating exploring the nature of ownership. &lt;yah&gt; So this is the exhibition you debuted in San Francisco [at Altman Siegel]; why did you title it “Read Write Own”?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, I was really interested in always like what are good descriptions of what&#8217;s different about networks. &lt;yah&gt; And when I read about Chris&#8217;s book coming out, and Read\u002F  Write\u002F Own was kind of like underlined as a way to summarize you know Web1\u002F Web2\u002F and Web3.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was the title of the book; It resonated with also the design of the cover; it was a little square in the middle and a kind of landscape-like object around it. And I was like oh my god, this is what I&#8217;ve been painting: I&#8217;ve been painting the difference of ownership &lt;wow&gt; in Web2 and Web3, and kind of how these things kind of layer up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso like ownership is really something that&#8217;s really important in art. It always has been important. You know? &lt;yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, people owning properties, people owning images of other properties. Again, these notions around landscape: When you paint a landscape, it doesn&#8217;t mean you own it, right? It&#8217;s a picture of something you often don&#8217;t own.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The other thing that&#8217;s fascinating to me about what you&#8217;re saying about this &#8212; is that this idea of ownership and what you&#8217;re doing with the paintings in your exhibit for Read Write Own &lt;yah&gt; &#8212; is the idea too that we ourselves are transient humans. &lt;mhm&gt; And the ways we put our stamps on the world, sometimes like the only thing that endures is art. Whether physical or emotionally, like the things we leave behind. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it&#8217;s funny because I used to be a huge fan of Christo and Jeanne-Claude. &lt;oh yah sure&gt; Big fan, because I love landscape art.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou would think it&#8217;s so inane, like you&#8217;re putting plastic to cover trees… &lt;yah&gt; like how is this art? &lt;yah&gt; But I love this idea that humanity is conquering nature in a way that&#8217;s not like extractive &lt;right&gt; &#8212; but that&#8217;s actually beautifying it and showing our presence. &lt;yah&gt; And I find that building, like, it&#8217;s just beautiful. &lt;Simon: It is so beautiful&gt; There&#8217;s something extremely exquisite about it. &lt;Yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich I&#8217;m bringing it up because it resonates with what you&#8217;re describing with the Read Write Own exhibit you did.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, exactly. I mean, Jeanne Christo Claude, for those who haven&#8217;t heard of them, they basically, as a giant sculptural gesture, would wrap significant things &#8212; for example, the Bundestag in Berlin, that was like a really big one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s right. They just did in Paris. Well, actually, one of them obviously died but the spouse is still alive&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, Jean-Claude.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes, and they just did like the wrapping of the…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E …Arch de Triomphe. Exactly. So often symbolic things but also whole islands.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Surrounding the Florida Keys; yeah, right.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah it makes a monumental gesture, but it&#8217;s also at the same time a light touch, right &#8212; You occupy it and then you unoccupy it, right? And it kind of comes back.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly! It&#8217;s like ephemeral. It&#8217;s light touch, but it&#8217;s so heavy &lt;exactly&gt; in the moment that it&#8217;s there. And by the way, logistically&#8230; &lt;Simon: Oh, huge&gt; incredibly different, difficult.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Very resource intensive. Yeah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh my gosh. Yeah, they&#8217;re like massive engineering projects actually.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I bring that up because it is an example of how art is engineering. &lt;mhm&gt; And you&#8217;re describing like a lot of technology is art, as art is engineering.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, absolutely. And I think that&#8217;s exactly what art does really well; I think that’s what NFT art is doing really well &lt;that’s right&gt; for kind of blockchain networks and other types of crypto art as well, like terra0 that we designed &#8212; the notion of kind of being able to give ownership to trees &lt;I love that&gt; over their own sovereign space &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, these kinds of things are only possible because, you know, technologists have architected a certain platform or a certain environment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo let&#8217;s do some quick lightning round style kind of wrap-up, but first, there&#8217;s a couple of recurring themes, so let&#8217;s just kind of pick them up and bring them back full circle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo one is, you&#8217;ve talked a lot about commerce and the relationship to commerce. What do think about this in the context of NFTs and the art in NFTs? Like what would you say, beyond obviously the valuation aspect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah. Well, one of the things about NFTs and art, the fact that the kind of financial container is the same as the kind of artistic container &lt;yes yes&gt; &#8212; One of the kind of knock-on effects that has happened because of that is that often value is accrued completely to price.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that is not necessarily the case for all culture, right; like, there&#8217;s a term like “priceless”. Often you talk about priceless cultural works. &lt;right&gt; But also, there&#8217;s this notion that something cheap can also be something valuable, you know.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that&#8217;s harder to like express in the current technological stack of NFTs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What do you think the opportunity is to build there?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well… I think that there should be another layer of accruing and showing value in NFT projects that is not about how much they cost. I&#8217;m thinking about like something that could be like a curatorial infrastructure for giving different signals that aren&#8217;t only expressed in how expensive something is.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course: Expensive things that are in museums are important culturally and valuable in that way as well. And part of the price of them being so expensive is about how much they’re loved as culture. But you can make something experimental that might not sell at first &#8212; or that might not be expressed as something expensive at first &lt;right&gt; &#8212; that will later be something that is cherished and really valuable. &lt;yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s this notion of the avant-garde; which is something really important to modernism &lt;yes, yes, yes&gt;, where you can have a small group of people doing an experimental thing &lt;very forward&gt; that is really unpopular and very hard to understand at the time &#8212; that then later gets interpreted and valued in a different way. &lt;yes yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that&#8217;s a little bit missing from the NFT art world. Where financial success is the only expression of cultural value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s not that I want to divorce that completely. &lt;Sonal: No, you can&#8217;t… no, totally&gt; I just think that it needs to be more complex than that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I would say multi-dimensional &lt;yah, right&gt; &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause it&#8217;s basically like, if you think about all these properties &#8212; like there&#8217;s community, there&#8217;s belonging, there&#8217;s expression, there&#8217;s the aesthetic, there&#8217;s the technological underpinnings, there&#8217;s so many different dimensions &#8212; you can assess something on, there&#8217;s a reputation. I totally agree that there needs to be more dimensions on that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne example that I think is really fascinating here, so I co-edited a piece by Cuy Sheffield, who works at Visa. And he wrote a very thoughtful piece on “Fantasy Hollywood” and this idea that you can essentially create characters &lt;uh-huh&gt; that can be represented by NFTs, and essentially create a whole set of storytelling around these characters. &lt;uh-huh&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the idea is that NFTs are characters; &lt;yah&gt; and the other point is, it&#8217;s really about who gets to make &#8212; this is a recurring theme in what you&#8217;ve been talking about &lt;yah&gt; &#8212; who gets to make these characters. Because right now it&#8217;s like centralized Disney, or like a certain type of artist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right, the IP world, right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly; And so this idea that you can actually share and create this IP…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, the real idea here is that the NFT in that case is that the NFTs in that sense represent community, belonging, character creation, collaboration, and then a community of storytelling. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it&#8217;s funny because I was debating this with Bob Iger a couple of months after we did our podcast together with Chris Dixon, that we did on the show, which he kind of brought up like, is it really possible to tell really good stories in a decentralized way? And I was like you know it&#8217;s funny you say that because you acquired Lucasfilm, &lt;right&gt; and we talk about Star Wars like this franchise that was created by one person &#8212; and after that many people took over and extended the canon, and did different things with the stories. &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut there&#8217;s actually a pre-story that no one talks about, which is that Star Wars itself is oral myth and storytelling that&#8217;s been propagated over centuries.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right, based on these hero story archetypes; yeah\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly, like the Campbellian myths and the archetypes, exactly, the Jungian ideas &#8212; And that bubbled up into what became Star Wars, which now has become: There&#8217;s a canon and then that went beyond canon. And then we went back to a new canon, and it&#8217;s like continuing. And if you think about the NFT aspect, like this is very empowering for people, and you could add value that way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This relates back to my kind of pop art thing and also the best parts of NFT art, which is this permission listing that I was leaning into with my canvases, you know. &lt;yes, yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis notion that you can kind of take something that has a powerful effect in the world &#8212; like a Campbell soup can or whatever, that has like a cultural effect that you live in and live with &#8212; and you can work with that and make kind of expressions of your own. I mean, that&#8217;s kind of what Andy Warhol did, right, in a way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd there was no kickback to Heinz… But in a way, there was an attention kickback or a kind of valuation&#8230;a branding kickback maybe eventually, because it&#8217;s like the notion of the candle soup can is like&#8230;&lt;totally, totally&gt; it&#8217;s retroactively&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I think that there could be a more… \u003Cem\u003Enuanced\u003C\u002Fem\u003E ecosystem around defining where value is added in that exchange.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That’s right.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI do want to ask you a question &lt;sure&gt; about like where you think generative art and blockchains intersect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think we get to a little bit of a problem here with like term definitions &lt;yes&gt; as well. Because I understand the broader definition of a generative piece is where you set up a protocol, you put something through a protocol, and it has a series of outputs. And those outputs are artworks, right? &lt;That’s right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I think generative art now has come to mean, colloquially, like a particular aesthetic actually. That it&#8217;s not about the process, it&#8217;s rather about like, oh this looks sort of like an abstract shape, it has a gradient to it, it&#8230;you know. &lt;yah you’re right!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI find that trope, unfortunately, a little dull &lt;I agree&gt; because this is where the homogenization question comes in, and it actually starts to get really boring.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the notion of like artists setting up protocols, and kind of having outputs, and that being a methodology &#8212; that I find super interesting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I agree. So I would say there&#8217;s three layers: So one is the generative, as like you actually have a beginning of something and it sets up a protocol, and it creates a certain output. And there&#8217;s a dynamic nature. I mean, the OG:Crystals project that evolves is by definition generative.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And a lot of PFP projects &lt;yah, yah&gt; are also generative by definition, even though that&#8217;s maybe not what you think of generative art &lt;right&gt; &#8212; because this is a by-necessity thing as well, right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make a collection of a thousand things, you&#8217;re not going to design every single one from scratch, the same one. You make up a protocol, and then it produces a thousand of them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That I would argue, is a different definition because this comes to the debate between customization and configuration &lt;uh-hunh&gt; which is&#8230; there is something that&#8217;s truly generative when it&#8217;s like unknown what the output is going to be. &lt;Yah right&gt; Some of the PFP projects fall in this category, not all but some of them, just to be even more  nuanced about it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s actually, in that case, more that you have a set of attributes &lt;right&gt; that you&#8217;re just applying like Crypto Coven, like each of those witches, like they have a very thoughtful&#8230;they&#8217;ve actually written some beautiful pieces, I&#8217;ll link them in the show notes. And how they thought about like sort of the properties that would manifest as different people minted the witches, and how they sort of constrained them. That&#8217;s another aspect of that, so I agree with that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there&#8217;s a third part &#8212; which you&#8217;re saying you&#8217;re kind of bored by, &lt;Simon chuckles&gt; and I don&#8217;t disagree to some extent &#8212; which is sort of this aesthetic &lt;yah!&gt; where now this is all what generative art looks like. I personally do love that aesthetic, I have to say.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the aesthetic, there&#8217;s just a lot of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E No no, I agree, I agree! But like there&#8217;s Zancan and there&#8217;s like really interesting people who are doing very interesting riffs on it. Those are the people that emerged throough the bubble. And Helena Sarin, I love her work. There&#8217;s a lot of artists whose work bubbles up in that sense and they bring a certain element to it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut like Sol LeWitt, &lt;yah sure&gt; how would you connect him into this movement?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, Sol LeWitt is this mid-century artist who basically designed instructions. And when you bought an art piece of his, &lt;yes&gt; you bought the right to perform the instruction &#8212; or even the right to employ somebody to perform the instruction. So it&#8217;s kind of an algorithm that you buy, which is really amazing. These are for wall drawings in the case of Sol LeWitt.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, like coincidentally, they look like what we think of as generative art because&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Its current like block-y aesthetic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, it&#8217;s based on kind of vectors and you know gradients and lines and patterns and stuff like that. &lt;yup yah yah&gt; So it has this kind of abstract element that reminds us of what we think of as generative art now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut Sol LeWitt to me, the interesting part is, weirdly&#8230;so I&#8217;m going to say something maybe controversial here. &lt;Sonal: Love it!&gt; Like the notion of buying the idea is the thing that I like about Sol LeWitt. The way they look on the wall&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Eh!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean fine&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m with you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8230;but like, it&#8217;s you know&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh my god, I&#8217;m 100% with you, Simon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, this is a great example where I think people &#8212; and as a collector, I&#8217;m very careful to watch myself if I&#8217;m falling for the idea of the thing; &lt;yah yah&gt; and also the actual visceral response of the thing. So sometimes I have to hold myself back because intellectually &#8212; and definitely, that&#8217;s a component of my decision-making for sure; I have to intellectually like respond to it, like the visual language, the symbolism, the lore &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut at the same time, I have to have a visceral response… inside that I feel something, &lt;yah yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, visual response that I really &lt;really love&gt; want to look at every day. And that&#8217;s incredible and very difficult to capture.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s very difficult to capture. But that&#8217;s the holy grail of the art experience. &lt;yah yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I do think some projects in the kind of academic, let&#8217;s say, conceptual art moment, which came up in the mid-century in the 60s and 70s, were explicitly anti-visual, right? The work didn&#8217;t exist, you were only moved by the pure idea, right &#8212; that was like a kind of aesthetic notion that came up around conceptualism. &lt;right right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I mean, the earliest example of that (that has actually been interestingly revisited in NFTs actually), is Yves Klein and this moment of the kind of invisible artwork. &lt;Ahh!&gt; He made a piece that was made in French. And basically, it was one of the first motions in the late 50s where people bought something that was actually invisible, and you were only buying the aura, &lt;yah&gt; as a kind of genre.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly an artist, Mitchell Chan, also revisited that in 2017 (prior to the protocols that became NFTs,) but he designed an immaterial artwork that was also based on that notion as mystery. &lt;right right&gt; Because what felt like, at the time, you were buying when you bought an NFT was very ephemeral.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that work, for example, I love &#8212; even though there&#8217;s no visual necessarily associated with it &#8212; I&#8217;m as moved by it as I am by a very visceral painting &lt;That’s amazing&gt;… Sometimes just the idea is the thing that moves you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes. There&#8217;s also this thing that happens with early technologies where people are limited. They think&#8230;they don&#8217;t see the expressivity that&#8217;s possible, &lt;right&gt; and so they almost go for the most reductionist way &lt;yah&gt; of interpreting that piece and thinking about it. &lt;totally&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that &#8212; to bring it back to generative art today &#8212; I think we&#8217;re going to see a lot more very interesting things happen. One thing I will say, from a technological perspective, I ask everybody this question because I&#8217;m obsessed with generative art, &lt;oh interesting&gt; &#8212; again, for a very long time –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich is: What is unique about blockchains? Generative art is not native to blockchains as a medium, &lt;right, yah&gt; but it seems like it&#8217;s found its native new blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one of the technological answers I heard from one of the people on our team, Michael Blau (and a couple of people made this observation) that at the end of the day, it was so compute-intensive to unfurl like the code and the package and the storage involved. &lt;yah yah yah&gt; So there&#8217;s something really great about having this executable on-chain &lt;yah&gt; that lets you kind of unfurl these things visually.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I think it&#8217;ll be really fascinating to see as like the technological constraints get lifted &lt;yah&gt; &#8212; and we advance blockchain performance, scalability, everything &lt;yah&gt; &#8212; what will then become possible &lt;what will then become possible…&gt; when you can unfurl things online, on-chain. &lt;totally&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause I think we&#8217;re going to see, like the thing that you&#8217;re frustrated by, which is a sort of a generic aesthetic, I think we&#8217;re going to see a lot more expressivity, at that point.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, one of the generative projects that I really, really love &#8212; that I think falls under your categories &lt;yes&gt; as well of defining it &#8212; is Terraforms by Mathcastles. I mean I think that is a project which really does all of those things. It plays with history as well &lt;yah&gt; because it&#8217;s this ASCII component. It plays with complexity because of this territory component. &lt;yah&gt; Also, this notion that you have this kind of metaverse of Terraforms that you can kind of invert &lt;yes… right&gt; and participate in on different levels.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike all of that, I think, is again pushing the medium of generative art to something beyond just an output of an algorithm that looks really boring.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I agree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo last question for you… Another recurring theme, especially with your own history, just come full circle to where we started, where we&#8217;ve been talking: &lt;yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you have kind of traveled from this legacy to digital art world. What are some of the things, if you were to tell people on the legacy side &#8212; about the digital side?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the-vice versa, for the digital world, trying to understand the legacy world, what would you sort of say, as a person who travels between both of those worlds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think about it a lot. because I do exactly that, &lt;yah&gt; and I value those communities as much as each other &#8212; I think that they&#8217;re both really compelling places to be, and to care about culture, and to make things, and to learn about things, and to collect things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I would say, speaking to a legacy person about the digital art world, I would say: Take the time to get to know somebody who&#8217;s passionate about what is going on there. And don&#8217;t start with the New York Times or whatever. Don&#8217;t just look at what you see first and come with your priors and biases. &lt;right&gt; Embrace the learning curve that is the exciting moment of getting to know somebody&#8217;s passion, and why they think this project is interesting, and that project is boring.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And what would you say, specifically, about crypto and blockchain art to that same&#8230;?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, one of the challenges I&#8217;ve always had with addressing the legacy art world with crypto and blockchain art is that people in the legacy world hear the word “crypto”, hear the word “blockchain”, and think A) Too complex. I&#8217;m not part of that community. I don&#8217;t understand the technology, therefore, it&#8217;s too much work to engage? And 2) they also have a whiff of kind of a scandal around it or a swindle; To a lot of art world people, that&#8217;s really like a red flag for bullshit, you know? So, like, they just don&#8217;t want to see that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I would also say like you know this is like a little avant-garde community that has its own aesthetic dimensions. &lt;yes&gt; Yes, there&#8217;s a kind of a learning curve to understanding it &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut honestly, in the art world, there&#8217;s always a bit of a learning curve. You have to study art for several years to kind of really get into histories of the avant-garde and whatever. And that&#8217;s a rewarding process. People stay there because they love that. &lt;I love that&gt; They love to get into those complicated discourses and histories.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there&#8217;s actually a lot of rewards for legacy art people if they would kind of take the jump;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And then what would you say on the flip side &#8212; for both the digital artists understanding the legacy world, and then specifically for crypto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, so digital artists understanding the legacy world:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think there&#8217;s a lot more continuity there than they might imagine, right? I think that often around these worlds, the notion of new things has a high premium. And I think understanding histories that actually have played into those is kind of undervalued.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I would say to those people (and I actually often do this), oh, you&#8217;re really interested in this artist that made this kind of digital artwork? Here&#8217;s this legacy art person who you probably never heard of &lt;totally!!&gt;, who did something, like Sol LeWitt or whatever, that resonates with exactly that gesture. And they&#8217;re often really charmed by that, &lt;yes yes&gt; you know?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And by the way, you&#8217;re not saying that (and I&#8217;m assuming this), in a pedantic way of like grumpy, like, oh, that happened before. &lt;oh no!&gt; It&#8217;s more, understand some of the previous movements because it might inform and inspire you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, I&#8217;m a pedagogue sometimes too, so I have to like watch my tone;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the situation is more like: you love this, you&#8217;ll also love this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Clusters of interest.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly! It&#8217;s like an Amazon recommendation or something like that.

You know there&#8217;s this amazing group of people that were making things for cable networks in the 1970s, isn&#8217;t that incredible? Look at this Portapak art that was created around this thing&#8230; And again, it&#8217;s about encouraging and getting the kind of infectiousness of the love that comes at the core of those projects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, I think that&#8217;s a beautiful note to end on, Simon. &lt;yes&gt; This has been a fun conversation.

I&#8217;m looking at kind of space networks and the way that people are imagining about building in outer space. &lt;yes&gt; I&#8217;m building an augmented reality work that is based on a sculpture of a megastructure that will kind of hang in the Auckland Art Gallery in New Zealand, but will hopefully travel in the future as well.

It would be great if you could build an AI that could run for a very, very long time and could get to know you over the course of a lifetime – but \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C\u002Fem\u003E that really be yours.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so there is this vision in which you could do that with a blockchain: You could embed an AI within a smart contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd with the power of zero knowledge proofs, you could also keep your data private.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then over the course of decades, this AI can become smarter, and can help you, and then you have the option to do whatever you want with it. Or change it in whichever way you want; or shut it down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so that&#8217;s kind of an interesting vision for long-running AIs that are continually evolving and continually becoming better: It&#8217;d be better if it were the case that they weren&#8217;t just controlled by a single centralized company.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course: it&#8217;s a very science fiction idea, because there are lots of problems – including the problems of verification; and the problems of keeping data private using cryptography and still being able to compute on top of that data, maybe with fully homomorphic encryption. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; All of these problems continue to be outstanding, but it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s inconceivable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Wow; I love Ali&#8217;s vision there!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love it too, especially given that quote (I think it was Asimov?) that today&#8217;s science fiction is tomorrow&#8217;s science fact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAli, I know you have a meta-framework for thinking about all this stuff that I’ve heard you share  before, can you share that now too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, there is this broader narrative that has existed for quite some time now that&#8217;s only becoming much more accentuated now with the development of things like LLMs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Actually define that really quick Ali just for listeners who aren’t already familiar, just as context.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So LLM stands for “large language model” and it uses some of the technology that was developed at Google back in 2017 – there&#8217;s this famous paper known as &#8220;Attention is All You Need” (that was the title of the paper)and it outlined what are now known as transformers – and that&#8217;s the basis, basically, of some of the new models that people have been training these days, including ChatGPT and so on, all of these are large language models or LLMs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;Sonal: mmm!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was that famous, I think (2018) line from Peter Thiel that “AI is communist and crypto is libertarian”&#8230; That line is like very on point, actually, because AI and crypto in many ways are natural counterweights for one another. &lt;Sonal: uh huh?&gt; And maybe we can go deep over the course of the podcast into each one of these as we go through examples, &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; – but \u003Cspan style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"\u003Et\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ehere are four major ways in which that&#8217;s true:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[1] The first is that AI is very much a technology that thrives and enables top-down centralized control, whereas crypto is a technology that&#8217;s all about bottom-up decentralized cooperation. And in many ways, actually, you can think of crypto as the study of building systems that are decentralized, that enable large-scale cooperation of humans – where there isn&#8217;t really any central point of control.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so that&#8217;s one natural way in which these two technologies are counterweights for one another.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[2] Another one is: that AI is a sustaining innovation in that it reinforces the business models of existing technology companies &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; because it helps them make top-down decisions. And the best example of this would be Google being able to decide exactly what ad to display for each of their users across billions of users and billions of page views.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas crypto is actually a fundamentally disruptive innovation, in that it has a business model that&#8217;s fundamentally at odds with the business models of big tech companies. And so as a result, it&#8217;s a movement that is spearheaded by rebels\u002F by the fringes – as opposed to being led by the incumbents. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; So that&#8217;s the second.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[3] The third one is that AI will probably relate and interplay a lot with all of the trends towards privacy… Because AI as a technology has built in all sorts of incentives that move us towards less individual privacy – because we will have companies that want access to all of our data; and AI models that are trained on more and more data will become more and more effective. And so I think that that leads us down a path of the AI panopticon, where there&#8217;s just collective aggregation of everyone&#8217;s data into the training of these enormous models in order to make these models as good as possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas crypto moves us towards the opposite direction, which is a direction of increasing individual privacy. It&#8217;s a direction of increasing sovereignty, &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; where users have control over their own data. And those two trends, I think, will be very important. And this is just another important way in which crypto is the counterweight, for AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E(4) And maybe the final one has to do with this latest trend in AI – the fact that AI is now very clearly a powerful technology for generating new art; it&#8217;s now a creative tool &lt;Sonal: mm! totally&gt; – that will lead us to infinite abundance of media, infinite creativity in many ways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd crypto is a counterweight to that because it helps us cut through all of the abundance, in helping us distinguish what&#8217;s created by humans versus what&#8217;s created by AI. And cryptography will be an essential part of maintaining and preserving what actually is human in a world where 1000x more of the content &lt;Sonal: right&gt; is actually artificially generated.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo these are all things that we can talk about, but I think that there is this important meta-narrative; and these two technologies are very much diametrically opposing, in many respects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So maybe Ali, to add to that – this is a wonderful summary – and I would say also that there&#8217;s also a lot of areas, where techniques from AI are having an impact in blockchains; and vice versa, &lt;mhm&gt; where techniques from blockchains are having an impact in AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI&#8217;ll give a brief answer here because we&#8217;re going to dive into the details in just a minute; but there are many points of intersection: I guess we&#8217;ll talk about applications of zero knowledge for machine learning in just a minute…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I also want to touch on all these applications where machine learning itself can be used to write code. So for example, machine learning can be used to write Solidity code that goes into contract. It can be used to find maybe errors in codes and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s points of intersection where machine learning can be used to generate deep fakes and blockchains can actually help to protect against uh deep fakes. And so I guess we&#8217;re going to touch on all these points – but, the interesting thing is that there&#8217;s really quite a lot of intersection between blockchains and machine learning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, before we dive into those – one question I have for you Dan, is do you agree with that? I mean I definitely hear Ali&#8217;s point that AI and crypto are very natural complements actually, or counterweights really for each other, or they can be different forces that can kind of check and balance each other almost… But, is this an inherent quality to AI and crypto in your opinion? Or is this just an artifact of the way things are done right now; what parts might you agree or disagree with?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah; so I would say that, if you look at it from far away… the techniques that are used in AI, they seem \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C\u002Fem\u003E different from the techniques that are used in blockchains, right? So blockchains is about cryptography, decentralization, finance, and economics and so on;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas AI is you know about statistics, the mathematics of machine learning and so on; it&#8217;s about big data. The techniques actually look quite different. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; but they&#8217;re actually a lot of places where one side can help the other  &lt;mhm&gt; and vice versa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo maybe the first one to start with is kind of the obvious one that&#8217;s been on a lot of people&#8217;s minds, which is what&#8217;s called the applications of \u003Cstrong\u003Ezero knowledge for machine learning\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E;  this is kind of an emerging area, it&#8217;s called \u003Cstrong\u003EzkML\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. And the reason this has become interesting is because ZK techniques have improved dramatically – because of their application in blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat&#8217;s happened over the last 10 years is sort of unbelievable; you know, something that we don&#8217;t see very often: This idea of zero knowledge proofs, and proof systems in general, they were considered very theoretical a decade ago. And because of all of their applications in blockchains, all of a sudden there was a lot of effort in making them more practical and real world. And as a result, there&#8217;s been tremendous progress (as our listeners know), that now these things are actually deployed, and used to protect real systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, the question then is, can zero knowledge techniques be used to help machine learning? And there are a couple of examples – honestly, we could spend the whole podcast just on zkML – but maybe I can just give a taste, one or two examples where ZK is useful for machine learning;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so imagine Alice has a secret model that she spent a lot of time training and that model is actually very important to her. It&#8217;s very important that people don&#8217;t know how the model works. But she still wants to be able to service requests from Bob, right: So Bob would like to send her some data, she would apply the model to the data, send the result back to Bob.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBob has no idea whether he&#8217;s getting the correct results on the model, right? Maybe he paid for a certain model, and you want to make sure that Alice is really using that model, right; maybe he paid for GPT-4 and he wants to make sure Alice is really using GPT-4, and not GPT-3.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell it turns out ZK techniques can help here a lot. So what Alice would do, she would commit to her model, make the commitment publicly available. And then whenever Bob submits a piece of data, Alice could run the model on that data, sends the results back to Bob – along with the proof that the model was evaluated correctly. So Bob now would have a guarantee that in fact the model that was committed to IS the one that was run on Bob&#8217;s data. Yeah? So that&#8217;s an example where ZK techniques can be useful in the ML case.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I want to kind of stress why this is so important: &lt;Sonal: Yah!&gt; So let&#8217;s look at one example –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo suppose we have a function, a model that&#8217;s actually used to affect people&#8217;s lives. Like imagine, you know, maybe we use a model to decide whether we grant a loan, or grant a mortgage; you know a financial institution might want to use a model like that. Well, you want to make sure that the same model as being applied to everyone, right – that it&#8217;s not the case that, you know, one model is being applied to me &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; and a different model is being applied to you &lt;Sonal: right&gt;. Well, by basically having the bank commit to the model, right; and then everyone can verify that their data is being assessed by the same committed model &lt;mmm&gt; – we can make sure that the same model is being applied to everyone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have to say that there&#8217;s a wonderful open problem here: Which is, that even though zero knowledge techniques can make sure that the same model is being applied to everyone, there is this question you know: Is the model fair? Models can have biases, could lead to unfair results. And so, there&#8217;s a whole area of research – it&#8217;s called algorithmic fairness; there are many, many papers on algorithmic fairness – and it&#8217;s really interesting to ask: Well now that we have a committed model, can we prove in zero knowledge that the model satisfies some fairness definition from the area of algorithmic fairness.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, like how do we make sure that the training process ran correctly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, everything that you said about ZKML is extremely exciting. And as a technology I think it&#8217;ll play a role at making machine learning, and AI sort of generally, more transparent and more trustworthy – both within the context of crypto and outside of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think an even crazier, and maybe longer-term, and more ambitious, application of ZKML – and some of the other verification techniques that the crypto community has been working on &lt;mhm&gt; – is just generally decentralizing AI. Because as we were talking about before, AI is a technology that is almost, inherently centralizing – in that it very much thrives from things like scale effects, because having things within a datacenter makes things more efficient – and so scaling things in a centralized way makes for things to become more powerful, and more centralized as a result.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen also, data is usually controlled by a small number of tech companies in the middle. And, as a result also kind of leads to additional centralization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then finally: machine learning models, and machine learning talent, also kind of controlled by a small number of players.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so crypto can again help on this front by building technology using things like ZKML that can help us decentralize AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there are three main things that go into AI: There&#8217;s the \u003Cstrong\u003Ecompute\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E aspect, and that requires sort of large scale use of GPUs (usually in data centers). There&#8217;s the \u003Cstrong\u003Edata\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E piece, which, again, most of the centralized companies control. And then there&#8217;s the machine learning \u003Cstrong\u003Emodels\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E themselves. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the easiest one might be the prong of compute. Like can you actually decentralize the compute for the training and the inference of machine learning models? And this is where some of the techniques that Dan was talking about – things like zero knowledge proofs that you can use to prove that the process of actually conducting inference, or, training a model was actually done correctly – so that you can outsource that process to a large community. And you can have a distributed process by which anyone who has a GPU can contribute computation to the network, and have a model be trained in that way – without necessarily having to rely on a massive data center with all of the GPUs in a centralized manner.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd there&#8217;s a big question still of whether or not that economically ends up making sense… But at the very least, through the right incentives, you can actually tap into the long tail: You can tap into all of the idle GPU capacity that might exist; have all of those people contribute that computation to the training of a model, or to the running of inference; and provide an alternative to what otherwise would be just the big tech companies in the middle that currently control everything. &lt;Sonal: mmmm!&gt; There are all sorts of important technical problems that would have to be solved in order for that to be possible –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s actually a company in the space that is called Gensyn which is building exactly this. They are building a decentralized marketplace for GPU compute. Very much for the purpose of training machine learning models. And it&#8217;s a marketplace where anyone could contribute their GPU compute – whether it be in their kind of personal computer under their desk, or whether it be idle inside of some data center.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then on the other side, anyone can leverage whatever compute exists in the network to train their large machine learning models. And this would be an alternative to the very centralized, sort of OpenAI \u002F Google \u002F Meta \u002F all – you know, insert your favorite big tech company here &lt;Sonal: yah! chuckles&gt; – alternative that currently you would necessarily have to go with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, before we go into more of this decentralization framework – cuz Ali, you were breaking down compute, and I think you were going to share the other two of those three prongs – But before we do&#8230;both of you guys talked a little bit about all the technical challenges here. So what are some of the technical challenges that need to be overcome here, and that people may or may not already be solving? (I definitely want builders who listen to this episode to also think about what the opportunities are in this space, and where they can address existing challenges; or what are some of the challenges they&#8217;re going to face in building solutions here.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, so maybe I can mention two that I think would be interesting to folks –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[1] So one is basically, uh-imagine you have a situation where Alice actually has a model that she wants to protect. She wants to send the model in an encrypted form to some other party, let&#8217;s say to Bob. So Bob receives an encrypted model, and it needs to be able to run its data on this encrypted model.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell how do you do that? If you have a piece of data that you want to run on a model, but you only have the encryption of the model, how do you make that possible?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is something that we would use what&#8217;s called fully homomorphic encryption for. &lt;Sonal: Yah. (FHE).&gt; It’s a- fully homomorphic encryption is this remarkable tool that allows you to compute on encrypted data.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is kind of mind-boggling that this is possible – but you can have an encrypted model, and you might have some clear text data, and you can actually run the encrypted model on the clear text data and receive and obtain an encrypted result. You would send the encrypted result back to Alice, and she would be able to decrypt and see the results in the clear.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this is actually something that&#8217;s already- there&#8217;s actually quite a bit of demand for this in practice; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; it doesn&#8217;t take much effort to see that the DoD is interested in this. There are many other applications where you can send an encrypted model to a third party; the third party would run the encrypted model on their data; sends you back the results; you can decrypt, and learn something about the data that was given as input to the encrypted model.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question of course, is how do we scale that up? Right now this works well for medium-sized models… and the question is, can we scale it up to much larger models? So this is quite a challenge: a couple of startups in the space, and again, very very interesting technology, it&#8217;s kind of amazing that this is possible at all. &lt;Sonal: yah… really&gt; And we&#8217;re probably going to see much more of that in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[2] The other area is actually what Ali mentioned, another very important area, which is: how do we know that the model was trained correctly?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if I send my data to someone and I asked him to train a model on that data, maybe fine tune the model on that data – how do I know that they did that correctly? Right, they might send me a model back, but how do I know that the model doesn&#8217;t have backdoors in it. There&#8217;s actually a fair amount of work on showing that if the training is done incorrectly, it could send you back a model that would work correctly on all your test data – but it has a backdoor, meaning that it would fail catastrophically on one particular input. This is possible if your training process is not verified.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, this is an area where ZKML comes in: We can prove to you that the training ran correctly; or maybe there&#8217;s some other techniques that might be possible, to prove that the training was done correctly. But again, this is another area – a very active area of research – and I would encourage many of the listeners, this is like a very very difficult problem: proving that training was done correctly; proving that the training data even was collected correctly, and was filtered correctly, and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that actually is a wonderful area to get into if people are looking to do more work in the space.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Fantastic! Ali, is there anything you would add to that?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, definitely. Well I guess if we continue down the path of talking about what it would take to help decentralize the AI stack, I think that in order to decentralize the compute prong – and there are the three important prongs – if we wanted to decentralize the compute aspect, there are two very important, open technical challenges –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first is the problem of verification (which Dan just mentioned) &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; which you could use ZKML for. And you can ideally over time use zero-knowledge proofs to prove that the actual work – that the people who are contributing to this network – was actually done correctly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the challenge there is that the performance of these cryptographic primitives is nowhere near where it needs to be to be able to do either training or inference of the very very large models. So the models today, like sort of the LLMs that we all kind of know and love now (like ChatGPT), would not be provable using the current state-of-the-art of ZKML. And so there&#8217;s a lot of work that&#8217;s being done towards improving the performance of the proving process, so that you can prove larger and larger workloads efficiently. But that&#8217;s an open problem, and something &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; that a lot of people are working on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the meantime, companies like Gensyn are using other techniques that are not just cryptographic – and instead are game-theoretic in nature, where they just get a larger number of people who are independent from one another to do the work; and \u003Cem\u003Ecompare\u003C\u002Fem\u003E their work with one another, to make sure that the work&#8217;s done correctly. &lt;Sonal: Ohhh… interesting.&gt; That is more of a game-theoretic\u002F optimistic approach that is not relying on cryptography, but is still aligned with this greater goal of decentralizing AI – or helping create an ecosystem for AI that is much more organic, community-owned, and bottom-up – as opposed to the top-down that&#8217;s being sort of put forth by companies like OpenAI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that&#8217;s the first problem; the first big problem is the problem of verification.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the second big one is the problem of distributed systems: Like how do you actually coordinate a large community of people who are contributing GPUs to a network &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; such that it all feels like an integrated, unified substrate for computation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd there will be lots of interesting challenges along the lines of: We&#8217;re breaking up that machine learning workload, in a way that makes sense; and shipping off different pieces of it to different nodes in the network; figuring out how to do all of that efficiently; and then also when nodes fail, figure out how to recover, and assign new nodes to then take over (whatever work was being done by the node that failed). So there are lots of messy details at a distributed-systems level that companies will have to solve – in order to give us this decentralized network that can perform machine learning workloads in a way that&#8217;s perhaps even cheaper than just using the cloud.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah… That&#8217;s great.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E …Yeah and it’s totally, definitely true that the ZK techniques today will handle the smaller models that are being used – but definitely the LLMs are probably too big for these techniques to handle today, the ZK techniques; but, you know they&#8217;re constantly getting better, the hardware is getting better, and so hopefully they&#8217;ll catch up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah; before we go on, can we just do a really clear pulse-check then on where we are *exactly* in that – So obviously, what I&#8217;m hearing you guys say is that there are tremendous applications at the intersection of general verifiable computing – which blockchains and crypto have definitely been significantly advancing and accelerating that whole area (we&#8217;ve been covering a ton of it ourselves: if you look at our ZK canon and zero knowledge category, you&#8217;ll see so much of this covered there) –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut where are we \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C\u002Fem\u003E right now in terms of what they can do? Because you guys talked a lot about what they can&#8217;t do yet, and what the opportunity is, which is exciting; but where are we right now, like what can they actually do?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. So right now, they can basically do classification for medium-sized models. So not something as big as GPT-3 or 4, but medium-sized models. &lt;yup&gt; It is possible to prove that the classification was done correctly. Training is probably beyond what can be done right now, just because training is sooo compute intensive &lt;Sonal: right&gt; that for proof systems we&#8217;re not there yet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut like Ali said, we have other ways to do it. For example, we can have multiple people do the training, and then compare the results. Yah? So that now there are game theory incentives for people not to cheat. If somebody cheats, somebody else might be able to complain that they computed the training incorrectly, and then whoever cheated will not be paid for their effort &lt;Sonal: right right, yah&gt; So there&#8217;s an incentive for people to actually run the training the way it was supposed to run.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right. And so basically that sort of – not like a hybrid phase, but it&#8217;s basically like alt approaches until more of this comes to scale, and performance is scaled to a point where we can get there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah; I would say that for some models classification can be proved in zero knowledge today. For training right now, we have to rely on optimistic techniques.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, great.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Ali, you mentioned compute is one of the three prongs – and you also mentioned that data and then the models for machine learning themselves – do you want to tackle now data, and sort of the opportunities and challenges there (where it comes to the crypto\u002FAI intersection).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, absolutely. So, I think that there is an opportunity – even though the problems involved are very difficult – to both decentralize the process of sourcing data for training of large machine learning models &lt;mhm&gt; from a broader community. Again, instead of having a single centralized player, just collect all of the data &lt;yah&gt; and then train the models themselves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this could work by creating a kind of marketplace that&#8217;s similar to the one that we just described for compute – but instead, incentivize people to contribute new data to some big dataset that then gets used to train a model.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty with this is similar in that there&#8217;s a verification challenge – you have to somehow verify that the data that people are contributing is actually good data &lt;Sonal: yah!&gt; and that it&#8217;s not either duplicate data or garbage data that was just sort of randomly generated or not real in some way. And to also make sure that the data doesn&#8217;t somehow subvert the model – some kind of poisoning attack – where the model actually becomes either backdoored, or just sort of less good or less performant than it used to be. And so there&#8217;s the question of how do you verify that that is the case?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is maybe an open hard problem for the community to solve. It may be impossible to solve completely, and you might have to rely on a combination of technological solutions with social solutions – where you also have some kind of reputation metric. That members in the community are able to earn, to build up credibility such that when they contribute data, the data can then be trusted a little bit more than it would be otherwise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what this might allow you to do, is that you can now \u003Cem\u003Etruly \u003C\u002Fem\u003Ecover the very very long tail of the data distribution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one of the things that&#8217;s very challenging in the world of machine learning, is that your model is really only as good as the coverage of the distribution that your training dataset can achieve. &lt;yup&gt; And if there are inputs that are far, far out of the distribution of the training data, then your model might actually behave in a way that&#8217;s completely unpredictable. And in order to actually get the model to perform well in the edge cases – and the sort of black swan data points, or data inputs that you might experience in the real world – you do want to have your dataset be as comprehensive as possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so: If you had this kind of open, decentralized marketplace for the \u003Cem\u003Econtribution\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of data to a dataset, you could have anyone who has very very unique data out in the world contribute that data to the network… Which is a better way to do this, because if you try to do this as a central company, you have no way of knowing who has that data. And so if you flip it around and create an incentive for those people to come forward – and provide that data on their own accord – then I think you can actually get significantly better coverage of the long tail.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd as we&#8217;ve seen, the performance of machine learning models continues to improve as the dataset grows, and as the diversity of the data points in the dataset grows. And so this can actually supercharge the performance of our machine learning models to an even greater degree; [where] we&#8217;re able to get even more comprehensive datasets that could cover the whole community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So let me turn this on its head in that uh…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oooh, go for it, Dan!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8230;If we&#8217;re going to incentivize people to contribute data, basically we&#8217;re going to incentivize people to create fake data &lt;Sonal: yes!&gt; so they can get paid. Yeah? So we have to have some sort of a mechanism to make sure that the data you&#8217;re contributing is authentic. &lt;Ali: Exactly&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you can imagine a couple of ways of doing this, right? I mean, one way is actually by relying on trusted hardware &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;: Maybe the sensors themselves are embedded in some trusted hardware that we would only trust data that&#8217;s properly signed by the hardware. That&#8217;s one way to do things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, we would have to have some other mechanism by which we can tell whether the data is authentic or not.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Completely agree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat&#8217;d be the biggest open problem to solve… And I think that as benchmarking for machine learning models gets better, I think there&#8217;s two important trends in machine learning at the moment &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[1] There&#8217;s improving the measurement of the performance of a machine learning model. And for LLMs, that&#8217;s still very much in its early stages and that it&#8217;s actually quite hard to know how good an LLM is. Because it&#8217;s not as if it were like a classifier where what the performance of a model is very clearly defined. With an LLM, it&#8217;s almost as if you&#8217;re testing the intelligence of a human. Right? &lt;Sonal: mhm!&gt; And coming up with the right way of testing how intelligent an LLM like Chat-GPT is an open area of research. But over time, I think that&#8217;ll become better and better.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[2] And then the other trend is that we&#8217;re getting better at being able to explain how it is that a model works.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so with both of those things, at some point, it might become feasible to understand the effect that a dataset has on a machine learning model&#8217;s performance. &lt;Sonal: yes&gt; And if we can have a good understanding of whether or not a dataset that was contributed by a third party helped the machine learning model&#8217;s performance, then we can reward that contribution –  and we can create the incentive for that marketplace to exist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So just to summarize so far, what I heard you guys say is that –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThere&#8217;s trusted hardware that can help check the accuracy of the data that&#8217;s being contributed, and the models that are being contributed;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAli, you mentioned briefly reputation metrics and that type of thing can help;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EYou also mentioned that there might be a way (not necessarily now, but sometime in the near future) to check how the data is influencing the outcomes in a particular model so that you can actually&#8230;it&#8217;s not quite explainable, but the idea is that you can actually attribute that this dataset caused this particular effect.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there&#8217;s a range of various techniques you guys have shared so far.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, the final thing is that you could do the same thing for the third prong, which is models.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine if you could create an open marketplace for people to contribute a trained model that is able to solve a particular kind of problem. So imagine if on Ethereum you created a smart contract that embedded some kind of test – be it like a cognitive test that an LLM could solve, or some classification test that a classifier machine learning model that is a classifier could solve –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if using ZKML, someone could provide a model alongside a proof that that model can solve that test – then again you now have the tools that you need to create a marketplace that incentivizes people to contribute machine learning models, that can solve certain problems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo many of the problems that we&#8217;ve discussed – the open problems that we&#8217;ve discussed – on how to do that are also present here… In particular, there&#8217;s a ZKML piece where you have to be able to prove that the model is actually doing the work that it&#8217;s claiming that it&#8217;s doing. And then also, we need to be able to have good tests of how good a model is. Right, so being able to embed a test inside of a smart contract that then you can subject a machine learning model to evaluate how good it is. This is another very nascent part of this whole technology trend.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut in theory, it&#8217;d be great if we eventually get to a world where we do have these very open, bottom-up, transparent marketplaces that allow people to contribute and source compute, data, and machine learning models for machine learning – that essentially act again as a counterweight to the very very centralized, enormous tech companies that are driving all of the AI work today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I really love Ali how you mentioned that, because it&#8217;s been a \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C\u002Fem\u003E standing problem in AI in practice that it can solve a lot of things for like the bell curve, the middle of the norm, but not the tail ends. And a classic example of this is self-driving cars, right, like you can do everything with a certain amount of standard behaviors, but it&#8217;s the edge cases where the real accidents and catastrophic things can happen. &lt;Ali: Right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that was super helpful; And I know you talked about some of the incentive alignment, and incentives for providing accurate and quality data – and even incentives for just even contributing anything in the long tail of data overall –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut on the long-tail side: a quick question that popped up for me when you were talking, like, it sort of begs the question of then who makes money *where*, in this system? I couldn’t help but wonder, what does the business model kind of come in then in terms of making money for companies? Because I always understood that in the long tail of AI (in a world of this kind of available datasets), that your proprietary data is actually your unique domain knowledge, and kind of the thing that only you know in that long tail – so do you guys have any quick responses to that?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So I think that the vision behind crypto intersecting with AI is that you could create a set of protocols that distributes the value that will eventually be captured by this new technology, by AI, amongst a much larger group of people. Essentially a community of people, all of whom can contribute and all of whom can take part of the upside of this new technology. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo then the people who would be making money would be the people who are contributing compute, or the people who are contributing data, or the people who are contributing new machine learning models to the network – such that better machine learning models can be trained and better, bigger, more important problems can be solved.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other people that would be making money at the same time are the people who, on the other side, are on the demand side of this network: People who are using this as infrastructure for training their own machine learning models. &lt;Sonal: yes&gt; Maybe their model does something interesting in the world, maybe it&#8217;s like the next generation of ChatGPT. And then that then goes on to make its way into a bunch of different applications – like say enterprise applications or whatever it is that those models may be used for – and those models drive value capture in their own right, because those companies will have a business model of their own.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then finally, the people who might also make money are the people who build this network. Right, so for example: Create a token for the network; that token will be distributed to the community; and all of those people will have collective ownership over this decentralized network for compute data and models that may also capture some value of all of the economic activity that goes through this network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you can imagine any payment for compute, or any payment for data, or any payment for models &lt;mhm&gt; could have some fee imparted on it. It might just go to some treasury that&#8217;s controlled by this decentralized network that all tokenholders that are part of this network have collective ownership and access to as well (as the creators and owners of the marketplace).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that fee might just go to the network. So you can imagine that every transaction that goes through this network, every form of payment that pays for compute or pays for data or pays for models – might have some fee that&#8217;s imparted on it that goes to some treasury that&#8217;s controlled by the whole network, and by the token holders that collectively own the network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so that&#8217;s essentially a business model for the network itself.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Great!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay. So so far we&#8217;ve been talking a lot about the way that crypto can help AI – I mean, to be clear, it&#8217;s not like unidirectional; these things are kind of reinforcing and bidirectional and more interactive than one way –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, for the purpose of this discussion, we&#8217;re really talking about it being like here&#8217;s how crypto can help AI; let&#8217;s now kind of turn it on its head and talk a little bit more about ways that AI can help crypto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, so there’re a couple of interesting touchpoints there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo one that&#8217;s actually worth bringing up is this idea of machine learning models that are used to generate code. So many of the listeners have probably heard of Copilot, which is a tool that&#8217;s used to generate code. And what&#8217;s interesting is you can try to use these code generation tools to write Solidity contracts, or to write cryptography code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I want to stress that this is actually a very dangerous thing to do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ohhh! Do NOT do this at home; okay. &lt;chuckles&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. Yah. Do not try this at home.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause what happens is very often these systems actually will generate code that works, you know, when you try to run it – and, you know, encryption is the opposite of decryption and so on – so the code will actually work, but it will actually be insecure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;ve actually written a paper about this recently that shows that if you try to get Copilot to just write something as simple as just an encryption function, it will give you something that does encryption correctly – but it uses an incorrect mode of operation yah, so that you&#8217;ll end up with an insecure encryption mode.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, if you try to get it to generate Solidity code, you might end up with Solidity code that works – but it will have vulnerabilities, in it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you might wonder, why does that happen? And one of the reasons is because these models are basically trained on codes that&#8217;s out there, they&#8217;re trained on GitHub repositories. Well, you know, a lot of the GitHub repositories actually are vulnerable to all sorts of attacks. And so these models learn about code that works – but not code that is secure; it&#8217;s almost like garbage in, garbage out yah? &lt;Sonal: mhmmm!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so I do want to make sure people are very, very careful – when they use these generative models to generate code – that they very, very carefully check that the code actually does what it&#8217;s supposed to do, and that it does it securely.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One idea on that front – I&#8217;m curious what you think about this – is that you can use AI models like LLM (sort of like ChatGPT) to generate code, in conjunction with other tools to try to make the process less error-prone?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so one example, one idea &lt;oh&gt; would be to use an LLM to generate a spec for a formal verification system: So basically you describe your program in English; and you ask the LLM to generate a spec for a formal verification tool; then you ask the same instance of the LLM to generate the program, that meets that spec. &lt;mm!&gt; And then you use a formal verification tool to see whether the program actually meets the spec.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if there are errors, that tool will catch the errors; those errors can then be used as feedback back to the LLM. And then ideally, hopefully, the LLM can then revise its work, and then produce another version of the code that is correct. And eventually – if you do this again and again – you end up with a piece of code that ideally fully meets the spec, and is formally verified to meet the spec.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd because the spec is maybe \u003Cem\u003Ereadable\u003C\u002Fem\u003E by a human, you can kind of maybe go through the spec and see like, yes, this is the program that I intended to write. And that can be an actually pretty good way to use LLMs to write code that also isn&#8217;t as prone to errors as it might be if you were to just ask ChatGPT to generate a smart contract for you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Clever!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, this is great – and actually this leads into another topic that is worth discussing, which is basically using LLMs to find bugs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo suppose a programmer actually writes some Solidity code; and now you want to test, is that code correct, is it secure? And like Ali said, you can actually try to use the LLM to find vulnerabilities in that code. And there&#8217;s been actually quite a bit of work on trying to assess how good LLMs are at finding finding bugs in software, in Solidity smart contracts, in C and C++.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s one paper that came out recently that&#8217;s actually very relevant – it&#8217;s a paper from the University of Manchester &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; – whuch says that you would run a standard static analysis tool to find bugs in your code; and it would find all sorts of memory-management bugs or potential bugs – just a standard static analysis tool; no machine learning whatsoever.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then you would use an LLM to try and \u003Cem\u003Efix \u003C\u002Fem\u003Ethe code. Yah? &lt;Sonal: mm&gt; &lt;Ali: exactly&gt; So it proposes a fix to the bug automatically. And then you would run the static analyzer again on the fixed code, &lt;Ali: yes&gt; and the static analyzer would say, oh, the bug is still there or the bug is not there. And you would keep iterating until the static analyzer says: yeah, now the bug has been fixed and there&#8217;s no more issues there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that was kind of an interesting paper; this paper literally came out like two weeks ago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, for both of these papers you just referenced, Dan – the one from the University of Manchester and also the one that you guys recently wrote on LLMs not being trusted to write correct code (it could be working code, but not necessarily secure), I&#8217;ll link to those papers in the show notes &lt;Dan: great&gt; so that listeners can find them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust one quick question before we move on from this… So this is about the current state; is this a temporary situation, or do you think there will be a time when LLMs can be trusted to write correct – not just working, but \u003Cem\u003Esecure\u003C\u002Fem\u003E – smart contract code? Is that possible or is that just like way far off?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a difficult question to answer. You know these models are improving by leaps and bounds every week, right. &lt;Sonal: Yah&gt; So it&#8217;s possible that by next year, these issues will already be addressed, and that they could be trusted to write more secure code. I guess we&#8217;re saying that right now, the current models that we have (GPT-4, GPT-3, and so on), if you use them to generate code, you have to be very very careful and verify that the code that they wrote actually does what it&#8217;s supposed to do and is, is it secure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Got it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And by the way, will we get to a point where the code that LLMs generate is less likely to contain bugs than the code that a human generates? &lt;Sonal: yes!!!&gt; And maybe that&#8217;s a more important question, right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause in the same way that you can never say that a self-driving car will never crash – the real question that actually matters is: Is it less likely to crash than if it were a human driver. &lt;Sonal: That&#8217;s exactly right&gt; Because the truth is that it&#8217;s probably impossible to guarantee that there will never be a car crash that is caused by a self-driving car, or that there will never be a bug &lt;Sonal: right&gt; that&#8217;s generated by an LLM that you&#8217;ve asked to write any code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think this will only, by the way, get more and more powerful the more you integrate it into existing toolchains. So as we discussed, you can integrate this into formal verification toolchains. You can integrate this into other tools, like the one that Dan described where you have a tool that checks for memory management issues. You can also integrate it into unit testing, and integration testing toolchains… So that the LLM is not just acting in a vacuum: It is getting real-time feedback from other tools that are connecting it to the ground truth.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that through the combination of machine learning models that are extremely big, trained with all of the data in the world – combined with these other tools – might actually make for programmers that are quite a bit superior than human programmers. &lt;mhm&gt; And even if they might still make mistakes, they might just be superhuman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that&#8217;ll be a big moment for the world of software engineering generally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. That&#8217;s a great framing, Ali…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what are some of the other trends that come in for where AI can help crypto, and vice versa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah… One exciting possibility in the space is that we may be able to build decentralized social networks that actually behave a lot like Twitter might – but where the social graph is actually fully on chain and it&#8217;s almost like a public good that anyone can build on top of.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you as a user, you control your own identity on the social graph. You control your own data, you control who you follow and who can follow you. And then there&#8217;s a whole ecosystem of companies that build portals into the social graph that provide users experiences that are maybe somewhat like Twitter, or somewhat like Instagram, or somewhat like TikTok; or whatever else they may want to build.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it&#8217;s all on top of this same social graph &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; that nobody owns that there&#8217;s no billion-dollar tech company in the middle that has complete control over it, and that can decide what happens on it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so in that world, like that&#8217;s an exciting world because it means that it can be much more dynamic; and there can be this whole ecosystem of people building things and there&#8217;s much more control by each of the users over what they see and what they get to do on the platform. But there&#8217;s also the need to filter the signal from the noise. And there&#8217;s for example the need to come up with sensible recommendation algorithms that filter all of the content and show you a newsfeed that you actually want to see.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this will open the door to a whole marketplace – a competitive environment – of participants who provide you maybe with algorithms, with AI-based algorithms that curate content for you. And you as a user might have a choice: You can decide whether to go with one particular algorithm, maybe the algorithm that was built by Twitter, or, you can also go with one that&#8217;s built by someone completely different.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that kind of autonomy will be great – but again, you&#8217;re going to need tools like machine learning and AI to help you sift through the noise, and to help parse through all of the spam that inevitably will exist in a world where generative models can create all of the spam in the world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What&#8217;s interesting about what you said too is like it&#8217;s not even about choosing between – It goes back to this idea you mentioned earlier, and you mentioned this briefly about just giving users the options to pick from marketplaces of free ideas and approaches that they can decide –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it&#8217;s also interesting because it&#8217;s not even only at a company-to-company level, it&#8217;s really just like, what approach works for you? Like you might be a person who&#8217;s maybe more interested in the collaborative filtering algorithm that was in the original form of original recommendation systems, which is like collaborative filtering across people &lt;Ali: yah&gt; so your friends&#8217; recommendations are the things you follow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen in fact, I personally am very different and much more interested in an interest graph; and therefore, I might be much more interested in people who just have similar interests to me – and I might pick that approach versus say, something else that&#8217;s sort of like hey this is a hybrid approach, your only thing it&#8217;s going to do is X Y and Z.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust even being able to pick and choose that is already tremendously empowering. That&#8217;s just simply not possible, right now. And it can only be possible with crypto and AI. So that&#8217;s a great example. &lt;oh yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWas there anything more to say on how AI can help with trust and security??\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So I think that kind of the meta picture is that crypto is the Wild West. Because it&#8217;s completely permissionless, because anyone can participate – you kind of have to assume that whomever is participating might be an adversary &lt;yes&gt; and maybe trying to game the system or hack the system or do something malicious.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so there&#8217;s much more of a need for tools that help you filter the honest participants from the dishonest ones &lt;mm&gt; – and machine learning, and AI, as an intelligence tool can actually be very helpful on that front.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo for example, there&#8217;s a project called Stelo, which uses machine learning to identify suspicious transactions that are submitted to a wallet – and that flags those transactions for the user before those transactions are submitted to the blockchain. And that could be a good way to prevent the user from accidentally sending all of their funds to an attacker, or from doing something that they will regret later. &lt;mhm&gt; And that company basically sells to wallets (to companies like Metamask) such that then Metamask can use the intel – and then do whatever it wants with it, either block the transaction or warn the user; or, sort of, reframe the transaction so that it&#8217;s no longer dangerous. And so that&#8217;s one example.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are other examples as well in the context of MEV – which stands for minor extractable value &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; or maximum extractable value, depending on who you ask &lt;Sonal: yah! chuckles&gt; – which is the value that can be extracted by the people who have control over the ordering of transactions on a blockchain. And that&#8217;s often the miners or the validators of a blockchain.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd AI here – I mean, can cut both ways in that those participants – if you&#8217;re a validator on a blockchain, and you have control over ordering of transactions, you can do all sorts of clever things to order those transactions in such a way that you profit. You can for example front-run transactions, you can back-run transactions, you can sandwich orders on Uniswap. There&#8217;s a lot- a lot of transactions that you could craft such that you can profit from this ability of ordering transactions. And machine learning and AI might supercharge that ability because it can search for opportunities &lt;yes&gt; to capture more and more MEV.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then on the other hand, machine learning may help in the other way: in that it may help as a defensive tool. You may be aware, before you submit a transaction, that there is MEV that might be extractable from that transaction. And so then maybe you will either split up your transaction into multiple transactions so that there isn&#8217;t a single validator &lt;mhm&gt; that can completely control it, or do something as a way of protecting yourself from an MEV extractor, at some point in the transaction pipeline.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this is a way again where crypto plays a big role when it comes to security, when it comes to trust, when it comes to making the space more trustworthy to the end user.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s an example of AI making things difficult in crypto, and then crypto coming back and making things better for… &lt;chuckles&gt;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I actually have another example like that. &lt;Sonal: yah!&gt; So just like ML models can be used to detect fake data or maybe malicious activity &lt;mm&gt;, there&#8217;s the flip side where ML models can actually be used to generate fake data. &lt;Sonal: yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe classic example of that is deep fakes, right – where you can create a video of someone saying things they never said, then that video looks fairly realistic. And the interesting thing is that actually blockchains can help to alleviate the problem. And so let me just walk you through one possible approach, where blockchains might be useful:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine it&#8217;s a solution that might be only applicable to well-known figures like politicians or maybe uh movie stars and such &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;. But imagine basically a politician would wear a camera on their chest, and kind of record what they do all day long &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; – and then kind of create a Merkle tree out of that recording, and push the Merkle tree commitments onto the blockchain. &lt;mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo now on the blockchain, there&#8217;s a timestamp saying you know on this and this date, you said such and such; on this and that date, you said such and such. And now if somebody creates a deep fake video of this politician saying things they never said; well, the politician can say look, at this time where the video said I said this and that, I was actually somewhere completely different, doing something unrelated.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the fact that all this data, the real data, the real authentic data is recorded on a blockchain can be used to prove that the deep fake really is fake and not real data. Yeah?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this is not something that exists yet. &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; It would be kind of fun for someone to build something like this – but I thought it&#8217;s kind of an interesting example where blockchains might actually be helpful &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; in combating deep fakes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Is there also a way to solve that problem and show other timestamps or provenance – where you can do that sort of verification of what&#8217;s true\u002F what&#8217;s not true without having to make a politician walk around with like a camera &lt;Dan chuckles&gt; on their chest.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes, absolutely. We can also rely on trusted hardware for this; &lt;mhm&gt; So imagine you know, our cameras, the cameras in our phones and such, they would actually sign the images and video that they take &lt;Sonal: yup&gt;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s a standard, it&#8217;s called C2PA that specifies how cameras will sign data – in fact, there&#8217;s a camera by Sony that now will actually take pictures and take videos and then produce C2PA signatures on those videos… So now you basically have authentic data; you can actually kind of prove that the data really came from a C2PA camera.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd now Sonal if you maybe read a newspaper article, and there&#8217;s a picture in the newspaper article, and it claims to be from one place but in fact it&#8217;s taken from a different place; the signature could actually be verified the fact that it&#8217;s C2PA-signed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s a lot of nuances there – C2PA is a fairly complicated topic – &lt;mhm&gt; that there&#8217;s a lot of nuances to discuss and maybe we won&#8217;t get into here;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Dan I remember you talking about this work with me previously (I think it was at our offite); but I also remember from that that it doesn’t stand up to editing? And as you know, editorial people like me and other content creators – and honestly just about anyone (who uses Instagram or any online posting)&#8230; no one, like uploads anything purely, rawly like as they were originally created…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan: Y\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003Eeah, typically when newspapers will publish pictures in a newspaper, they don&#8217;t publish the picture from the camera as-is; they will crop it. There&#8217;s like a couple of authorized things they are allowed to do to the pictures: maybe they grayscale it; definitely they downsample it (so that they don&#8217;t take a lot of bandwidth).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe minute you start editing the picture, that means that the recipient – the end reader, the user on the browser who&#8217;s reading the article – can no longer verify the C2PA signature. Because they don&#8217;t have the original image. &lt;Sonal: Right!&gt; So the question is, how do you let the user verify that the image they&#8217;re looking at really was properly signed by a C2PA camera.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, as usual, this is exactly where zero-knowledge techniques come in &lt;Sonal: mmm!&gt; – where you can prove that the edited image actually is the result of applying just downsampling and grayscaling to a properly signed larger image. Yah? And so instead of a C2PA signature, we would have a ZK proof – a short ZK proof – associated with each one of these images. And now the readers can still verify &lt;mhm&gt; that they&#8217;re looking at authentic images.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it&#8217;s very interesting that ZK techniques can be used to fight disinformation. It&#8217;s a bit of an unexpected application.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s fantastic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E A very related problem by the way, is proving that you&#8217;re actually human &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; in a world where all of the deep fakes creating the appearance of humanity will generally outnumber humans a thousand to one or a million to one. And most things on the internet might actually be generated by AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so one potential solution – which is related to what you&#8217;re saying – is to use biometrics to be able to establish that someone is actually human. But to then use zero-knowledge proofs to protect the privacy, of the people, who are using those biometrics to prove their humanity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo one project in this category is called WorldCoin &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; – it&#8217;s also a project in our portfolio – and they use this orb; people may have seen this like shiny silver orb, that uses retinal scans as biometric information to verify that you&#8217;re actually a real human; and it also has all sorts of other sensors to make sure that you&#8217;re actually alive and that it can&#8217;t actually be a picture of an eye. And it&#8217;s this system that has secure hardware and is very difficult to tamper with –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch that the proof that emerges on the other end, which is a zero-knowledge proof that obscures your actual biometric information, is very, very difficult to forge. And this way, politicians could for example &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; prove that their video stream or that a signature of theirs or that a participation of theirs on some online forum is actually their own, and that they&#8217;re actually human.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What&#8217;s really interesting about what you said, Ali – that&#8217;s a great follow up to what Dan was saying about ways to verify like authentic media vs. like fake or deep-fake media – and this world of infinite media (as you would say) that we live in –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what are the other applications for proof-of-personhood-type technologies like that? I think it&#8217;s important, because this is actually another example of how crypto can help AI more broadly too. Going back&#8230;we&#8217;re kind of flipping back and forth here, &lt;Ali: yah&gt; but that&#8217;s okay because we&#8217;re just talking about really interesting applications, period so it’s fine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well that&#8217;s a really good question… One of the things that will become important in a world where anyone can participate online is to be able to prove that you are human – for various different purposes. There is that famous saying from the &#8217;90s that “on the internet, nobody knows you&#8217;re a dog”. &lt;Sonal: oh yah, yah&gt; And I think maybe-maybe a reshaped form of that saying is that on the internet, nobody knows you&#8217;re a bot. &lt;Sonal: uh huh?&gt; And so then I guess this is exactly where proof of humanity projects become very important &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; – because it will become important to know whether you&#8217;re interacting with a bot or with a human…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, in the world of crypto, there&#8217;s this whole question of governance: How do you govern systems &lt;yes&gt; that are decentralized, that don&#8217;t have any single point of control, and that are bottom-up and community-owned? You would want some kind of governance system that allows you to control the evolution of those systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the problem today is that if you don&#8217;t have proof of humanity, then you can&#8217;t tell whether one address belongs to a single human; or whether it belongs to a bunch of humans; or whether 10000 addresses actually belong to a single human, and are pretending to be 10000 different people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so today you actually kind of have to just use amount of money as a proxy for voting power, which leads to plutocratic governance. &lt;Sonal: yah exactly&gt; But if every participant in a governance system could prove that they&#8217;re actually human, and they could do so in a way that&#8217;s unique – such that they can&#8217;t actually pretend to be more than one human because they only have a single set of eyeballs – then the governance system could be much more fair, and less plutocratic, and can be based more on each individual&#8217;s preferences. Rather than on the preference of the largest amount of money that&#8217;s locked up in some smart contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Actually, just to give an example of that –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, we&#8217;re forced to use “one token, one vote” because we don&#8217;t have proof of humanity. Maybe we&#8217;d like to do one human, one vote – but if you can pretend to be five humans, then, of course, that doesn&#8217;t work. And so one example where this comes up is something called quadratic voting. &lt;Sonal: yup&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo in quadratic voting, basically, if you want to vote five times for something, you have to you have to, kind of, put 25 chits down to do that. But, of course, you can do the same thing, you can just pretend to be five different people each voting once, and that would kind of defeat the mechanism of quadratic voting. So the only way to prevent you from doing that is this exact proof of humanity – where in order to vote, you have to prove that you&#8217;re a single entity rather than a Sybil of entities. And that&#8217;s exactly where proof of humanity would play an important role.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, identity on-chain is actually becoming quite important for governance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally…  That by the way reminded me of an episode that you and I did Ali years ago with Phil Daian, &lt;Ali: oh yah&gt; remember, on “dark DAOs”? &lt;Ali: yes… exactly&gt; That was such an interesting discussion. Totally relevant there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E By the way, is the phrase “proof of personhood” or “proof of humanity”? What&#8217;s the difference, is it the same thing?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ah yah, people use them interchangeably – proof of human, proof of humanity, proof of personhood.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so keep going on this theme then of media, and this kind of “infinite abundance” of media, like what are other examples – and again, we&#8217;re talking about crypto helping AI, AI helping crypto &lt;Ali: yah&gt; – are there any other examples that we haven&#8217;t covered here where the intersection of crypto and AI can bring about things, that aren&#8217;t possible by either one of them alone?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Completely. I mean, another implication of these generative models is that we&#8217;re going to live in a world of infinite abundance of media. And in such a world, things like \u003Cem\u003Ecommunity\u003C\u002Fem\u003E around any one particular piece of media – or the narrative around a particular piece of media – will become ever more important.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to make this very concrete, there&#8217;s two good examples here: Sound.xyz is building a decentralized music streaming platform enabling artists (musicians, essentially) to upload music, and to then connect directly with their communities – by selling them NFTs that give people in those communities certain privileges. Like for example: the ability to post a comment on the Sound.xyz website on the track, such that anyone else who plays the song can also see the comment. (This is similar to the old SoundCloud feature that people might remember where you could have like this whole social experience on the music itself as it played on the website.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s this ability to allow people to engage with the media and to engage with each other – Often in a way that&#8217;s economic because they&#8217;re essentially buying this NFT from the artist as a way of being able to do this. And they are, as a side effect, they are supporting the artist, and helping the artist be sustainable and be able to create more music.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the beauty of all of this, is that actually gives an artist a forum to really interact with their community. And the artist is a human artist. And as a result of crypto being in the loop here: You can create a community around a piece of music – that wouldn&#8217;t automatically exist around a piece of music – that was just created by a machine learning model that&#8217;s devoid of any human element, that doesn&#8217;t have a community around it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so I think again – in a world where a lot of the music that we&#8217;re going to be exposed to will be fully generated by AI – the tools to build community and to tell a story around art, around music, around other kinds of media will be very important as a way of… sort of distinguishing media that we really care about and really want to invest in and spend time with – from media that may also be very good, but it&#8217;s just a different kind of media. It&#8217;s media that was just generated by AI with less of a human element. &lt;yah&gt; And it may be, by the way, that there&#8217;s some synergy between the two:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike, it could be that a lot of the music will be AI enhanced or AI generated. But if there&#8217;s also a human element – like say for example if a creator leveraged AI tools to create a new piece of music – but they also have a personality on Sound, they have an artist page, they have built a community for themselves, and they have a following – then now you have like this kind of synergy between the two worlds. &lt;yah&gt; Where you both have the best music because it&#8217;s augmented by the superpowers that AI gives you; but you also have a human element and a story, that was coordinated and made real by this crypto aspect (which lets you bring all of those people together into one platform).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s really quite amazing that even in the world of music – just like we talked about in the world of coding, where you have a human coder that&#8217;s being enhanced by tools like Copilot that generate code – we are seeing things like this, where an artist is being enhanced by ML systems that help write (or at least parts of the music are being written and generated by an ML system). So it&#8217;s definitely a new world that we&#8217;re kind of moving into in terms of content generation – basically there&#8217;s going to be a lot of spam that&#8217;s generated by machine-generated art &lt;yah&gt;, which people might not value as much as they value art that&#8217;s generated by an actual human.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe another way to say it is one of the points of NFTs was to support the artists. &lt;Sonal: yes&gt; But if the artists themselves are now machine-learning models, then who exactly are we supporting? &lt;chuckles&gt; &lt;Sonal: yah… yah&gt; And so it&#8217;s a question of how do we distinguish, how do we differentiate human-generated art that needs support &lt;Sonal: Yes&gt; versus machine-generated art?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, this is a philosophical discussion for over drinks maybe – but I would maybe go so far as to say that the prompter is also an artist, of sorts. &lt;Ali: yah&gt; And in fact, I would make the case that that person is an artist. And the same thing has come about with &#8211; as this is a discussion and debate as old as time: and it just simply is new technologies, old behaviors. It&#8217;s the same thing that&#8217;s been playing out for eons. And the same thing&#8217;s playing out in the writing, etc., totally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Very true.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well that actually opens up the door for collective art &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; – for art that&#8217;s generated through the creative process of a whole community, as opposed to a single artist;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are actually already projects that are doing this, where: You have a process by which a community influences through some voting process on-chain what the prompt for a machine learning model like DALL-E will be. &lt;mhm&gt; Then you have DALL-E use that prompt to generate a work of art – maybe you generate not 1 work of art but like 10000 – and then you use another machine learning model, that&#8217;s also trained from feedback by the community, to pick from those 10000 the best one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERight and so then now you have a work of art; that was generated from the input of the community; that was also pruned and selected from a set of 10000 variants of that work of art &lt;yup&gt; – also through a machine learning model that&#8217;s trained by the community – to then generate one work of art. That is kind of the product of this collective collaboration.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat&#8217;s incredible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love it.

So, as mentioned, Dan and Lera recently wrote up a great post and have a proposal related to \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fcontent\u002Farticle\u002Fan-overview-of-danksharding-and-a-proposal-for-improvement-of-das\u002F\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Eways to improve protodanksharding\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E, which is this upgrade that is planned for later this year in Ethereum. There is a lot of rich detail in that post, so we&#8217;ll dig in there.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut before we get into all the details, I thought maybe we could zoom out and back up and start with a bigger picture here. So let&#8217;s start with Dan. Help us understand the subject of today&#8217;s talk, data availability sampling. And maybe you could do it without breaking anyone&#8217;s minds here.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EMaybe we could keep it as you know, succinct and accessible to a broader audience as you might be able to. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan: \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESure, so maybe we can zoom out a little bit before we talk about data availability sampling. Maybe let&#8217;s talk about the general goal here. So this is part of the efforts to scale Ethereum.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd so one of the ways to scale Ethereum is using rollups. And rollups actually need to push a lot of data on chain. So a rollup allows you to take, say, a hundred or a thousand transactions and process them all as a single transaction on the Ethereum Layer 1. And then all the data associated with those transactions basically gets pushed on chain.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd as a result, there&#8217;s a need to actually store quite a lot of data on chain. And the question is how to do that. And that&#8217;s exactly where danksharding comes into play. So it&#8217;s a really beautiful, beautiful idea. It came from the Ethereum Foundation, particularly from Dankrad Feist. It&#8217;s a really elegant construction and basically Lera and I wanted to give an overview of how this construction works and potentially look at some options in which it may be, can be improved a little bit.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. Rollups essentially allow execution to scale for Ethereum, but the question is, How do you make the data scale? And danksharding\u002Fdata availability sampling basically adds this missing piece to Ethereum that will allow it to achieve full scaling. This post is kind of quite technical. Some aspects we don&#8217;t explore, like networking, which is also interesting to research and to write about, but we are mainly focusing on the cryptographic aspects of danksharding.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E And I would actually even add that there&#8217;s really beautiful open questions that are still left to think about for researchers if you are interested in this area. There are beautiful questions around coding and polynomial commitments. There are really quite interesting questions. If they could be resolved, we would end up with even more efficient systems.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s excellent context. I definitely want to ask you about those open areas for potential inquiry in a little bit. But before we do that, let&#8217;s talk more about this proposal that would free up space on the Ethereum blockchain. So the blockchain is basically this giant record of transactions happening from the time that this system launched way back when to the Genesis block. How are developers thinking about freeing up space, making it get greater throughput, scalability, cheaper transactions, all of these things that sound great and would make the system much more usable. How do you actually get there? What is required to get these efficiency gains? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E I think the main challenge is that you cannot just ask validators to store more data. It won&#8217;t get you too far. If you want to scale the blockchain to increase the block size by several orders of magnitude, you have to split your block and disperse it to validators so that each validator only stores some fragment of the block. There&#8217;s where the ideas from error correcting and erasure coding comes in that allows you to do that.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo basically increasing the block size without putting too much burden on the validators. I would say that&#8217;s the main technical difficulty. That&#8217;s what danksharding is solving.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E You mentioned erasure coding, and it sounds like that&#8217;s a key piece of this technology that enables it to work. Maybe you could provide some more detail there. What is erasure coding? How does it work, and how does it apply in this context? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Sure, absolutely. So you basically take a block with users’ data and you expand it. You erasure code it, turn a smaller block into a larger block, and this larger block can tolerate some omissions from it. So you can lose some portion of the block.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIn the case of danksharding, you can lose 25% of the block and still be able to reconstruct these missing pieces from what you have. So when you disperse this expanded block to the validators – and the validators go down because some of them are byzantine or faulty – you can still reconstruct from those validators and that&#8217;s okay if they go down and they lose their pieces, the rest of the validators who are still online and still honest can recover those missing pieces. And that&#8217;s why the properties of erasure coding are useful here, just to substitute for byzantine or faulty validators. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E And maybe we can even explain it a bit more with an analogy. It&#8217;s like, you know, if you&#8217;re watching a Netflix movie and say, you know, the Netflix servers are sending packets to your computer and you are watching the movie, well imagine 10% of the packets actually don&#8217;t make it through and your computer only gets to see 90% of the packets.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo, normally you would start to see all sorts of lossy video and degradation in performance. With erasure coding, what happens is if the movie is coded using an erasure code, even if only 90% of the packets get through the laptop has enough information to actually reconstruct the entire movie.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhat&#8217;s interesting is erasure coding is used everywhere, like communication networks wouldn&#8217;t be able to work without erasure coding. And maybe again, just another example, when you have a deep space probe, it&#8217;s sending messages back to earth. There&#8217;s a lot of noise and a lot of them get either dropped or they get garbled, and yet on Earth we&#8217;re able to recover the signal and get those crisp images from Mars.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThat actually also is done using a slightly stronger technique called error correcting codes, where we&#8217;re not only losing packets, but also we are recovering from packets being distorted, being changed in value. What&#8217;s interesting in the context of the blockchain is that all the data is being signed. So we actually don&#8217;t care so much about data corruption because the signature layer will detect data corruption.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo really all we care about, the only thing that a malicious node can do – someone who&#8217;s trying to prevent the data from being reconstructed – the only thing that that node can do is, in some sense, remove pieces that make up the data. So we don&#8217;t care so much about recovering from corruption of the data because that&#8217;s taken care of by the signature.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut we do worry quite a lot about pieces of the data simply missing, and as a result, maybe whoever&#8217;s trying to reconstruct the data is not able to do it. And so that&#8217;s exactly where erasure coding comes in, where we know that the only thing that can happen is that a certain piece of the data is missing. It can&#8217;t be garbled. So if we got it, we got the right one, and that&#8217;s because of the signature. But if it&#8217;s missing, we have to somehow recover. And that&#8217;s exactly as Lera was saying, that&#8217;s the idea of erasure coding. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe way you do that is basically you take your original data – in the case of Ethereum, you would take a block and you would expand it a little bit.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EActually, you expand it by like a factor of four to get more data in the block, so that the data is now redundant in the block, and now you break it into little pieces. Now you can ask every validator, “Oh, you know, you don&#8217;t have to store the entire block – you only have to store this small piece of the block.”\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd if enough validators do their job and store those little pieces – and when we need to reconstruct the block, they send those pieces back to us – if enough pieces get back, then we are able to reconstruct the entire block. In danksharding in particular – again, it&#8217;s a beautiful, beautiful proposal – the recovery rate is 75%. So if 75% of the validators respond and we&#8217;re able to recover 75% of the pieces, then we&#8217;re able to reconstruct the entire block. That&#8217;s kind of the core mechanism that&#8217;s used in danksharding.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s really useful. So it sounds like erasure coding is this kind of technique that enables you to apply some redundancy and backups so that you don&#8217;t lose all of the data so that you can still sort of assemble it, get access to it, see that it exists.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EDan, you mentioned that the reason for doing this data availability sampling is to prevent bad actors from doing certain things, like getting rid of some of the data. What exactly are we defending against here?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, that&#8217;s a great place to go next. So in fact, what happens is, with these proposals for solving the data problem on Ethereum, there&#8217;s gonna be a new transaction type that&#8217;s going to be introduced.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis is called a &#8220;blob-carrying transaction&#8221;, and what it would allow folks to do is basically embed blobs. Each blob is 128 kilobytes. So you embed blobs into blocks. So normally blocks are made up of transactions to do all sorts of things to the Ethereum state. So now, in addition to just the regular transactions that we know and love, there&#8217;s also going to be a blob-carrying transaction or a few blob-carrying transactions per block and as I said, each one is gonna be 128 kilobytes.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ENow the long-term plan, and actually maybe Lera can talk about the transition to how we get there, but the long-term plan is that there could be quite a few data-carrying blobs in every block, which would actually make the block quite large, right? I mean, each blob is 128 kilobytes.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIf you put a bunch of those together, you could end up, actually, you will end up with blocks that are 30 megabytes – and it&#8217;s just not reasonable to ask validators to store these huge blocks. Today, the blocks are only a hundred kilobytes or so, so these would be much, much larger blocks. And so the idea is to basically break up these large blocks into little pieces.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EEvery validator, every node will actually store only this little piece. And now the problem is, what happens if they say that they stored the piece, but in fact they didn&#8217;t? Right? What do we do then? And that&#8217;s exactly where data availability sampling comes in, which is a very efficient way to test at block creation time that, in fact, everybody received their pieces, everybody currently has their pieces, and currently the block can be reconstructed even though it was broken into many, many small pieces. And these pieces are stored, distributed across the network.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E And just before Lera takes over, I just want to make sure that I understand something here. So you said blocks today are about 100 kilobytes. And the idea is that, after all these upgrades, they&#8217;re going to be about 30 megabytes. And part of the reason for that expansion of the block size is to accommodate this new type of data, this blob data, that has a different purpose than what you usually shove into blocks, which is just pure transaction data.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd this blob data is really related to helping these off-chain Layer 2 networks store some data in a more ephemeral manner. Did I get that right?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, I&#8217;m glad you reiterated that cause that&#8217;s important. So these blobs basically are gonna be used by these rollups, right? So the rollups have to store the rollup data.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd so instead today what they do is they store it as what&#8217;s called &#8220;call data&#8221;, which is somewhat expensive and not what call data was meant for. So instead, they&#8217;re gonna store this data as blobs in blocks. And what&#8217;s interesting is these blobs are actually not going to be available to the execution layer of Ethereum.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThey&#8217;re just gonna be stored as blobs in blocks. The execution layer will only see hashes of these big blobs. They won&#8217;t be able to access individual bytes or elements in the blobs, which is the new mechanism. So today, the way this is stored, is, as we said, in call data, and call data, is all available to the execution layer of Ethereum.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo because of this simplification, storing blob data is going to be a lot cheaper than [storing] call data. So in principle, the goal of this is to reduce the costs of Layer 2 systems, right? Because today they have to pay quite a lot to store all their data as call data. In the future, once danksharding is deployed, or even once protodanksharding is deployed, the costs will be a lot lower.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo L2 systems will become much, much cheaper and easier to use.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s great. I love that we&#8217;re having a sophisticated conversation about cryptography and very technical software, and yet we keep using the word “blob”. It reminds me of the ‘80s sci-fi movie \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAttack of the Blob\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E. But Lera, yeah, maybe you could chime in now and talk about this trend and how we get from where we are now to that vision in the future of expanded block sizes.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, for sure. Before I dive into that, just to add two comments to what Dan said, I want to mention that it&#8217;s important the blobs are going to expire and the validators don&#8217;t give any guarantee that they&#8217;re gonna be storing these blobs forever. Right now the expiry is set roughly to 30 to 60 days, that&#8217;s what the Ethereum Foundation is thinking about.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo after this period, during which you will have an opportunity to download all of these blobs and store it locally. You know, the network will drop them, but the commitments to these blobs will persist. And if you need, so if you have the blobs themselves, you can always resupply them to the execution layer with call data.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo as long as you store the blobs, you can prove that those are the correct blobs that you have by resupplying them, because the chain continues storing the hashes of those blobs, the commitments. I also want to mention another important thing is that the fee market for those blobs is gonna be different.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo there’s going to be another fee market. They&#8217;re gonna be priced a little differently. So Ethereum is gonna have these two pipes. One pipe, if it gets congested, you are paying larger fees, say for execution, and if a data pipe gets congested, you&#8217;re paying larger fees for storing the data. So we don&#8217;t yet know how expensive the storage is gonna be. The intuition is that it must be less expensive than call data today. But again, we have to experiment to see exactly how much cheaper it&#8217;s gonna be. And protodanksharding is actually, it&#8217;s a step towards full danksharding but it&#8217;s like an experiment that we are gonna carry out to see how validators are gonna handle this additional load and how expensive the fees are gonna be for storing those data blobs.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo on the way to danksharding, we&#8217;re gonna do this experiment with protodanksharding. In protodanksharding basically, you don&#8217;t apply any erasure coding or error correcting. All you do is you add this special transaction type that carries data blobs. And those blobs are gonna have an expiry and that&#8217;s it.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo the block size is gonna be increased by a little bit in Ethereum. So right now, as Dan was saying, it&#8217;s around 100 kilobytes. With protodanksharding it&#8217;s gonna be around 500 kilobytes or so. So it&#8217;s not that big of an increase, but we&#8217;re still gonna test like all of the hypotheses that hopefully will check out and Ethereum will continue moving to full danksharding.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E So Lera, you said a number of things in there. I wanna make sure that all those points came across. You mentioned that the blob data is gonna have a different fee market. So is the right way to think about this, like you have different highway systems, or perhaps you have a lane on a highway where like you have an E-ZPass or something and maybe it&#8217;s cheaper for someone in this HOV, E-ZPass-style lane? You get lower fees to put this kind of data on the blockchain versus someone who&#8217;s just a regular commuter having to pay a toll. I know I&#8217;m kind of mixing some metaphors here, but I&#8217;m wondering if that&#8217;s a physical analogy to describe these differences in fee markets for different types of data. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, I would say that it&#8217;s hard to imagine this new data&#8217;s fees being more expensive than what we currently have, so the hypothesis is it&#8217;s always gonna be cheaper to put your data in those blobs if you don&#8217;t care about accessing this data from the execution layer. So it&#8217;s as if opening another lane on your highway, that will just increase traffic, but for certain types of transactions, you&#8217;ll go into this lane and for those transactions that are kind of data heavy and for transactions that are execution heavy, you&#8217;ll continue going through the main lanes, if that makes sense.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yes, it does. And it sounds like one of the reasons why it can be cheaper is because it has this expiration date, as you mentioned. I think you said that the current idea is that&#8217;s gonna last 30 to 60 days for this blob data, at which point it would simply vanish and there would just be a trace remaining – a sort of commitment as you described.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yes, exactly. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Maybe to add to that, basically what happens is when you submit transactions, there&#8217;s a fee market, as Lera was saying, in that if there are lots of transactions being submitted all at once, say there&#8217;s a big NFT mint, and everybody wants to issue transactions, then of course the price per transaction immediately goes up.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWell, blob data is gonna be a parallel fee market, so presumably there are fewer people submitting blobs than there are people submitting transactions. So hopefully there will be less congestion over blobs. But in principle, it could happen. Hopefully not, but it could happen that all of a sudden, for some reason, there&#8217;s huge congestion over blobs and then the fee market for blobs will actually go up.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut in principle, again, because there&#8217;s less demand for submitting blobs than there is for submitting transactions, the hope is that the cost for blobs will be lower than the cost for transactions. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Okay. That&#8217;s really helpful to understand as well. So we&#8217;ve laid out a sort of timeline for these updates. Perhaps, people listening in, maybe you&#8217;re familiar with “\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fcontent\u002Farticle\u002Fwhat-the-merge-means\u002F\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe Merge\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E”, which happened last year in the fall, this big Ethereum upgrade that basically eliminated the environmental impact of Ethereum in terms of its energy consumption. And now we&#8217;re entering this new period of upgrades, which Vitalik [Buterin], co-creator of Ethereum, has termed “The Surge”, meaning that all of a sudden, these updates are going to enable the blockchain to scale a lot more powerfully than it&#8217;s been able to before. So part of this update, one of the first ones, is protodanksharding. It&#8217;s happening later this year. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhat happens in between that upgrade and full on danksharding? What are the differences between the two and when do we get that fully formed vision of danksharding in the future?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s a great question. I think there are still some research problems to figure out along the way, especially around networking because when those validators are storing only fragments of the blob, they need to help each other reconstruct those fragments. If some validator falls asleep for a while, when it wakes up, it wants other validators to help it reconstruct its missing fragments.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo it&#8217;s quite an involved networking protocol that is still in the making for danksharding and there are other exciting research problems that potentially can improve the scheme, but I think so far it looks like quite a clear path to get from protodanksharding to danksharding. And the question is just maybe how to make it better, how to improve different aspects of it, make it more efficient.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Maybe it&#8217;s worthwhile adding that in the protodanksharding approach there are at most four blobs per block, which is why each blob is 128 kilobytes. Four times 128 gives us half a megabyte, which is why that&#8217;s the limit on block sizes in protodanksharding, and that&#8217;s actually imminent. That&#8217;s supposed to happen later this year.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd then, yeah, going all the way to danksharding still takes some work. In fact, there was a very big event recently with generating parameters jointly for danksharding. And so there&#8217;s a lot of work to do in preparation of getting to full danksharding.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, that&#8217;s quite exciting. I think they&#8217;re still accepting contributions to participate in the trusted setup ceremony. Yeah, so it&#8217;s still ongoing.

And then danksharding, as we said, they&#8217;re targeting at most 30 megabyte blocks. So just divide 30 megabytes by 128 kilobytes. And that tells you it&#8217;s on the order of a hundred, I guess it&#8217;s about a hundred blobs per block.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, I think the current plan is 128 blobs target and maybe up to 256 blobs per one block.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Great. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E And that&#8217;s exactly when the blocks become quite large.

I appreciate the basic division. Maybe some of the more technical math that you get into in your post would be a little bit harder to convey here, but that makes sense.

So you did this research and you found that with some adjustments, you could potentially get even more efficiency out of \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Feips.ethereum.org\u002FEIPS\u002Feip-4844\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EEIP-4844\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E, which is the more technical name for protodanksharding.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, the bulk of the work was just to understand the danksharding proposal in full, and then we observed some different ways to look into the mathematics – the cryptographic components of it – that hopefully unravel new toolkits that we can use there. So the rough idea, not going too much in depth, is you fit a polynomial through your block.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIt&#8217;s a bivariate polynomial because your block is rectangular. And then you evaluate this polynomial at more points, kind of expanding the block. And the idea is that if you&#8217;ve used these bivariate polynomials – instead of as danksharding was doing it, as a list of multivariate polynomials – you can then apply techniques for bivariate evaluation, bivariate interpolation, and possibly even try to apply bivariate error-correcting codes to that. But it&#8217;s very much an open door for more research and exploration. So in this post we try to explain where more research can be done to improve the scheme in that direction.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. Well maybe I can add to that. I mean, danksharding is such a beautiful idea. Really. The Ethereum Foundation deserves a huge amount of credit for it. And, you know, Dankrad [Feist] in particular. It&#8217;s really quite an elegant construction.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EInitially, we were just trying to understand the details and it took some time to recover exactly all the details of how everything works. And we figured maybe it&#8217;ll help the world to have another writeup that explains how the mechanism works. Initially, I guess the original danksharding, the way it&#8217;s described, is all using univariate polynomial commitments, where we take each row, we view it as a polynomial. Erasure coding is all done using polynomials.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EMaybe I can even teach a little bit of erasure coding here in one sentence. Suppose you have two points in a plane and you want to do erasure coding on them. What you can do is you can just pass a line through those two points, and now you can just publish, instead of just those two points, you can publish those two points plus maybe two additional points on the line.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo now you have four points total. And you know that if two out of those four points make it to the receiver, the receiver can use the two points that it received to recover the line and then recover the original two points. That&#8217;s the whole idea of erasure coding. So of course, instead of lines, we use higher degree polynomials to achieve different thresholds, but that&#8217;s the idea.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBasically, we have two points. We pass a line. We get more points on the line. If only two points of the line make it to the receiver, the receiver can reconstruct the line and recover the original points. And so danksharding actually does this really, really quite elegantly by looking at the block as a matrix, as a rectangular set of data.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd then it basically extends, using these line ideas, both horizontally and vertically. And that actually gives the coded block – where then, pieces of that rectangle are sent to the different validators. What&#8217;s interesting is now that you have a rectangle, you can think of it as a two-dimensional object. That very naturally leads to thinking about this as a bivariate polynomial, exactly as Lera was saying.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhat danksharding does is it gives a very interesting way to commit to these bivariate polynomials. So it builds a way to commit to bivariate polynomials by using commitments to univariate polynomials. And so it turns out that the reconstruction mechanism that was done in danksharding is also based on construction along lines and columns – also construction as done using univariate polynomials. And then as we were working through this, there was this realization that, hey, everything here really is about rectangles and bivariate polynomials. Maybe there&#8217;s a way in which the reconstruction can also be done by using interpolation of bivariate polynomials. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E So in fact, you take your block and you expand it to X by the factor of two in both directions. So you have 4X more points as a result. But those 4X points only encode a small quadrant.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo in principle, you only need one quadrant in order to interpolate and recover all the rest of this encoded block. So 25% of the points should be enough. But as danksharding works by doing univariate interpolations, it needs 75% of the block to do column and row-wise reconstruction.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIf you do bivariate interpolation directly, you should be good with just 25% instead of 75%. So that will improve the number of elements you need in order to reconstruct, to recover the block. It will also improve communication and data availability sampling, but it&#8217;s all due to improved reconstruction.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd now the question, it becomes kind of a mathematical question of how do you do efficient bivariate interpolation? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThere is an obvious need for a better algorithm there. And we were researching this a little bit and it appears so far to be a little bit underexplored. So maybe there were no applications for bivariate interpolation before. Maybe it&#8217;s just a hard problem, or we don&#8217;t know. But that&#8217;s definitely an interesting direction to basically try and improve bilinear interpolation algorithms.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E So what I love about this is just like Lera was saying, for the more algorithms folks in the audience, is that there&#8217;s been a ton of work on doing univariate interpolation. If I give you points on a univariate polynomial, like points on a line, and I ask you to reconstruct that polynomial, there are very good algorithms for univariate polynomial interpolation.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd it turns out the bivariate interpolation problem, somehow it seems like it received less attention. And what&#8217;s really cool here is all of a sudden, the blockchain, Ethereum, danksharding is creating an application for this really natural algorithmic problem of bivariate polynomial interpolation. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWe really need it here. If we had a good algorithm for bivariate polynomial interpolation, we could make danksharding better because reconstruction, as Lera was saying, would go down from 75% to 25%. So to me, this is really quite beautiful in that the blockchain, Ethereum, danksharding is creating this new area of research, or at least prioritizing this new area of research showing, we really need better algorithms, new algorithms, efficient algorithms to do bivariate polynomial interpolation.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo hopefully that will encourage and spur a lot more research on these types of algorithms and presumably they will be very useful for this problem. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E So I love that we dug into the methodology here and didn&#8217;t shy away from the mathematics. I know some of it might sound a little complicated – bivariate polynomials and univariate polynomials. But I especially appreciate how you described these in terms of geometry and shapes, cause I think everybody here can really picture a line going through some points or how a rectangle functions. So I think that really helps ground the kind of work that you&#8217;re doing.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EI want to double click on this statistic that you mentioned where the current proposal as it exists would require 75% of samples in order to be reconstructed, whereas what you&#8217;re proposing would trim that down to 25%. So that&#8217;s a giant difference. 75% to 25%. But it also sounds like just for a casual observer, if you&#8217;re only having 25%, the fact that it&#8217;s just less than 50%, it sounds like, is that really enough to make assurances that this data is available and was made available?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhen you go down to 25% it sounds like, I don&#8217;t know, you might be cutting some corners. So how do you assure people that in fact, just having 25% of data samples is actually enough and that things can work at that level? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, that gets us to the topic of data availability sampling, and what it achieves, I guess, because this reconstruction threshold – 75% or 25% – basically determines how many samples you need to get high assurance that the data is there.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe way you do the sample is that you ask the network of validators to give you back one element, a random element of this encoded block. And if you get it back successfully – and you can verify also once the validators give you back the proof of the validity of this piece, and you can verify it against the commitments that the chain persistently stores – so when you get back the successful sample that makes you sure that the data is available with probability that is one minus either one quarter or three quarters, depending on how your reconstruction algorithm works, whether it requires 25% of the data or 75% of the data. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo every time you do a random sample and it comes back successfully, basically your false positive [rate] – the probability that you think the data is available when it&#8217;s not – drops down exponentially. And the rate at which it drops down depends on how much data you are required in the reconstruction. So if your reconstruction requests 25% of the data, you do less samples and your assurance – the false positive rate – goes down quicker than if you only have a reconstruction algorithm that requires 75% of the data. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo depending on how efficient your reconstruction is, you might need fewer samples in order to have the same assurance that the data is available. So that&#8217;s why you not only improve the reconstruction here, but you also improve the number of samples you need to do for your data availability sampling.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd data availability sampling is interesting because it&#8217;s probabilistic. So the more samples you do, the higher your assurance is that the data is available, right? And you can always amplify this probability by doing more samples to make it clear. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E I think Lera, what you just explained is really, really important.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThat&#8217;s the heart of danksharding and data availability sampling. So I&#8217;ll say it one more time, just so that the audience will hear it twice, cause that&#8217;s really the heart of it. So maybe think of the block. We said the block is gonna be encoded as this rectangle, right? So somehow we go from a block to a rectangle.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe specifics of how that is done is using this erasure coding. But let&#8217;s pretend we went from a block of data to a rectangle. So now imagine this rectangle is literally a rectangle of dots. Every dot corresponds to one piece of the data that&#8217;s gonna be distributed to one validator. So now to do data availability sampling, somebody wants to verify that enough of the dots are actually available.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWe know that if more than 75% of the dots are available, then the block can be reconstructed using the erasure coding method. Or maybe, if what we&#8217;re saying would be used, then only 25% of the dots are sufficient to reconstruct the original rectangle. But how do you know that 75% of the dots are available?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo that&#8217;s exactly the data availability sampling mechanism. What you do is you can kind of imagine you are throwing darts at this rectangle, right? So every time you throw a dart, you hit a random point in the rectangle and then the validator that holds that point has to prove, &#8220;Yes, I really have that point.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ENow you wanna verify that 75% of the dots are available. So imagine you have this rectangle. Maybe only 75% of the dots are there. Some of the dots disappeared for some reason. You wanna verify that 75% of the dots are available, cause if 75% are available, you can reconstruct the entire rectangle. And so what are you gonna do to verify that 75% are there?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EYou&#8217;re gonna throw a bunch of darts at the rectangle. And for every time the dart hits a dot, the validator that it hits has to prove that the dot really is there. And so if you throw a hundred darts and all hundred darts come back saying, &#8220;Yes, the data really is there&#8221;, that gives you a pretty good idea that more than 75% of the data is available.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBecause you know, if less than 75% is available and you throw four darts, you expect one dart to hit a missing dot. If you throw a hundred darts, and all of them come back saying the data&#8217;s available, you have pretty good assurance that more than 75% of the dots are there. And so that&#8217;s the idea of data availability sampling.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EYou just try lots and lots and lots of random points, like a hundred of them. If all of them are there, then you have pretty good assurance that more than 75% are available and you can reconstruct the data. And you see, if you want to get 75% assurance, you need to throw a hundred darts. If you need only 25% assurance, you would need to throw fewer darts than that.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo that would basically reduce the amount of data that&#8217;s needed to satisfy the sampling mechanism. Now, maybe it&#8217;s worthwhile saying that once the data availability sampling check succeeds – so all the hundred darts come back saying, &#8220;Yes, the dots really are there&#8221; – then the validator says, &#8220;Ah, the data&#8217;s available&#8221;.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd then [the validator] goes ahead and signs the block as saying, &#8220;This block passed data availability sampling&#8221;. Yeah, and that&#8217;s used later on in consensus. So that&#8217;s what the test is. Basically, data availability sampling is a very efficient way to test that enough data is available to reconstruct the block without actually reconstructing the block completely.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo I think it&#8217;s good to hear it twice and maybe even a third and a fourth time. But that&#8217;s kind of the core idea that makes this all work. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E I love that, and I especially love the physical analogies that you&#8217;re using with a dart board and throwing darts. I think that really brings it home for people. So we&#8217;re nearing the top of the hour here.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EI wanna get ready to close out. But before we do that, just maybe I&#8217;ll throw it to you both in one sentence. What is the upshot of all of this? Like why does it matter to get these efficiency gains? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELera:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Well, I would say the ultimate goal, of course, is to scale the blockchain and these new techniques would allow it to do that, for Ethereum to achieve full scaling.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThat&#8217;s a really interesting approach, I would say, because in the beginning, Ethereum was thinking about doing sharding, full sharding, and arriving at quite complicated designs. But having rollups helps scale the execution layer of Ethereum, and this leaves it up to Ethereum to scale its data availability layer. Basically, increase the space while rollups increase the execution capacity and those pieces together will give us cheaper and faster blockchains.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, Lera said it perfectly. I mean, really the scaling story for Ethereum is rollups and the way to get rollups to be more efficient and cheaper to use is by solving the data problem. And danksharding is a very elegant and efficient way to do that. So the upshot is a scalable version of Ethereum where rollups are much cheaper to use than they are today.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s great. And if you get cheaper transactions and the ability to make more transactions, I think that opens up Ethereum to do all sorts of new applications that weren&#8217;t possible before with high gas costs and fees.

A lot of the basic framework came from work we did a couple of years ago where we tried to look at&#8230;to separate the fundamentals&#8230; like, the way we kinda think about it is all technology markets have different ways they progress and there&#8217;s a lot of focus on financial markets. This could be crypto and non-crypto. It&#8217;s also true of other kinds of tech. And then there&#8217;s sort of the fundamental progress of the technology, of the user-application infrastructure.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd so, the core idea with this report – which we&#8217;ve been doing now for \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fstate-of-crypto-report-a16z-2022\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Ea couple of years\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E – is to really look at the fundamentals and to take what appears to be a chaotic process and try to understand it and see the overall logic. And so, you know, things like the number of developers, the number of applications, the progress of infrastructure. In a lot of computing waves&#8230;a key metric is price-performance. There’s Moore&#8217;s Law in semiconductors and an equivalent in the blockchain space would be kind of the costs, gas costs or blockspace costs for secure, high-quality transactions.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThere&#8217;s a lot of data in there. I won&#8217;t go through it all. I&#8217;ll let Daren and Eddy talk about some of the details&#8230;which I think show nice progress on a lot of dimensions.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s great. So, you&#8217;re seeing a lot of improvement when it comes to price and performance in web3, particularly with respect to how blockchains perform. Eddy, it looks like you wanna jump in.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E There&#8217;s a ton of things I could pick. Obviously, I&#8217;m a little biased. I like a lot of the statistics in the report. I could definitely choose many trends. Maybe one to highlight is NFT buyers. I thought one that’s really neat is that NFT buyers has decreased since the recent highs, like, in the last year. But they&#8217;re down a lot less than I think you&#8217;d think and down much less than volume, which indicates that maybe there&#8217;s some new interesting patterns that we started to see unfolding in terms of how people buy them and what exactly they do with them. We&#8217;ve seen a little bit of a trend&#8230;this is now more, a little more anecdotal but around more patronage style models where people are purchasing NFTs in primary sales and using them as part of a way to support a creator directly with basically minimal to zero intermediaries.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EI think it&#8217;s a really cool pattern. It&#8217;s a little subtle in the data. Another one I&#8217;d point out if I can do two is that ZK [zero knowledge] slide we have and we show incredible advancements in the pace of proving speeds, proof sizes, and verification speeds. These all make it a lot easier to try to experiment with and incorporate two key benefits of ZK technology, which is scaling through succinctness and privacy. It&#8217;ll just open up a lot of space for people to start to experiment with them since now they&#8217;re finally becoming economically easy to do and fast.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E We got a lot of feedback on that zero-knowledge slide so we&#8217;re definitely gonna spend some time on that. But I want to linger on something you raised at the outset about the number of NFT buyers which has decreased since the highs in early 2022 but has actually jumped up in recent months and actually appears to be possibly starting something of a rebound. I wanna tease that apart a little bit. Eddy, what&#8217;s going on there? Why this difference all of a sudden?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, well, the key point&#8230;and this is a theme of the whole report, right, is if you zoom out despite the volatility, as Chris was alluding to, there seems to be an underlying order in the product cycle, but also an underlying trend, maybe a smoother growth trend. If you squint a little bit when these technologies come in, they pop, there&#8217;s chaos, and then there is adoption that comes slowly after. The NFT buyers slide demonstrates this really clearly. There&#8217;s basically no activity in 2020 and it only begins in early 2021. Where we&#8217;ve stabilized now is still radically above where we were. So that&#8217;s kind of the big picture trend.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhere the excitement is coming in&#8230;more recently, Manifold open editions and a variety of other projects have been making it really easy for creators to experiment, not just with new features and new ways that NFTs can be incorporated into projects, but also with the process of minting them and distributing them. We&#8217;ve seen a lot of contention on the royalty side and it&#8217;s a fascinating other topic that we should probably unpack some other time. But despite the royalty fees, primary sales and direct relationships with consumers are being experimented with. And that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s exactly what we want to see.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Just for people who don&#8217;t know, you referenced open editions. Maybe you could just elaborate on that.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E I&#8217;ll let Daren say a little bit more on open editions but it&#8217;s a way to create mints that often end up being, like, a little cheaper, a little more in the moment and related directly to current efforts by a creator. Daren, do you have any thoughts about open editions?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, I&#8217;d say the big point to make is that it creates a much more accessible experience for people compared to limited editions which often&#8230;you know, the best ones just increase in price to a point where it&#8217;s pricing out 99% of potential buyers. And so, it&#8217;s a cool way to bring more people into the space and drive those organic use cases as opposed to the speculative ones.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s interesting, yeah. So, it sounds like maybe instead of the big-ticket item, the high price, one-off sale NFT, it’s now giving way to something a little bit more open and accessible to broader audiences?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. And look, I&#8217;d also tie this in with what&#8217;s happening in L2s because it&#8217;s not a coincidence that&#8230;if most NFT transaction fees are very high, which is absolutely the norm of what we saw throughout a lot of the late 2021, early 2022 period&#8230;if transaction fees are really high, you&#8217;re not gonna be able to do much with very low price NFTs or things that experiment with all kinds of new features that maybe mutate state on-chain, which is expensive. If gas fees come down and there&#8217;s more high-quality blockspace at a low price, then you can have cheaper NFTs. You don&#8217;t have to justify the expense of a transaction by arguing that it&#8217;s an investment or some speculative behavior. Instead, you can do all the cool kinds of things, all the computer behaviors where NFTs are their own programs and have interesting interactions with other kinds of online objects. Like, that&#8217;s a really cool behavior and that requires very low transaction fees which require scaling, which we&#8217;re seeing in L2s.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo, it all kinda comes together in my mind.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E L2s is a huge, meaty topic that we&#8217;re going to also get into. But before we do that, I gotta say, one thing that really stuck out to me in this report is the fact that active addresses is now at an all-time high. There are more than 15 million monthly addresses making on-chain transactions. That&#8217;s a pretty surprising statistic and especially when you couple it with a decline in mobile wallet users. It&#8217;s very odd that on the one hand, you have, you know, active addresses hitting an all-time high and yet, at the same time, this big decrease in mobile wallet users over the months from the peaks that we saw in early 2022. What&#8217;s going on there? A lot of people were curious about this. Why are we seeing that odd trend in the data?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, that&#8217;s a great one. I&#8217;ll let Daren weigh in on this too. I admit, we have to go another level deeper and probably find additional sources for underlying metrics to really refine the story about why this is, but personally, I use a desktop wallet and I don&#8217;t use a mobile wallet in my day to day. That might change soon. I&#8217;ve been seeing some really great products launched like Uniswap&#8217;s wallet very recently. That&#8217;s exciting to see. But it&#8217;s hard to say. I don&#8217;t know. I can speculate more about how  app metrics can be a little imprecise. The improvements in desktop wallet software and the norm that has been set in crypto for some time about custodying and taking your wallet experience very seriously and leaving it in more secure&#8230;I&#8217;d have to speculate. Do you have any thoughts, Daren?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, I guess the only thing I would add is we&#8217;re seeing more applications that are kind of embedding the wallet experience into the app itself which means that they&#8217;re not requiring users to bring a wallet or their mobile but instead are kind of facilitating the transactions on behalf of users in an attempt to really make it a better user experience that can attract a more mainstream audience. That&#8217;s certainly one trend that we&#8217;re looking at.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EEddy mentioned the Uniswap wallet. I&#8217;m also very curious next month to see what the numbers look like with that new one included because that&#8217;s something we can certainly do. We&#8217;ll continue to update the data. We&#8217;ll continue to look at new players. It&#8217;s clear that the mobile wallet experience isn&#8217;t fully solved yet. And so, we&#8217;re constantly looking for new entrants and builders that are trying to solve some of these hard problems. But to Eddy&#8217;s point, we will have to do a deeper dive on some of the specifics there.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s a great point. Just to also continue to tease that apart another statistic that was in here, in the report, is how web3 games generate 23 times more on-chain transactions than DeFi [decentralized finance]. And there have been a lot of web3 games that have come out in the past year. I mean, more than 700. So, I wonder how that trend is affecting what&#8217;s going on in the industry right now. It seems like we&#8217;re seeing this big uptick in gaming, in on-chain gaming. What&#8217;s going on there?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. First&#8230;the interaction model of a game is so different from a financial interaction model, right? With your bank or your other financial services, I don&#8217;t know that people use them hundreds of times, thousands of times in a session, so to speak, right? You probably issue a couple of transactions a day to credit cards and other things like that. Some days are a little busier than others. But in a game, if you&#8217;re mutating a lot of state, you might do thousands of things. So, it makes sense that games would generally be more computationally intensive and engaging in their use. Of course, that means we need better scaling. That means we need lower transaction fees.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd it&#8217;s worth pointing out that a lot of these game transactions, when you go underneath the hood, they&#8217;re happening on their own network. They&#8217;re happening on the scaling solutions. We&#8217;ve been seeing many more games in the last year pop up on L2s and move between them. So that&#8217;s no surprise at all and maybe to round it out&#8230;in the history of technology, gaming tends to push the envelope in all dimensions, right? Demands for better hardware drove the development of GPUs. All kinds of other hardware advancements like laser mice and stuff like that were pushed to some extent by games. And that&#8217;s also true with software. You know, broadband with low latency internet connections, all these types of things. Gamers have intense demands and are very open to experimentation as long as it creates great and novel game experiences.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo, I&#8217;m a big gamer and I&#8217;m pretty excited to see how it unfolds there. It&#8217;s just not a huge surprise to me given the amount of interesting economic and composability opportunities there are when you bring crypto into a gaming environment.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, what you said there&#8230;it called to mind that meme of that guy with a domino and he&#8217;s got the one small domino and the big domino on the end. When it comes to the way that&#8230;\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Totally.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E The small domino would be, like, Nvidia&#8217;s GPUs helping gamers and then at the other end you have, like, general artificial intelligence.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, yeah, exactly. At the bottom is, like, John Carmack fooling around with making a 2D game look 3D with Doom and then at the top you have, like, John Carmack making the AGI.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E A fun way to look at the timeline, for sure. Eddy, you said a phrase in there while you were talking about on-chain games. You said “mutating state”. While that&#8217;s fine for the computer scientists in the room, I feel like for the more consumer-oriented gamers out there&#8230;what does that look like in on-chain gaming? First of all, what does that mean? Like, what can you do in an on-chain game that you can&#8217;t do in another type of game?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, it&#8217;s a great question&#8230;so by mutating state, I just mean changing around things, like, changing around data, moving around data, manipulating data. Of course, every time someone plays a game, there&#8217;s a lot of data shuffling around. There&#8217;s graphics data, there&#8217;s network data. If you&#8217;re playing a multiplayer game, someone has to run a server and that server is managing the mutations of a lot of data that has to do with the state of the game and what&#8217;s happening in the game. An interesting concept. And we actually have a podcast on this with Arianna and me and Sonal where we talk a little bit about web3 games, \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fweb3-with-a16z.simplecast.com\u002Fepisodes\u002Fweb3-crypto-gaming-on-chain-games-gaming-design-users-more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Eon-chain games\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E. So, I encourage you to listen to that if this topic is interesting to you.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut the basic idea is that when you run a multiplayer game server now, you have to have that run by somebody. And there&#8217;s a little bit&#8230;of course, it&#8217;s not a real big deal in some senses, but you have to trust them to run that server. And that&#8217;s no problem. You know, game companies want people to have a great time playing games. But what&#8217;s interesting is that if you can have that state managed in an autonomous way, like, by no one in particular or maybe just governed by specific rules that are set in place at the beginning of that game or the genesis of that game universe, that becomes really interesting because then you can have all kinds of different people build things on top of that game world or that game state and extend it and remix it and recombine it and take the objects and have them compose with each other in ways that make modding and different kinds of game changes a first class part of the game.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd you don&#8217;t have to rely on the game creator to moderate it. Instead, you can have the whole game governed by rules that are set in place at the beginning which means anybody can change the game but they can&#8217;t make it unfair or they can&#8217;t cheat or they can&#8217;t, you know, shut down and blow up the game for everybody else. So to sum it up in brief, there are interesting things made possible when no one in particular controls the game server that you couldn&#8217;t do if only a specific person is the one responsible for running it.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Well, to that point, Eddy, I think to me the most exciting part of that architecture is the composability it enables. Once you have a trustless server, you have an incentive for third party developers to build on top of it and you have this sort of bottom-up creativity where people can build on…like the way people build a city or something where somebody builds a core and then people build around it. You can imagine something that starts off as a small game evolving into a much larger world and eventually into a set of worlds. To me, it all starts with the trust model of having nobody running the back end of the game.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yep.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s a really good point. And actually, it segues nicely into a question we received. Do you feel there&#8217;s enough community involvement in the steering and development of the industry? Given what you said about including more network participants into becoming owners and operators of this stuff, is there enough community involvement in web3 from what we&#8217;re seeing?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Kinda interesting question. I admit I&#8217;m not 100% sure how to parse it because, maybe I&#8217;m being a little silly. I feel like crypto is obsessed with the community, uniquely, in a fascinating way. Sometimes in a way that&#8217;s silly but often in a way that&#8217;s incredibly earnest and serious and material because one of the underlying core ideas to me is that you can hand control of a project or software or a network or system to a community and, like, authentically hand them control in a way that can&#8217;t be done in a web2 world or&#8230; without legal agreements. So, are they involved enough? I mean, I think I&#8217;d have to go project by project to say but I think crypto rightly is incredibly preoccupied with the way that communities can become involved and incentivized and owners and collaborators all with each other to develop the future protocols of the internet.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Maybe just one data point that we can add from our report is if you look at participation in DAO governance as measured by the number of monthly active voters on Snapshot, which is the most popular platform for DAO voting and proposals, that number has pretty consistently grown even during the bear market which I was surprised to see. You know, 13 million total votes have been cast. Almost two million unique voters, 78,000 proposals. So, the stats just around community driven governance with these DAOs has been growing nicely.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, that&#8217;s great to point out. It is pretty interesting to see that going up. It is really interesting to see some of these maintain an upward slope generally even despite whatever prices and the financial markets are doing. Eddy, at the top you mentioned scaling blockchains and that&#8217;s obviously a huge area. And in particular it has to do with what we were just talking about about increasing community participation because if you can scale blockchains, more people can get involved at lower price points, there are fewer obstacles then to participation. What did we find there?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E In terms of scale?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. How is the challenge of scaling blockchains coming along?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. It&#8217;s a great one. This is one of my favorite graphs. This shows the increase in blockspace on Ethereum L1 being consumed by L2s. And the graph shows that 7% of Ethereum fees now are paid by L2 rollups and there&#8217;s a whole bunch in that category. We published this last year, updated it again this year. That has been a pretty steady and healthy trend upward. That to me is the strongest direct evidence that Ethereum is scaling and we expect that number to keep going up, right, because as L2 technology improves, as the marginal cost of transactions goes down, there&#8217;s more things you can do that are worthwhile, more ways that you can experiment.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThere&#8217;s a variety of technological choices represented in that set. We&#8217;ve got optimistic rollups, we have ZK rollups. It&#8217;s a variety of different approaches. So, I think it&#8217;s going really well. I think this year is gonna be a year of a lot of discussion around L2s, the tradeoffs between them, developer tools around using them, user experience improvements so that users kinda can abstract or reason about what exactly they&#8217;re using. It&#8217;s headed in the right direction. Of course, after the recent upgrade, it sounds like the next big Ethereum technological upgrade is likely to focus at least in part on tech to help scale these L2s even further. So, I&#8217;m excited to see that. I&#8217;m personally in the camp that radically decreasing the cost of blocks, high quality blockspace, is a key ingredient in allowing for experimentation that people need to do to discover the new types of products and things that can really go mainstream. So, I&#8217;m excited for that.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E I would like to repeat that stat you mentioned because it is kind of mind-blowing. Two years ago&#8230;we didn&#8217;t have a report two years ago but if you look back retroactively at 2021, the fees being paid by L2s on Ethereum was effectively 0%. Now last year when&#8230;it was the first time we put out this report. It was about 1.5%. And now it&#8217;s up to 7%. So L2s are paying 7% of all Ethereum fees right now. That&#8217;s a big jump. And a lot of that actually happened in the past month. It was 4.5% a month ago and now it&#8217;s 7%. How are we expecting these numbers to change moving forward through the year?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E They&#8217;re gonna be bouncing all around, up and down. One of the repeated motifs of our conversation and the report is that there&#8217;s no graphs that are straight lines. So, this is not gonna be a straight line up or straight line sideways or down or anything. It&#8217;s gonna have its ebbs and flows. I think it is funny that the more activity that goes onto L2s, then the cheaper it is to transact on L1. So, there&#8217;s some kind of countervailing forces where, you know, if tons of activity, if all the activity moves to L2s, then this actually could&#8230;L1 could get a lot cheaper which could bring in more transactions. I don&#8217;t mean to get confusing but the point is I think it&#8217;ll remain a little bit volatile but in the long term this is likely to equilibrate much higher than 7%.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Eddy, you mentioned an upgrade that&#8217;s in the works on Ethereum that would help scale blockchains more. It would be a nice fit for L2 progress. Maybe share a little bit more insight about that.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, that upgrade many call “proto-danksharding”. It&#8217;s known as EIP-4844. And it&#8217;s an upgrade that sets aside a special pocket for data called blob data that&#8217;s necessary to use in the operation of optimistic rollups but also to some degree zero knowledge rollups. And this separate, little, temporary area of data storage serves the needs of these rollups but without having to permanently store the data and the underlying L1 in Ethereum which is what happens now. So, it&#8217;s just a different type of mechanism that means we don&#8217;t have to store permanently what doesn&#8217;t need to be stored permanently. And that just takes a ton of the pressure of the storage costs because you need to store less.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E And so what&#8217;s the outcome of that?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. It&#8217;s always hard to say exactly and I actually think that, like&#8230;I&#8217;m gonna say something and I&#8217;m gonna contradict myself a little bit, but…some think it could drop L2 transaction fees by more than an order of magnitude. Maybe even two orders of magnitude. And there&#8217;s a lot of reasons to believe that that&#8217;s true and that it makes sense. The part where I disagree slightly is that I think where Ethereum transaction costs or any blockchain&#8217;s transaction costs end up is a function of their demand. And as the price goes down, there become more and more things that are worthwhile. Like, just to give a kind of obvious example, if it really consistently costs less than a penny to send money on Ethereum or near Ethereum, then payments would all of a sudden become a viable thing again which was often talked about in early Ethereum, at least a primitive form of payments.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIf that became feasible, then that would increase demand which would mean that the cost would equilibrate at the marginal value of using&#8230;of admitting a transaction. So, all that&#8217;s to say the cost could go down very significantly. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll go down, like, to an outrageously low amount because then it would be too easy to submit transactions and everyone would be doing them all the time. So, I think the net effect, though, would be much, much, much cheaper, very high quality, very safe blockspace which we&#8217;ve never really had in Ethereum. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert: \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhat you&#8217;re describing reminds me of that principle in economics where you might think if you add another highway it&#8217;s gonna reduce traffic, but actually people end up just using the highway more. It invites more people to come and use that infrastructure and travel across it.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yep, that&#8217;s exactly right. Another similar idea is Jevons Paradox. That&#8217;s J-E-V-O-N-S Paradox that people can look up, where technological progress can make a valuable resource more abundant but actually increases its demand because now there&#8217;s more of it that you can use for that valuable end. So, it&#8217;s not to say that Ethereum&#8217;s gonna become more expensive because of upgrades like EIP-4844. It just means that they may not drop linearly. Like, if we get 10 times or 100 times the throughput, that doesn&#8217;t mean the cost is gonna drop 100 times.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, I would expect&#8230;I think they call it induced demand in economics. I would expect that. And that&#8217;s basically the pattern that happens with every computing resource. So, you know, CPU, memory, bandwidth, most recently GPUs with AI. You basically have this sort of back and forth, right, between the computing resource and the applications. And so the computing resource gets more efficient – sort of Moore&#8217;s law or some other price-to-performance curve – that then kinda acquires users and unlocks application use cases. Those things come along and they use up that new resource. They drive on the new highway. But that in turn then creates this sort of back and forth and that process takes, you know&#8230;sometimes can go in fits and starts. That&#8217;s some of the things we&#8217;re trying to highlight in the report, to try to see the long-term pattern because it&#8217;s not instantaneous when new infrastructure comes along.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo, for example, famously in the early 2000s, there were all these talks about how there was this &#8220;dark fiber&#8221;. We had overbuilt&#8230;a lot of smart people thought we had overbuilt long haul internet fiber and it would never get used during the &#8217;90s. It got overbuilt. Of course, then what happened is you had this last mile broadband catch up. You had applications like video, like YouTube in 2005. And then very quickly we used up all of that dark fiber and much more and we keep laying cables to this day. So, it&#8217;s not always a completely smooth process but I would expect the same thing will happen with blockspace. As 4844 gets implemented, L2s get more sophisticated, other blockchains&#8230;just all sorts of various kinds of scaling solutions – that unlocks new categories. Eddy was talking about gaming earlier which is a category that really requires much lower transaction fees than we have today. That in turn will probably use up that resource and create incentives to create even more of those resources and I think we&#8217;ll continue to see that back and forth over the next decade plus.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWe&#8217;re projecting up the future but, I mean, this pattern has just happened so many times in the last 70 years in the history of computing that I think we can now look back and observe and learn from that.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E So yeah, we&#8217;re gonna be going from dark fiber up to dark blockspace, I suppose. And by the way, at the mention of Jevons Paradox, I saw \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Fauthor\u002Fscott-kominers\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EScott [Duke] Kominers\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E, resident economist on team a16z crypto. He was pretty excited about that and threw a 100 emoji up there. So, you got a nod from Scott. Since we&#8217;ve been talking about technical upgrades, there was one that actually just went off quite recently, the Shapella upgrade. And of course, there was \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fcontent\u002Farticle\u002Fwhat-the-merge-means\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe Merge\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E, the upgrade to POS [“proof-of-stake”]. And this sort of encapsulates the whole transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. We captured the start of that in the report talking about the impact of The Merge. Daren, tell us a little bit about that. What were the energy consumption implications of that whole long process that culminated in The Merge?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, sure. So, as you mentioned, in September of last year which feels like a long time ago now, Ethereum transitioned to a new consensus mechanism which resulted in a drastic reduction in energy consumption. More than 99.9% of energy consumption has been reduced. And if you compare that to other well-known products in industries, you can see&#8230;and we do this exactly in our report. You can see that proof-of-stake Ethereum is very, very low on that comparison and when you look at something like YouTube, Ethereum now consumes about 0.001% of the energy that YouTube consumes annually. We have different sources&#8230;third party sources that we pulled from, like the Ethereum Foundation. You can compare it against things like global data centers which is 78,000 times more than proof-of-stake Ethereum. Gaming in the USA is 13,000 times the energy consumption of proof-of-stake Ethereum. It’s just remarkable to see this all happen in the way that it did.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIt was truly an incredible upgrade that I think will go down in history as one of the most significant upgrades in the history of open-source software development. You can check out all these comparisons and numbers in our report. But it’s really just a cool experience to see unfold. And as of a couple of days ago, we now have withdrawals enabled which I think completes that story with proof of stake and it’s just awesome to see the Ethereum community deliver on these upgrades that have been years in the making. We&#8217;re really excited to see that happen.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E We actually got some questions on this slide. So, I figure I&#8217;ll just ask one. Daren, some people were inquiring about YouTube having a higher energy consumption per year than global data centers and why that would be given that YouTube presumably runs on data centers.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. Maybe first I&#8217;ll say we pulled these from third party sources. Of course, this stuff is difficult to measure and so we recognize that and show these figures really just to illustrate a point. Now with respect to YouTube specifically, I will say that maybe one thing that we could&#8217;ve made clearer is that the YouTube number actually reflects the end user devices that are being powered in order to watch these YouTube videos. So that would explain specifically why it&#8217;s greater than the global data centers because it accounts for specifically the laptop or the phone or whatever that&#8217;s used by the end user in order to watch these videos.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ENow I always make this caveat because I think the world is so dynamic and it&#8217;s hard to measure these different things, but the energy consumption that&#8217;s spent to watch a video on YouTube could have otherwise maybe been spent to go get in your car and drive to a movie theater, which I think just further underscores this point that it&#8217;s hard to measure. And I think that the real win when it comes to proof-of-stake Ethereum is that it eliminated what was really by definition wasteful energy associated with the proof-of-work mechanism. And so, eliminating what is true wasted energy for a system that is now run much more efficiently I think is the big win. But maybe to answer your question specifically, it&#8217;s the YouTube end user devices that are also accounted for in that number.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, and I wanna throw in, Robert, like, I really enjoy seeing this complaint from crypto skeptics because we used to hear so many complaints about Ethereum&#8217;s energy consumption. And that was a big story to see a year ago. We were hearing about nonstop in a bunch of different avenues. And that problem has been solved. It has just been totally and completely solved. And now the best complaint has to do with the application of an illustrative statistic. Like, we&#8217;ve made a lot of progress. You know, the exact, like, YouTube number it&#8230;may or may not be right. It&#8217;s very difficult to measure. But the decrease in Ethereum&#8217;s energy consumption is indisputable and the point is sort of its size and puts Ethereum in contrast with a bunch of other means of consuming energy that are maybe less controversial or less disputed out in the zeitgeist.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo, I&#8217;d say, like, the key point sort of stands and is exciting. An incredibly positive development in my opinion.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E You know, in addition to all that, Eddy, I think there&#8217;s also a meta or macro point to be made about the ability to measure this stuff at all. The numbers are super clear on Ethereum because all the data is public. And that kinda goes into the whole purpose of the report, highlighting all these public data sources and showing all the various metrics.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly right. And I&#8217;d even&#8230;like Daren was saying, I&#8217;m not even sure how we would quantify how much energy is consumed by people driving to movie theaters. That&#8217;s never been, like, a metric debated. I&#8217;m not saying that we need to or that maybe there is some problem or something but just I think crypto maybe gets punished to some degree by the fact that it is so transparent and measurable which means it is easy to scrutinize in public. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing with our report obviously. I think that&#8217;s one of its virtues. But it&#8217;s important to take into context which things aren&#8217;t easily scrutinized, which things are opaque.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, I totally agree. It&#8217;s a great point. And a lot of these private companies, they don&#8217;t have this data readily available whereas in web3 a lot of these things you can look them up. This sort of segues nicely into privacy. We could talk about zero knowledge cryptography which was another slide that a ton of people really latched onto, really loved and were sharing. Let&#8217;s just quickly dive into what we saw there, what&#8217;s been going on in the field of zero knowledge. Daren, maybe you wanna take this one. Or Eddy, I see you unmuted yourself.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Oh, either, either.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Whoever.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Go, Daren.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E I can say in short that the zero-knowledge field is gaining incredible momentum. This is happening across a number of different data dimensions that we track. One we look at is academic publications and we built out a data pipeline that allows us to extract this data, to tie in the metadata, and pull out ZK related publications. That trend has been very much up and to the right over the last few years as the space has really moved from theory to practice. I think more academic people are interested in the potential applications for crypto.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWe also looked at GitHub stars across key ZK repositories. That trend has also been very much up into the right. And so has the daily transactions verifying ZK proofs on Ethereum. That&#8217;s kind of a measure of how ZK proofs are being used in production today. And all these numbers just show really kinda big momentum in the trend, particularly over the last few years. We also worked with our research team to pull together some specific benchmarks that show that the tech itself is improving at an incredible pace just when you look at dimensions like prover time, proof size, verifier time, each of which is important to a ZK scheme in different ways. That has, even just in the last couple of years, seen dramatic improvement, which speaks to some of the stuff that we were talking about earlier. Those are the data trends. I don&#8217;t know if Eddy has anything to add about the development of the space itself.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, that&#8217;s all exactly right. I&#8217;d say if you look at the advancements in the underlying technical capabilities like proof size, verifier time, proving time, advancements in hardware. We have some really cool posts on this. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fteam\u002Felena-burger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EElena Burger\u003C\u002Fa\u003E from our team has some great writeups documenting different aspects of how \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fcontent\u002Farticle\u002Fchecks-and-balances-machine-learning-and-zero-knowledge-proofs\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Ezero knowledge proofs\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E and \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fcontent\u002Farticle\u002Fzero-knowledge-canon\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Ezero knowledge systems\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E have advanced over the last year or two. It&#8217;s accelerating very quickly and that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s this interesting thing where specific fields of cryptography have been revitalized by interest in crypto. You can see it in the academic data, academic slide or academic chart that we have in the report. There&#8217;s been this big pop and increase in attention that academics pay. Our research team is an example of that.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd there&#8217;s all kinds of interesting things that can be done. We&#8217;re seeing privacy systems built out and experimenting using this tech. We&#8217;ve seen all the scaling we&#8217;ve seen in L2. And it&#8217;s kinda the beginning.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Just to add to that. I was chatting the other day just casually with two cryptographers on our team, Dan Boneh and Justin Thaler and we were talking about the history of cryptography. It&#8217;s an interesting field, because you basically had, from a theoretical side, very little happen up until public encryption in the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s. You had, of course, significant engineering improvements. You had to look at things like the codes used in World War II. They were very sophisticated but they were really just more sophisticated versions of the old kind of cesarean codes replacing one letter with another. The key feature was you still had to get together ahead of time and&#8230; with the person you&#8217;re communicating with and trade the codes.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd so, the big breakthrough with public encryption was that you could now&#8230;I can send information to somebody else who I&#8217;ve never met before and never traded codes with just by using their public key which of course at the time seemed interesting but not that probably applicable. That turned out to be the foundation of SSL and all the encryption we use on the internet. Imagine if every time you go to a website you had to have pre-gotten together with the website and traded codes. Like, it wouldn&#8217;t work. So, it turned out to be incredibly important. And also a very important feature of public key encryption is it has two use cases. One is encryption. So privacy preserving features. And then the other is authentication – proving that this document was actually mine and I signed it. And of course, the authentication use case is really the primary use case in crypto.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis also creates confusion. You watch&#8230;I was watching a TV show the other day and they talked about crypto being private, which of course is actually a difficult, only partially solved problem. Anyway, so I think of zero knowledge proofs as, in my mind, the other big major theoretical breakthrough in the long term history of cryptography, really since public key encryption. But because it was so obscure and the method so complex, it was not very practical. And Eddy and Daren can feel free to correct me on the details here if I&#8217;m getting it wrong but essentially it was just so computationally intensive.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOne of the nice side effects of the crypto blockchain movement is that there&#8217;s been just a lot more investments in this area and as a result, you&#8217;ve seen dramatic improvements in these algorithms and the performance. And also, by the way the other really nice symmetry here is that as public encryption has these dual inverted use cases, you know, encryption and authentication, in zero knowledge there&#8217;s also two dual use cases. There&#8217;s the ability to prove something to somebody without disclosing information you don&#8217;t want to disclose. That&#8217;s kind of where the word zero knowledge comes from.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut then there&#8217;s also this ability to prove that you did a computation correctly which is where all the scaling benefits come from. So, I can compute something on my computer and then send the results and then oversee that I did that proof and then someone else can verify that I did it correctly without having to run the computation which would be much more computationally intensive. So, it has all these really interesting properties and it&#8217;s been around since the &#8217;80s but has only been practical recently and it’s getting more so very rapidly. And I would expect this to have many other spillover benefits to other areas in technology outside of the space we work in.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo, I think it&#8217;s a very broadly important and probably underestimated trend in cryptography and in general in computer science.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah, that&#8217;s a really great point. You mentioned that this technology is likely to, or it might spill out into other areas. If we&#8217;re gonna talk about one area that&#8217;s just gotten so much attention lately given the advances going on, it&#8217;s AI. And Eddy, you mentioned a piece from one of our deal partners, Elena Burger. She wrote about the potential implications of zero knowledge technology in machine learning. That might be interesting for people to hear about here.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Oh, man. I feel like we could spend an hour on it. So, I don&#8217;t know how much we should unpack it, but it&#8217;s a fascinating one. I mean, in short, I think… There&#8217;s actually no short way to put it. But maybe the ultra-shortest way. Just two key parts for me. One is AIs are sophisticated computer programs. And one of the core ideas in crypto is, Who controls those programs? As people interconnect and interweave these types of programs with important services on the internet and throughout the world, we should ask, How are these controlled? How do we trust them? How do we verify them? How do we know what they&#8217;re doing and how the economic systems built around them work? That&#8217;s what crypto&#8217;s all about. So that&#8217;s a very crypto topic to me.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd the second maybe more specific piece is that when a model makes an inference or puts some output for you to use or for another program to use, there are a lot of reasons why you want to be able to trust that output. And right now, if you trust that output, you&#8217;re trusting the company and the API that serves that. But at the limit, you can imagine extreme and fascinating cases where people tweak or modify these complex programs to produce outputs that serve their interests and not just yours. Kind of like how, you know, a large social media network might modify the feed to serve their interests. There&#8217;s no reason why someone couldn&#8217;t modify an AI model to serve their interests. You probably want to be able to know that the model is executing exactly what you gave it and working exactly the way that you want. That is verifiable computation, and that has been a story, one of the core stories in crypto, from the beginning.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo, I think that AI and crypto really overlap and zero knowledge technology is one of the ways that we will probably come about being able to verify what AI models do and the economics around them. Just can&#8217;t wait to see how it unfolds.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E And if you look at some of the data just around the internet consolidation that we&#8217;ve seen, three companies control a third of all global web traffic. Five companies represent 50% of the Nasdaq-100&#8217;s total market cap. That&#8217;s up from 25% from a decade ago. It&#8217;s very clear that the internet is consolidating power into the hands of the few giant tech corporations. And AI is only going to make that problem worse. Now I think the credible counterbalancing force of web3 and a decentralized network for compute, I think, makes me at least very interested to see how this all unfolds and what role web3 and blockchain can play in the current trend.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E***\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Let&#8217;s talk about how we can quantify the activity that&#8217;s going on. So, the keystone of this year&#8217;s state of crypto report is this accompanying tool that we&#8217;ve created, the \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fstateofcrypto\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EState of Crypto Index\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E which tries to consolidate and combine all these different metrics to give you a picture of the health of the state of crypto. Eddy, talk us through what the State of Crypto Index is, what it represents.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E The key thesis to me of the index is that there are product cycles and there are financial cycles. And it&#8217;s very easy to see a price and to measure the price action of different assets and mistake that for a synoptic view into the health of an ecosystem. The prices can change. That doesn&#8217;t mean that the builders and the underlying tech is changing. And vice versa. During periods of very exciting development, it&#8217;s not the case that those things will be reflected in the price for the short or long term. It may actually have very little to do with prices that you see.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo how do you tease apart these things and get a sense of how crypto&#8217;s actually doing? One way that we think about it is that on one hand there&#8217;s innovation, on the one hand there&#8217;s adoption. And we think that there are key underlying indicators that you can find from public sources that reflect those things. So, I think if you look at the charts that we&#8217;ve shared, these are just some of the key indicators we think are most interesting and may be most representative of what&#8217;s happening on the innovation side, the supply side and the adoption side, the demand side. They&#8217;re not meant to be perfect. “Index” is obviously a little bit of a metaphor. It&#8217;s not like the S&amp;P 500 or some sort of rigorously defined measure. Far from it. These are just indicators that we think are really interesting that we look at when we try to get a macro view of how the space is unfolding.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd to that end, the way that we blend and calculate them to create the aggregated innovation side and adoption side, we invite you to think of different blends. On our site, you will see a page that allows you to look at each of these metrics individually and to get a sense of how they accumulate together into our larger measures. You can adjust the weights and you can even drop some out to zero because maybe you disagree with how we&#8217;ve blended them together or how we measure them. That&#8217;s totally no problem. We&#8217;re not trying to be authoritative here. We&#8217;re just trying to show public measures that we think are interesting that point at the way we see the product and financial cycles developing somewhat independently.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E So, markets are this interplay between supply and demand. And when you look at a price chart, you know, you go to CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko or something, supposedly you&#8217;re seeing what people are willing to sell a token at and what price people are willing to buy it at sort of netting out&#8230;creating the price for that token on the open market. But that&#8217;s really focusing, like you said, on the financial side of things when also there are these tech markets, these product markets of, like, what are builders actually building, what applications are they putting together, how many smart contracts are they deploying and who&#8217;s actually using this stuff, who&#8217;s transacting with it.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd so that&#8217;s why you get that supply side correlating to innovation, actually what&#8217;s being built, and then the demand side, being adoption, who&#8217;s actually using this stuff. I think it&#8217;s a really interesting way to look at a market in a nonfinancial way because it still involves supply and demand, just at a different angle than people are usually accustomed to.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. I think that&#8217;s exactly right. And we hope over the coming months and years to improve and adapt this. We&#8217;d love people&#8217;s feedback, thoughts about interesting types of measures. Of course, we prefer public measures that everybody can see and everybody can understand together but we&#8217;d love to update it, we&#8217;d love to refresh it. We hope to add new categories as they unfold. It&#8217;s just meant to be a wide view that we think is a little bit more legible and a little bit more indicative of what&#8217;s actually developing than just prices.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Daren, walk us through some of the data points that went into here.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Sure. So, you mentioned we split it out between innovation which is the supply side and adoption which is the demand side. And maybe just to list out the specific metrics that are included in each of those categories. On the innovation side, we looked at something we call active developers which is the number of unique GitHub users who have committed to or forked a public crypto repository during the month. All of these metrics, by the way, are aggregated monthly. We can also expand that set into a category that we call interested developers which includes anybody&#8230;any unique GitHub user that has committed to fork or starred a crypto repository. So that is the second category in the innovation bucket.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe third category is the number of contract deployers, so developers who are deploying smart contracts on one of the tracked blockchains that we look at. We can also look at something called verified smart contracts which we think is an indicator for product launches because once you deploy your smart contract, the first thing that a developer usually does is get that smart contract verified. So, it&#8217;s another indicator of developer activity.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWe also look at developer library downloads, specifically web3.js and ethers.js and how that trend looks month over month. We look at academic publications. So, we have a tool that allows us to extract all of the crypto related publications from the academic world and track that metric over time. And then we also look at job search trends. So, people who are searching the web for crypto related jobs. And those seven metrics make up the innovation indicator bucket. Again, we track those metrics over a monthly aggregation period and roll those into the index along with the adoption indicators.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E And just by the way one thing that&#8217;s interesting about the innovation indicators when you look at the charts just generally, a lot of them sustain. A lot of them have been increasing over time and just kinda going up. It just goes to show that despite the market seasonality or what it might appear prices are doing, what people are actually building is totally separate from that. The building activity continues undaunted. Winters are for building, so they say.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s right.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Exactly. And that&#8217;s a key takeaway from the work we&#8217;ve done here with the State of Crypto Index. The innovation indicators are much more steady, a lot less volatile than what we&#8217;re seeing on the adoption side which maybe is a little bit more tied to the market cycles. And it&#8217;s a function of everything that we&#8217;ve been talking about, the fact that builders tend to stick around. Builders keep building in the bear market. All of that stuff I think is really quantified by that trend that we&#8217;re seeing, which is that the innovation or supply side is much more steady than the adoption or demand side.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E It&#8217;s funny that we might be in a winter and yet in terms of the product cycle things are going pretty well. There&#8217;s a lot of really amazing activity happening right now. Is there a place for winter, then? Is winter a good thing?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E I think both sides are important, right. I think the thesis is that there is an upside to the hot summer, as crazy as it is. As much as sometimes financial excitement exceeds our current technological capabilities because it attracts new people who stick around and will continue building as I think a lot of the metrics that we showed demonstrate. They&#8217;ll continue building even when prices cool down. So, the summer\u002Fwinter is how to think about the new entrants, the revolving door of people who come into crypto and kinda see what it&#8217;s capable of in the long term and wanna stick around and help build that. Although honestly, I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s as seasonal in the product cycle. It kinda reminds me of California. Weather&#8217;s always the same. There&#8217;s no winter, there&#8217;s no summer. I don’t think it&#8217;s a coincidence that it&#8217;s such a fit.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Nice. Springtime is breaking over here in New York. It&#8217;s quite lovely. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren: \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EPart of the reason why I think we look so much at product cycles is because financial cycles are just very hard to predict, right? They fluctuate very unpredictably based on macroeconomic conditions whereas product cycles follow their own internal logic and it&#8217;s often based on consumer behavior and broader tech trends that we&#8217;ve seen play out over history. And if you look back since 2000, you can see that good companies have been created in every financial market cycle and I think that&#8217;s an important point to recognize here. For example, if you decided to ignore tech after the dotcom crash, you would&#8217;ve missed industry defining companies like Facebook and YouTube that were born in that era. Similarly, if you would&#8217;ve been spooked by the global financial crisis, you would&#8217;ve missed iconic companies like Instagram and WhatsApp and many others.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd so, we often look at these product cycles through our own internal perspective that we build meeting with these entrepreneurs and technologists&#8230;the product cycle is something that we feel very excited about and it’s something that we&#8217;ve seen continue to progress despite the down market from a financial cycle point of view.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E What you can kinda see if you zoom out&#8230;and this is in our slide deck, is that although it looks kinda chaotic on the shorter time cycles, when you zoom out, you see a real predictable pattern and steady growth, steady compounding growth overall.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E And maybe to get a little bit more specific with the data, what&#8217;s cool about the insights here is that you can actually align these very specific metrics on the same X axis, the same time axis and you can see when the big swings happen. The key insight that I think comes out of this analysis is that the big swings in things like developer activity – which is measured as the activity that we&#8217;re seeing on public GitHub crypto repositories – that upswing tends to happen in the months shortly after the price swings, which implies that the price brings interest and with that interest, that turns into new developers that are building new products. You can see on the time axis just how the price comes first as a leading indicator for some of the developer activity, the startups, the social media interest often is really triggered by the price itself and you can visually see that with the data.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EJust to complete the list so people can understand exactly what goes into this index, on the adoption or demand side, we look at active addresses. So unique on-chain addresses that initiate transactions during the monthly period across the tracked blockchains that we have. We look at the raw transaction counts over time. We look at transaction fees that are paid by users in aggregate over the period across the different blockchains. We look at mobile wallet users from Apptopia which is a metric that we look closely at. We look at volume on decentralized exchanges. We look at the number of buyers of NFTs each month and then the on-chain transaction volume for stablecoins. And those seven metrics make up the adoption indicators category and together we roll that into the State of Crypto Index which really is just a culmination of all this data, analytics, and market research that we do and we like to bring it all together in a way that is very flexible. We, as Eddy mentioned, give users the ability to update the weights and the thresholds themselves. It&#8217;s just a data tool that is designed to give people a point of view on how the nonfinancial oriented metrics are performing when it comes to the health of the crypto industry.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo, it’s something we&#8217;re really excited to be sharing.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s a lot of metrics. That&#8217;s a lot of data to combine, to roll up into one single output, one number that sums up the whole state of crypto. Eddy, maybe you could share a little bit about what that number represents.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EEddy:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Yeah. It&#8217;s an interesting one. You should consider the net percent growth for that category. So of course, we have to pick a time to begin measuring a specific metric. Let me give you an example of, like, an absurd choice. If you decided to start measuring Facebook&#8217;s growth starting from the first user, they&#8217;ve grown to more than 1.3 billion, 1.4, I don&#8217;t know the latest metrics but billions of users. If you consider that percent growth, 1.3 billion percent growth, that&#8217;d be a little absurd. You need to pick a specific time period against which to measure growth. Typically, what data people do to avoid introducing weird biases as a result of how they start measuring one of these metrics is they&#8217;ll aggregate to a notional period like a month or a year and they&#8217;ll round it out that way and say, &#8220;All right. This year we had this number and next year we have this number and so on.&#8221; And they measure growth against the yearly aggregates.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIn cases where we could, when there&#8217;s a long enough time period and it makes sense to aggregate to a nice level of granularity, we choose a starting period to measure growth from there for each sub metric. Of course, you can actually&#8230;on our website you&#8217;ll see that you can adjust that period so that if you disagree with how we used our best judgment to decide when you should start measuring percent growth, you can do so. But the point is just to say for each of these metrics, How much did they grow from that starting point? That means they can go negative. This especially makes it not a real index in some scientific sense of the term. But it should be an accurate measure of how to think about how much those categories, those measures grew all together whether that&#8217;s the adoption side or the innovation side.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E Maybe just to summarize it, I think the actual value of the index is the weighted average monthly growth of all of the included metrics under certain assumptions that Eddy has gone into detail on. But it&#8217;s that weighted average monthly growth since 2016 for the included metrics which we believe is a fair representation of how the industry as a whole is performing, especially given that we allow the users to go in and adjust the weights, adjust the thresholds based on their preferences. But we feel it&#8217;s&#8230;after spending many hours litigating the details of the methodology, we feel it&#8217;s a pretty fair representation of just simply the weighted average growth of metrics.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E That&#8217;s a great pithy summary of what it&#8217;s displaying. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re throwing all these metrics in a blender and outputting how much the industry is growing along all these various dimensions. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see where we&#8217;re at a year from now. I don&#8217;t think we really know what it&#8217;s gonna look like. Does anybody have an expectation? Are we gonna be out of winter? Into springtime? Into summer time?

There are going to be more transactions. There are going to be more interesting types of projects that are possible and as a result I hope more developers. I see that going very well. The demand side is the crazy one. I just don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s just tied to so many external factors. Who knows what&#8217;s happening with the money supply, the global economy, oil.

So, I have no idea what will happen with the economy and potential recession, inflation, all those things including prices of any tech assets whether they be crypto or non-crypto.

Our view, as we make very clear in this report and generally throughout the years, is that a blockchain is a new type of computer that has a particularly useful application of building new networks that have a bunch of positive features. So that&#8217;s kind of the lens by which we view our investing. How can we further advance that mission and hopefully nudge the internet into a new era where we have networks that are owned and operated by communities, that are built through composability where the bulk of the money flows to the edges, to the creators and software developers who build it?

But I do think it&#8217;s important to call out this distinction because I think in the public imagination these two have been conflated. When you see politicians saying, &#8220;You know, we should ban crypto,&#8221; which is becoming kind of a meme now, I believe they&#8217;re referring to the casino aspects of it.

Some projects (like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnbatopshot.com\u002F\"\u003ENBA Top Shot\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) \u003Ci\u003Ebegan \u003C\u002Fi\u003Eas brand-blessed partnerships.

By “inside-out” we mean getting to know a project’s mission or vision; building authentic connections rooted in community participation; and thorough research and philosophical alignment well before pursuing a potential partnership. This is true whether you’re selling a service (like tooling or infrastructure) or pitching an event idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENFT communities are not monoliths; they’re unique networks that differ tremendously in their missions, products, and organizational structures. Any outreach plan should reflect these differences. So in this post, we provide a framework for web2 and traditional brands navigating web3, as well as web3 teams dipping their toes into NFT partnerships for the first time. We begin with how to do this kind of research on the NFT projects (and communities) of interest, and then dive into a few ways to approach and pitch potential partnerships.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. The foundations: From “Know Your Customer” to “Know Your Community”\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBehind many popular NFT projects are teams, products, and tens of thousands of NFT holders, but you’re just as likely to find a single artist managing a tightly knit community. Research should always take these differences into account, extending the “Know Your Customer” standard of traditional business practice to “Know Your Community.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding the operations, mission, and people (both the creators and their communities) driving a project is a critical first phase. While most projects have founders and missions that set the tone for the culture and philosophy of their communities, it’s also important to think through more practical, or functional, parameters — like organizational and legal structures — to guide outreach and efficiently work out a partnership.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[toc-embed]Understanding a project’s organizational and legal structure\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in learning about a project is finding its founder or founders. They will occasionally be the best point of contact, since most NFT projects don’t operate at a scale that warrants a specialized business development team. However, getting in touch (or even identifying) a web3 founder is often not as straightforward as looking at an “about us” page.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFounders may be anonymous, pseudonymous, or provide little information about their backgrounds beyond a Twitter handle. But even when founders choose to remain anonymous, they&#8217;re often very much involved in the direction of the project and its community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENFT communities can also vary in organizational and legal structures that can have widespread implications for a potential partnership — including how to reach out, the type of partnership available to pursue, and other parts of the process that might be easy to take for granted when working with traditional organizations. For example, a project may rely on a decentralized autonomous organization (\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F?s=dao\"\u003Eor DAO\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) for decision making without a formal legal entity; critically, projects that aren’t organized into formal legal entities may not be able to sign certain paperwork, like non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2244 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F10\u002FStructure-of-DAO-Controlled-NFT-Projects-1.png\" alt=\"model for how DAO-controlled NFT projects are structured, with NFTs and DAO-controlled IP sitting on top of blockchain networks, and below derivatives and users\" width=\"1201\" height=\"676\" \u002F\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOrganizational structures can also tell us who to reach out to, and who’s responsible for making partnership decisions (which is not always clear given the decentralized and distributed nature of DAOs).

By “inside-out” we mean getting to know a project’s mission or vision; building authentic connections rooted in community participation; and thorough research and philosophical alignment well before pursuing a potential partnership. This is true whether you’re selling a service (like tooling or infrastructure) or pitching an event idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENFT communities are not monoliths; they’re unique networks that differ tremendously in their missions, products, and organizational structures. Any outreach plan should reflect these differences. So in this post, we provide a framework for web2 and traditional brands navigating web3, as well as web3 teams dipping their toes into NFT partnerships for the first time. We begin with how to do this kind of research on the NFT projects (and communities) of interest, and then dive into a few ways to approach and pitch potential partnerships.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]1. The foundations: From “Know Your Customer” to “Know Your Community”\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBehind many popular NFT projects are teams, products, and tens of thousands of NFT holders, but you’re just as likely to find a single artist managing a tightly knit community. Research should always take these differences into account, extending the “Know Your Customer” standard of traditional business practice to “Know Your Community.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding the operations, mission, and people (both the creators and their communities) driving a project is a critical first phase. While most projects have founders and missions that set the tone for the culture and philosophy of their communities, it’s also important to think through more practical, or functional, parameters — like organizational and legal structures — to guide outreach and efficiently work out a partnership.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[toc-embed]Understanding a project’s organizational and legal structure\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in learning about a project is finding its founder or founders. They will occasionally be the best point of contact, since most NFT projects don’t operate at a scale that warrants a specialized business development team. However, getting in touch (or even identifying) a web3 founder is often not as straightforward as looking at an “about us” page.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFounders may be anonymous, pseudonymous, or provide little information about their backgrounds beyond a Twitter handle. But even when founders choose to remain anonymous, they&#8217;re often very much involved in the direction of the project and its community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENFT communities can also vary in organizational and legal structures that can have widespread implications for a potential partnership — including how to reach out, the type of partnership available to pursue, and other parts of the process that might be easy to take for granted when working with traditional organizations. For example, a project may rely on a decentralized autonomous organization (\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F?s=dao\"\u003Eor DAO\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) for decision making without a formal legal entity; critically, projects that aren’t organized into formal legal entities may not be able to sign certain paperwork, like non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2244 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F10\u002FStructure-of-DAO-Controlled-NFT-Projects-1.png\" alt=\"model for how DAO-controlled NFT projects are structured, with NFTs and DAO-controlled IP sitting on top of blockchain networks, and below derivatives and users\" width=\"1201\" height=\"676\" \u002F\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOrganizational structures can also tell us who to reach out to, and who’s responsible for making partnership decisions (which is not always clear given the decentralized and distributed nature of DAOs).

So: puzzling and problem-solving is like formulating a- an incentive design; it often has the same mixture of elegance and precision &#8212; figuring out how to make a crypto design actually work together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally agree. And puzzle design is not just about designing the medium, it&#8217;s about designing the full experience &lt;Scott: yes&gt;. So when you&#8217;re designing a puzzle, it&#8217;s not just &#8220;I made a crossword, here, solve it&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s everything contextually around how that puzzle is presented &#8212; because the puzzle is the experience that the solver has.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is often overlooked in puzzle contests in any format &#8212; where incentivization structure, the prize structure is part of the puzzle, whether you like it or not. Like in an escape room also: The fact that there is a time limit, is part of the puzzle; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; it&#8217;s not separate from the puzzles. That totally dictates how you engage with the puzzles, whether you&#8217;re taking your time; whether you&#8217;re solving as quickly as possible just to get to the answer and then moving on; or fully solving and appreciating each of the intermediate a-ha’s of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me: A big part of the style of puzzle design I do and enjoy solving is about puzzles as a type of personal expression, and encouraging &lt;Scott: yah&gt; research rabbit-holes, and sharing deep areas of knowledge and hobbies and identities and such &lt;Sonal: yess!&gt; So like I have a background as a software engineer; I&#8217;m also a violinist, I do some visual art stuff; when I design puzzles, it brings in all of these different perspectives. And the a-ha moments I create in puzzles are- whether from existing hobbies or new areas of research rabbit holes that I enjoy leading people down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in particular I think this contrasts with how people often view a specific type of puzzle-solving as influenced by &#8212; the Times crossword specifically; it’s &#8212; you can&#8217;t look things up; It&#8217;s how much you know already &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; If there&#8217;s a way to figure it out, if there&#8217;s a way to sort of piece stuff together, there certainly is more puzzle-y trivia… but trivia on its own isn&#8217;t necessarily a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don&#8217;t necessarily view trivia (in and of itself) as a type of puzzle-solving, simply because it&#8217;s you-know-it-or-you-don&#8217;t. If anything it&#8217;s the exact opposite: I&#8217;m designing the puzzle around getting you to look things up and then keep going deeper, and be four hours into researching &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; asteroid-naming conventions, and suddenly you have this discovery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly; discover this entirely new world that the puzzle introduced you to.

And… you know we tied the columns, when we could, to things that were in the news that were kind of puzzle-y, and potentially of interest to Bloomberg readers.

So in contrast to maybe a New York Times crossword, where a correctly filled in grid is the answer to the puzzle; in a puzzle hunt, if you had a crossword, it would go one step further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And that might be reading every square that has a prime number in it or something. &lt;Sonal: Got it&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;d be a clue that led you to realize, the prime numbers mattered or something.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly. Which gets to… In a crossword, you sort of know what you&#8217;re doing when you&#8217;re presented with a puzzle: You know that you have some clues, and you need to answer the clues, and fill them into a grid.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a puzzle hunt, oftentimes the puzzle is figuring out what to do: You&#8217;re presented with some information, some piece of data, some object. And, puzzle-hunt puzzles will oftentimes have (what&#8217;s called) “flavor text” accompanying them, which gives some keywords\u003Csup\u003E18\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E that you need to pay special attention to, keying in on what might be going on in the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut typically it requires: pattern observation, paying attention to small details, noticing what might be amiss, applying common techniques. You have some clues, figure out what the answers might be. Maybe some of the clues are a little bit too ambiguous to figure out the answer at first, but you fill in the ones that you know for sure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then maybe you notice that &#8212; this is just gonna be an example of a very generic, simple puzzle-hunt style puzzle &#8212; maybe you noticed that the left column of the answers, the answers are in alphabetical order; but the right column, the answers seem to be in some particular order. And then you notice that the left column maybe, are anagrams of one of the answers in the right column plus a letter. That type of wordplay is called a “transaddition”. So you match one from the left column, one to the right column; since the left column (the alphabetized ones), already has a strict ordering, you know that probably the ordering of the right column answers matters. And then maybe the extra letters spell out a clue phrase, which then clues some final word is the final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat might be the flow for &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; a really generic style of this puzzle. &lt;Sonal: Got it&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, there are things to figure out along the way; you don&#8217;t necessarily know what the later steps are &#8212; but there are layers that reveal themselves as you progress through the puzzle. And somehow you can get a final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother property\u003Csup\u003E46\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E of puzzle hunts is “metapuzzles”. At the end of the round, you metapuzzle &#8212; which, in some way uses the answers to all the individual puzzles in that round &#8212; which are called the “feeder” puzzle answers. Again this can take so so many different forms; &lt;Sonal: yah!&gt; I&#8217;m not even going to try and get into examples of that now…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are sort of two categories of metapuzzles: “shell” metapuzzles or “shell-less” metapuzzles. Shell metapuzzles means that you&#8217;re presented with some extra information for the metapuzzle. Whereas shell-less means that the metapuzzle is elegantly contained just within the answers themselves. One is not necessarily better than the other, but, it certainly can be a level more elegant if you can make a shell-less metapuzzle &#8212; where there&#8217;s that extra layer of hidden meaning contained within the answers staring you in the face the entire time. That then once you&#8217;ve solved all of these individual puzzles (that individually are cohesive satisfying experiences), you then reveal another entirely new layer of meaning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, the structure can continue on from there; there can be meta metapuzzles that combine all the metapuzzles. Metapuzzle structures can get really creative: So, they can use more than just even the answers to the feeder puzzles. They can also use some version of the mechanics to the feeder puzzles. They can use answers to feeder puzzles from previous rounds, sort of a waterfall\u002F cascade structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favorite MIT Mystery Hunt puzzle rounds &#8212; the world&#8217;s biggest annual puzzle hunt which happens at MIT annually in January; it involves thousands of participants, hundreds of puzzles; it&#8217;s all-out battle-royale of puzzles, with pulling out all the stops in terms of difficulty and depth and such &#8212; one of my all-time favorite metapuzzle structures I&#8217;ve seen was in the 2020 Mystery Hunt designed by Galactic Trendsetters.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The official team name is like &#8220;Whoosh, Galactic Trendsetters, screeeee…&#8221; right, there you go. &lt;Matthew: Yes, that one&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Nice sound effects, Scott! &lt;Scott: thank you&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The sound effects are part of their name &lt;Sonal: I love it (laughs)&gt;; I mispronounced it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut they had this one round, the nano round &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if you remember this Scott~\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E ~Oh god yah that was epic~\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E ~Yah; Where normally, you have a bunch of feeder puzzles, and then there&#8217;s a metapuzzle at the end.

So say there&#8217;s a puzzle that has 30 lines of data, and I&#8217;m getting a letter from each line; if I have two-thirds of those letters, I can probably figure out what the words it’s spelling out are. And without fully solving the puzzle, I can still figure out what the missing letters are and arrive at the final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut anyhow: You backsolve this one answer, and then solving that puzzle unlocked a sub-round for which that puzzle was the meta. And then it recursively continued forward for I think three layers or so?

But I think a bigger theme that I&#8217;m getting at here is &#8212; puzzle design has to be for a specific audience. A puzzle is not a good puzzle generally, it&#8217;s a good puzzle relative to who it&#8217;s designed to be solved by.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if I&#8217;m designing a puzzle for team-building activity for a tech company, for a bunch of software engineers, I know I can rely on a certain type of analytical thinking and communication skills, but not on knowledge of puzzle conventions. &lt;Sonal: Right&gt; But I will know that software engineers intuitively will know what puzzle indexing is, because indexing is a key concept in programming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVersus if I&#8217;m designing a puzzle hunt for an audience of puzzle hunters, &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; I can&#8217;t just design generic\u003Csup\u003E97\u003C\u002Fsup\u003Epuzzles and expect them to be interesting and thought-provoking &#8212; because those people will know all the conventions; they&#8217;ll know what to expect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, when I&#8217;m designing for that sort of audience, I&#8217;m intending to subvert their expectations relative to how they would expect the puzzles to unfold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, if I&#8217;m designing a music puzzle for an audience of musicians, I can design a-ha moments, I can design shifts in perception around getting those musicians to maybe see conventions of musical notation, or manipulate audio files in a way that is novel to them. Versus if I&#8217;m designing a music puzzle for an audience of non-musicians, I may pick something that&#8217;s a special property of music that myself as a musician, something that I want to share with those people… Some a-ha I&#8217;ve had about music; and I&#8217;ll use the structure of the puzzle to get the solvers to experience that moment on their own.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Teach!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPuzzles have this really special property &#8212; in contrast to other types of game and interaction design &#8212; where you&#8217;re not telling people what to do; you&#8217;re providing them with some materials, some experiential framing that leads them to figure out what to do on their own. And, when done properly, it sets them up for these really powerful moments of revelation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So to pick on this education note for a moment &#8212; Scott just said, it’s like teaching &#8212; and I came from the world of developmental psychology (that was my grad work); and one of the things that was very much in vogue was you know this idea of constructivism and how students learn. It was an NSF grant, National Science Foundation grant that I was on about early numeracy in preschoolers; and it was how you harness children&#8217;s natural numeracy and skills, before they even have any formal systems for learning math.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, what was super fascinating about it is the philosophy of this Russian cognitive psychologist &#8212; Vygotsky, who wrote a book called \u003Cem\u003EMind in Society\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; and one of the key concepts that comes up is this idea of “scaffolding”… as a way to set up the learning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the ideal teacher essentially &#8212; in this context (and this applies in Montessori, Reggio Emilia, lots of school practices) &#8212; they essentially set up a scaffolding in the environment, that this child or student or person then explores, to construct their own learning. And that&#8217;s literally just kinda like what you just said and how &lt;Scott: One hundred percent&gt; it maps to puzzle design. And it&#8217;s like what you said Scott about education, it&#8217;s like teaching.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s exactly it; and we should both talk about the sort of philosophies of puzzle design. But for me, this scaffolding component is absolutely central &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want people to be able to make discoveries right; you want a discovery to feel like an accomplishment and a major a-ha… But you also want to sort of enable them to make constant forward progress in some sense, right. Like it&#8217;s okay to get stuck sometimes or it&#8217;s okay to you know be thinking like where is this puzzle taking me &#8212; but it shouldn&#8217;t be a way\u002F in the sense that you&#8217;re stuck in that like you wanna quit. It&#8217;s you&#8217;re stuck, but you&#8217;re so intrigued that you have to, and you want to, understand and you wanna enable yourself to have that level-up &#8212; that it sort of continues to pull you forward even if it&#8217;s by tiny, little, marginal bits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the other thing: You have to really engage with the content of the idea or of the experience as you solve; like solving a puzzle is by nature active.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right, it&#8217;s not a passive activity; you&#8217;re not just like a recipient of a one-way dissemination &lt;Scott: Yah&gt; &#8212; or you&#8217;re receiving it in a very deeply immersive way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. Puzzle hunts and alternate reality games are especially intriguing because they are fertile ground for really densely layered puzzle architectures &#8212; contrasting with other types of puzzles where, you sort of know what you&#8217;re supposed to do; it&#8217;s more figuring out how to do it, than figuring out what to do, &lt;Sonal: mmm… mhm&gt; and then sort of peeling back layer upon layer. So what you were saying with scaffolding is absolutely spot on. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd because there’s more intricate architecture &#8212; because there is more scaffolding to sort of implicitly contained puzzle experience &#8212; there are so many opportunities for unexpected moments along the journey.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know actually just on that note, like, what strikes me about what you&#8217;re saying there Matthew… is: It&#8217;s not just like learning but how to learn; it&#8217;s creating these systems in your head.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it reminds me so much again of the work when I was in grad school in developmental psychology, and cognitive psychology because it&#8217;s also very closely tied to this other hot topic back then &#8212; which was metacognition, and like awareness of your own mind, and how you think and navigate a system &#8212; And of course this then connects to even the interesting question of what happens when computer AI solves puzzles right; like we&#8217;ve talked about this actually on my old podcast (the a16z Podcast), a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Ftag\u002Fdeepmind\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enumber of episodes on AlphaGo\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and how humans can learn differently from computers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The computer-solving-puzzles point is really fascinating, because I make a distinction in puzzle design between the solution and the answer &lt;Scott: yes&gt; &lt;Sonal: mhm…!&gt; &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is sort of the flag at the end of the puzzle: It&#8217;s the answer word or phrase that means that you&#8217;ve solved it; it&#8217;s the grid-is-correct notification you get when you correctly solve a crossword; it means that, yes, you&#8217;ve reached the intended end point of the puzzle. Whereas the solution is the intended path getting there. And what really matters about the puzzle (generally speaking, of course there are exceptions to this), is the \u003Cem\u003Esolution\u003C\u002Fem\u003E not so much the answer. The answer confirms that you followed the correct solution path &#8212; but, what really matters is&#8211; “it&#8217;s the journey, not the destination”… in puzzle form.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the solution path is sort of a dance between the solver and the designer. It&#8217;s in part architected when the puzzle is designed &#8212; but in part played out uniquely by each solver &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;, as they circle their way around the answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It’s part of why it&#8217;s fun to do in teams, right; it&#8217;s a lot like engineering a new piece of software or something &#8212; you have people with different backgrounds, and experiences, and intuitions, and expertise &#8212; that together can sort of crack even the very complicated or extremely difficult puzzles and puzzle hunts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know footnote, for example: I have a perfect record of solving every “We Didn&#8217;t Start the Fire”-related &lt;Sonal chuckles&gt; puzzle that has been in Mystery Hunts since I started competing in Mystery Hunts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, the reason &#8220;We Didn&#8217;t Start the Fire&#8221; crops up frequently is &#8212; remember Matthew was explaining this idea that like you need to somehow get to a word or phrase in the answer or something? &#8212; And he mentioned this idea of an ordering, right, like maybe one column, everything&#8217;s in alphabetical order, or one thing and they&#8217;re not; and that not in alphabetical order column might tell you which order you wanna put the input data into or something &#8211;With really serious puzzlers, you&#8217;re often looking for a way to induce an ordering that is not like something as simple as alphabetical order, &lt;Sonal: mm&gt; or periodic table order, or something like a standard way of putting things in an order…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it&#8217;s useful to have lists of things in canonical orders &#8212; where, if you don&#8217;t know what the list means, like if you don&#8217;t recognize the list, you might have to think a little bit to figure out that this is the list of objects.

So, often, that&#8217;s a trick that gets you to the solution faster.

In the context of a competition, when something is framed as a competitive puzzle hunt and you need to call on this final answer &#8212; sure, it&#8217;s marked as solved; but solving the puzzle for me really is about experiencing that shift in perception.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah. Love that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And this gets into (another thing that Scott mentioned before), which is that shift in perception needs to be satisfying. That it needs to be a proportionately satisfying payoff for the solver, to make them want to go through this process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you really put in the legwork, feeling like you&#8217;re making progress &#8212; not just grinding and not getting anywhere &#8212; but when you finally overcome the final hurdle, it&#8217;s all the more satisfying because of the work that you&#8217;ve put in. When that work is designed in such a way so that it does feel like it&#8217;s leading into the final answer, instead of just sort of fizzling off at the end. When done well can be this really climactic moment of revelation. &lt;Sonal: Yeah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis gets into another point, which is: A puzzle needs to be designed such that what it gates&#8211; So, gating in puzzle design or escape room design, game design generally &#8212; means, there&#8217;s something preventing you from accessing further content: So in the case of an escape room, it might be a padlock that you have to put a number into that opens a chest that has a new item you need. Or in the case of a puzzle hunt, it might be typing in your answer to a puzzle, which in turn unlocks a new round of puzzles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gating needs to be conceived such that it&#8217;s worth fully solving the puzzle, it&#8217;s worth &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; getting a satisfying experience instead of being inclined to sidestep that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, to give a simple example from a sort of escape room-type mindset: If you have a padlock on a chest, the a-ha of the puzzle aligns with the satisfaction of the lock popping open, and then you move on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, say you had four separate puzzles that each gave you one digit &#8212; in addition to it not being very satisfying to just get a digit from zero through nine from a puzzle &#8212; It also means that when you get down to that last puzzle, it&#8217;s not a matter of if I fully solve this one puzzle that has a cohesive mechanic, but rather, do I go through the process of solving this last puzzle? Or do I do what&#8217;s probably less effort of just spinning the last dial?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you&#8217;re sort of gating yourself instead of the game gating you. So, the stakes for the a-ha feel less real because you&#8217;re sort of breaking the immersion. It really has to be worth it for you to solve that last puzzle &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; if that requires more effort than the other path of just brute-forcing it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis applies to competitive framing as well: Does it make sense to fully solve the puzzle; are you borrowing the answer from a different team who you happen to hear the answer from. What types of behavior are you incentivizing? And, is the path of least resistance &#8212; is that the experience you want solvers to take? What types of behavior at each possible point throughout the experience, are you setting them up for?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So talking about incentive design and behavioral design &lt;Matthew: yah&gt;, and this, obviously maps onto crypto &#8212; given what we&#8217;ve talked about so far, taxonomy of puzzles, some of the mechanics, some of the design, some of the software analogies &#8212; how would you think about this in the context of crypto?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well first of all, it&#8217;s very similar to the intellectual challenge of designing an incentive scheme. Like how is your token going to work; what is it going to do or enable your community to do? What will happen as people start to engage with it; how will the experience evolve? Like these are all the same types of questions that you sort of formulate when you&#8217;re constructing a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike I often think of a token system as being sort of a big community puzzle environment, that&#8217;s set up by the project creators, and enabling it to evolve and build upon itself in exactly the way that like a collaborative puzzle-solving exercise works. And that means that as the designer that you have to think about all of these things that Matthew was just talking about in terms of puzzle design: You want it to drive incentives that make people excited about engaging and exploring the boundaries of what your design can do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also wanna make the thing feel intuitive &#8212; even if it&#8217;s new; right something can be novel and yet sort of be intuitive at every step of engagement &#8212; And if you&#8217;re a crypto project that&#8217;s trying to reach broad consumers, you&#8217;re facing very much the same design challenge that Matthew and I face when we write puzzles for general audiences. It turns out: you can get people in very very general audiences to solve incredibly difficult puzzles… even thinking going in that they&#8217;re not gonna be able to, if you design the architecture of the puzzle in a way that sort of leads them along, and then the unlocks start to appear, and then they gain confidence and understanding of the structure of the puzzle as they go, and it can get harder. Similarly, that&#8217;s very much how a crypto project &#8212; especially one that&#8217;s trying to reach an audience that&#8217;s not already deep in the weeds of crypto, but rather that is going to engage with it and sort of use it as an exploration and a path in…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then similarly, this point about audiences, right &#8212; the idea that the same thing will be interpreted very differently by two audiences with different experiences and different backgrounds &#8212; this crops up in crypto design all the time, too. Even just the interfaces through which we interact with crypto, right: Are you using a custodial wallet or a non-custodial wallet; are you minting on a website, or are you minting through the contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, you see you see NFT launches that are only minted through contract. And why is that? The aesthetic of what the project is trying to accomplish, they essentially want to limit to people who have the technical sophistication to access it in this way: It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re trying to be a closed community for the sake of just being insular, rather, the technical complexity of joining is helping screen for the audience that they think will actually appreciate what they&#8217;re doing. &lt;Sonal: Yeah…&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo in a puzzle hunt, often the first puzzles or the first round of puzzles are much more accessible than the others. And then if you find that the environment and the ecosystem being set up by the project is one that feels right, then you might start working really hard and be willing to like put much more effort in. And all of that pulls back to a design problem on behalf of the creator &#8212; right, if you&#8217;re creating this project, you want to enable people to dip their toe in and then discover &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; they want to swim and then you know also immerse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, that intro round really is a welcome &#8212; but it&#8217;s also about building trust in the integrity of the design. It&#8217;s also an opportunity to level the playing field just a little bit. &lt;Scott: yes&gt; So, when people are newer to puzzles, they may not be as familiar with the conventions &#8212; or even just the conventions of a particular designer or design team &#8212; and those newer puzzles are opportunities to present the atomic elements of whatever puzzle world people are being presented with. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, like in a video game where you&#8217;re maybe taught some basic mechanics, and then you&#8217;re throwing variation after variation and hybrids of those variations &#8212; similarly with puzzle mechanics, you&#8217;re introducing people to the general style and aesthetics and what they can do, what they can&#8217;t do: Are the puzzles going totally outside of the box, and expecting you to dive into the source code, and use real-world components? Are they all just contained within PDF? Are you expected to maybe interact with other teams who have different types of data than you?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey&#8217;re establishing the rules of the world that you&#8217;re playing in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Which that is also a component of crypto projects &#8212; Every crypto project you&#8217;re entering into, by conceptual definition, has a set of rules, and ecosystem constraints, and features that you have to learn as a new entrant.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so when you&#8217;re onboarding new people, you have to sort of help them understand like what your ecosystem feels like, and what its boundaries are, like what it contains, and how it might evolve.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s funny this reminds me so much of the art of onboarding &lt;Scott: yes&gt; &#8212; into any new open-source community, and any community in general &#8212; But particularly in open source, there&#8217;s a whole school of thought \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2017\u002F04\u002F08\u002Fculture-open-source-community\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eabout how\u003C\u002Fa\u003E the attention you pay proactively to really having good onboarding documentation, mentoring, partnerships, people who can kinda hold your hand, guide you, shepherd you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, we might be talking about a nuance in puzzles where people might actually like solving it themselves; but to your guys&#8217; point, they don&#8217;t wanna feel like they&#8217;re just flitting about in something that&#8217;s just really rough and raggedly designed and they have to like slog through it. They wanna get the intentionality (to Matthew&#8217;s point), that they are in a trusted place, where someone has intentionally put things together for them; &lt;yah&gt; so I think that&#8217;s a really great analogy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne quick thing: The two of you are kinda dancing in a really interesting tension between both the idea of insider access, and the idea of accessibility &lt;Scott: yes&gt; It&#8217;s almost like a bit of a paradox &#8212; Okay there&#8217;s a little signaling to your like-minded, quote-&#8220;community&#8221;, whatever it is, it could be cut across whatever level &#8212; a certain domain knowledge, a certain specialty, a certain interest; it could just be puzzles in the meta. Or, there&#8217;s also the sense of, well, how do we also make it not too insular and inaccessible to people joining? &lt;Scott: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause honestly when I hear you guys talk, it feels extremely intricate\u003Csup\u003E73\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E and internal &#8212; and frankly just to draw the analogy to crypto &#8212; that also comes up quite a bit with people feeling like they&#8217;re entering into a crypto community. So I&#8217;d love you to kinda break down how this works in the puzzle world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally; this is such a great question.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So I think this touches on a few things. One is, how to approach difficulty in puzzle design. Because difficult puzzles can be fun, but it&#8217;s a lot harder to design an easy novel elegant puzzle than it is to design a difficult puzzle. And of course it&#8217;s challenging to design a difficult puzzle that is also elegant and satisfying… But the easiest type of puzzle to design is a very very difficult puzzle that absolutely nobody can solve and nobody would have fun solving. And, we see plenty of people doing this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, one of the safeguards against this is of course, “playtesting” &#8212; where when you come up with a puzzle idea, implement it, you don&#8217;t just release it to your solvers; you show it to some playtesters first who are a curated community of people. When I&#8217;m designing a project, depending on the audience and timeline and budget, I&#8217;ll have anywhere from one or two playtesters to dozens across multiple rounds &#8212; from people playtesting sort of a stub of the initial idea, to a fully implemented draft, to final proofing the sort of post-prod, fully artified version of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I&#8217;m designing a puzzle hunt for a crypto community for instance, it&#8217;s likely that those people aren&#8217;t going to be familiar with puzzle hunts already. They aren&#8217;t going to know all of these conventions and all of the sort of in-the-weeds nuances that Scott and I are discussing here. And, to some extent they don&#8217;t have to, but to some extent we also need to meet them halfway: We need to recognize what their behaviors are going to be, what their initial perceptions are going to be, how to properly engage them and really get them excited about exploring this world in the way that we hope for them to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it&#8217;s important to playtest with a representative sampling of the type of community who is actually going to be playing the game. So, I have (for my own puzzle work) a private Discord server where I have a bunch of puzzle people who regularly playtest my puzzles, give me their feedback, make sure the actual puzzle mechanics work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then when I&#8217;m figuring out the exact framing of the puzzle, how it&#8217;s going to be presented, the flavor text, the hints that accompany the puzzle, I&#8217;m not playtesting with those people still &#8212; I&#8217;m finding some people who are of a similar demographic, similar background to the actual people who are going to be solving my hunt. And, that allows me to sort of gauge the way the puzzles are going to be received, before they&#8217;re actually out in the field. And if things go terribly wrong then, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the hunt is going to be wrong, it is going to be totally broken; &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; I can adjust accordingly in advance. &lt;Sonal: that’s great&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is similar to software development cycles as well: &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; We would never release a piece of software without unit-testing everything, and integration testing everything, and making sure that it fully works at all stages. We would never commit one final code change and be like oh it worked in the last stage &lt;Sonal: yah… totally&gt; so it probably still works; we would run all of our tests again before releasing it. And the same applies to experience design and its many forms, and especially to puzzle design, where, we are actively encouraging solvers to pay attention to every last detail to get in the mindset that anything could be part of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… in an elegant puzzle-hunt style puzzle, everything sort of is part of the puzzle. We&#8217;re not adding in random text that seems puzzle-y but actually means nothing. There&#8217;s a lot of attention paid to making sure that any actual noise in the puzzle couldn&#8217;t be interpreted as meaningful noise. &lt;Sonal: right!&gt; So that means if we expect the solvers to put a list of data in a new ordering based on some property of the data, we intentionally put the data initially in some ordering that&#8217;s clearly not the final ordering. So like I was saying previously, that can be alphabetical ordering, that can be a bullet-point list rather than a numbered list; various things to signal the type of behavior we expect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what this all translates to in terms of access to the community, is: Not that we should design easier puzzles, but rather that we should give accessible points to people and welcome them into this community. Where, by the final puzzle, the solvers are solving things that they didn&#8217;t realize they were able to &#8212; they&#8217;re presented with something that would&#8217;ve seemed utterly impenetrable at the beginning… but by the end through the way in which the game has guided them to build up their abilities they realize that yes, they&#8217;re able to do this as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this actually gets at one of the biggest differences between newer puzzlers, and people who are familiar with these styles of puzzles (or any styles of puzzles really) &#8212; which is: Simply just the willingness to try things. Oftentimes when I&#8217;m running puzzles of any level of difficulty for people who are new to puzzles, they&#8217;ll prematurely come to me or whoever is running the game, for hints. And of course, prior to telling them what to do, we&#8217;ll say, &#8220;What have you tried so far?&#8221; And oftentimes they&#8217;ll make a correct observation; they&#8217;ll describe part of the solution, and then I&#8217;ll reply &#8220;Well, did you try that?&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so many times I hear the response, &#8220;No, because I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would be correct.&#8221; And it&#8217;s that willingness to just try that really differentiates those more novice solvers from more experienced solvers who are willing to go down a rabbit hole, see if it works… and then embrace the fact that even when it doesn&#8217;t work, they perhaps learn something interesting along the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s so fascinating ‘cause earlier when you talked about the &#8220;payoff&#8221; &#8212; that was like a word that I use in editorial all the time &#8212; because a lot of people have these religious debates about how long a piece should be… &lt;Matthew: mhm&gt; and I always say length is arbitrary to me, quite frankly; it&#8217;s really about the “payoff proportional” to what you&#8217;re putting in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, editorially, when you just described that like the designer has to put in these sort of intermediate things, and things to kinda bring people along – and-and you again, reinforced this idea of trust &#8212; it made me think of a very editorial concept that I use all the time when it comes to religious debates between quote-&#8220;dumbing things down&#8221; or not (‘cause a lot of people say, oh technical content, oh we have to simplify it) and I&#8217;m just like, it&#8217;s not like an either\u002For, you can actually have both: as long as you have good “signposting” to bring people along.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, this insider\u002Foutsider piece is very salient… coming back to how you think about this from the perspective of crypto, a lot of crypto communities are mostly &#8212; by nature at the moment, right, mostly made up of people who are insiders because they&#8217;ve overcome tremendous technical hurdles to gain access in the first place &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a custodial crypto wallet and you&#8217;re just collecting you know NBA Top Shot NFTs or something like that, you learned a bunch of stuff: You&#8217;ve signed up for a piece of software; you&#8217;ve overcome a bunch of different steps to get in; and you already have some intuition for the lingo, for the lay of the land, for the types of things you might be doing. And for what the crypto actually is: Like what are these digital assets that you&#8217;re trading, or like what are these protocols you&#8217;re interfacing with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one thing is the people who have all done that have a shared text, right &#8212; it&#8217;s very much like puzzlers right, you have this set of shared knowledge and understanding of some basic conventions and features of what a thing might be &#8212; But by the same token, what&#8217;s often most intriguing or exciting are using and remixing all of those ideas in new and powerful ways; right, new, powerful, and hopefully elegant ways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd meanwhile, if you&#8217;re someone who is outside &#8212; right as you were both just saying, like the signposting, and the simple access points to start to understand what&#8217;s going on, are really really important &#8212; and the more complex the eventual exercise is, the more individual signposting steps you need, the more sort of components;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI really connected to Matthew&#8217;s description that first-time puzzlers often have really good instincts, but are afraid to try… And like crypto, because you know still so much of it is so hard to navigate, you could accidentally pay a massive gas fee while trying to do a transaction that doesn&#8217;t even succeed; like there&#8217;s lots of stuff that can go wrong: There&#8217;s the same sort of trepidation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it&#8217;s really important if you&#8217;re building &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re building something that is unusual, and novel, and exciting in all the ways that a new type of puzzle might be &#8212; it&#8217;s all the more incumbent on the builder to provide those sorts of signposting and create the trust and understanding with your user that enables them to enter, and explore, and gain confidence to explore\u003Csup\u003E25\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that&#8217;s an incentive design challenge, right; and that&#8217;s exactly what you have to do when you&#8217;re launching a crypto project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Absolutely. One of the most important principles is that puzzles are experiences, and we need to design them as experiences, not things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo looking at other experiences, a restaurant for instance: When you go to a nice restaurant, your experience starts not when you get served your plate of food &#8212; but from the moment you go to that restaurant&#8217;s website, and make a reservation; and look at the menu; figure out how to get in the door, get seated, order, your conversation with the waiter, how you pay for the food; the entire thing is part of your dining experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, a puzzle experience starts the first touch point of however you&#8217;re engaging with the puzzle &#8212; whether that&#8217;s signing up for a puzzle hunt, or getting an email about a promotional game that an NFT community is putting on. All of this affects your mindset, your motivations going into the game, and really affects how you solve the puzzle, how you experience the puzzles themselves. Those things in my opinion really are inseparable. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, you can design the most amazing crossword puzzle, and if the website that checks your answers breaks while solving it, that&#8217;s a bad puzzle experience. If, halfway through the puzzle you notice a typo in it, and you don’t get a response from the people running the puzzle hunt for three hours; that&#8217;s part of the puzzle experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can&#8217;t really distinguish between the quality of what the puzzle could have been (if it ran perfectly), and the experience you actually had with it. Your feeling of when you solve the puzzle, are you reveling in the victory, or are you worried that you didn&#8217;t win the prize so did it matter??\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This is exactly the experience of being part of an NFT community. If the community does things that don&#8217;t match your expectations in one way or another, they set up a story, and then there&#8217;s like a second like spinoff project, and there&#8217;s no sort of aesthetic sensibility…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne that did it really incredibly recently is Chain Runners &#8212; and I&#8217;m a holder, I&#8217;m a very involved member of the community (so like all biases to be clear, and this is not financial advice, of course) &#8212; but they did something really cool that I liked: So their genesis collection was these sort of pixelated, two-dimensional, characters; you know very sci-fi, cyberpunk characters. And they just launched a three-dimensional, metaverse-ready instantiation of these same types of characters (the Chain Runners). And for the experience of minting the Chain Runners XR (this follow-up collection), normally, when you mint an NFT, you just go to a website or you go to the contract, potentially, and you press some buttons, and then the NFT gets added to your wallet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere… a big part of the story was this emergence from 2-D to 3-D. And, the minting website literally took you into a 3-D world: So, you walked to the computer where you access the mint process. And then once you did the mint, it took you through a tunnel, and like now you&#8217;re in a 3-D mini escape room that you could explore (shoutouts to Nav who did most of the development; and I guess footnote disclosure: I had a little bit of influence on the puzzle design for the escape room).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, then when you solved the escape room, it gave you a code that you could bring back to the Discord server, and it would give you access to a special channel just for the people who ‘d sort of played the full mint experience through solving all the puzzles. It was totally immersive &#8212; you were immersed in almost a video game experience &#8212; but then, it turned out that the game was self-aware: It knew the experience of being a Chain Runner is not just your metaverse immersion, but also the experience with the community in the Discord, and pulls back to something that you take out of this three-dimensional world… that shows the game world and the real world are one and the same, that sort of there&#8217;s a semi-permeable membrane between the two somehow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This actually makes me think, how much puzzles apply so much to token-gated communities, and any other token-gated events; like there’s so many ways to bridge the physical and digital &lt;Scott: exactly&gt; there, as well as in going through tiering to show \u003Cem\u003Ecommitment\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. &lt;Scott: yup&gt; Because the whole point again, is skin in the game and proportional &#8212; not to necessarily financial investment of things &#8212; but actually your contributions, your work, your time, your interest; like that&#8217;s how you know people wanna be in the community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right! I mean people spent literally hours solving this escape-room game in order to gain access to this secret Discord channel. And it was incredible to think of this, realization, right: In the mint experience, people usually pop in and pop out; you&#8217;re talking a minute, you know if you sped up the gas enough, it might be seconds. Whereas here, it became this transformation of the two-dimensional to the three-dimensional world that then gives you something for the outside world as well. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd all of this fits very coherently and intuitively in the mythos of the world the Chain Runners are setting up. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; If instead, the secondary collection had been, I don&#8217;t know, renaissance fair characters or weird like cartoon animals &#8212; like nothing wrong with renaissance character NFTs, nothing wrong with cartoon animal NFTs &#8212; but they would be jarring in the experience of this cyberpunk world. Whereas in the cyberpunk world, the Discord is part of the cyberpunk world too, right; it all sort of comes together and forms a really coherent single piece.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Fantastic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so a question I&#8217;ve been dying to ask you guys throughout this episode, which is who designs the puzzle, like who is the designer. And is the puzzle architect &#8212; like you know, what&#8217;s his name from Hunger Games; I was thinking of (ohmygosh, I forgot his name, the Philip Hoffman character in the movie version but, he had some kinda Greek name) &#8212; but anyway:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn crypto, we have this unique challenge-slash \u002F opportunity of it being decentralized &#8212; even though there are people who have more stakes or are the original creators or have unique IP rights or various things &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Ewho is the creator? \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMatthew made the analogy that this is like software design, and both of you guys have said this; and to me, it strikes me as a very opinionated form of software design. Even if you have it revealing itself in gates, and various forms, it still is sort of almost pre-decided, &lt;Scott: mm&gt; and it made me think again of this notion of like smart contracts, and even formal verification: Like you put the thing out the world, you don&#8217;t get to necessarily edit it after the fact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, I wondered how does and does that not play out as analogies with puzzles and crypto; and, are there cases of successful puzzles where they are actually modified once they&#8217;ve been created, in real-time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh gosh… that is such a great analogy I&#8217;ve never thought of before &#8212; yeah, a puzzle is basically a smart contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat you design and experience, that should proceed in certain ways, and like has boundary conditions and things can happen outside the boundaries, but basically you&#8217;re helping people follow a path where all the components of the path are locked in up front. &lt;Sonal: Encoded!&gt; If you get something wrong &#8212; if you like leave a red herring that&#8217;s really confusing, that people might get lost and sort of fall off the path, and you usually don&#8217;t want to be in the position of retconning (of having to go back and remove a red herring or fix something) &#8212; ideally, it all gets locked in up front, it&#8217;s a smart contract, and then people explore all of the affordances and possibilities of the contract as they go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This leads into another distinction I like to make in puzzle design which is that between “clueing” and “hinting” &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, clues represent the integral, baked-in information needed to solve the puzzle. So a clue is something that is included with the puzzle, that you couldn&#8217;t take it away and be left with a complete puzzle. (Maybe you could still solve it by an arbitrary leap of logic, but the clue structure is really what allows the puzzle to make sense, that allows everything to lock in and be elegantly cohesive.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHinting, in contrast, is what allows you to dynamically adapt to a variety of solving behavior. It acknowledges that different people may get stuck in a certain way of thinking, or not be familiar with something: the puzzle is referring to a specific video game that isn&#8217;t as easily googleable as the designer thought, and the hint allows people who aren&#8217;t familiar with that video game reference to make that connection too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut: When we design a puzzle, we need to take into account both the static and dynamic guardrails for the experience, signposting for the experience &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; &#8212; both how we guide people to solve puzzle on the core path; and how we keep them along the intended experience, if they&#8217;re passing that “threshold of frustration”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E We&#8217;re not here to design puzzles that no one&#8217;s ever gonna be able to solve, right. Some people think the goal is actually to design puzzles that are hard &#8212; and that&#8217;s totally not the goal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This actually relates back to another extension of what I was saying previously about difficulty, which is &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I design a puzzle for different types of audiences, whether it&#8217;s designing a custom puzzle for a specific individual, for a proposal; versus for teams of 3 to 5 people with 200 teams solving at once; versus a 2000-person community solving an ARG and all uniting together to tackle puzzles (And oftentimes it&#8217;s harder to test that experience because I don&#8217;t have a group of 2000 people working together testing a puzzle).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, I approach difficulty very differently, and I approach how precisely I&#8217;m going to clue something differently. I don&#8217;t want the puzzle to be solved within minutes of its release. And at the same time, I don&#8217;t want the a-has to be completely arcane, and random, and unsatisfying. They still need to adhere to the principles of good puzzle design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know it&#8217;s interesting because &#8212; I know you joked earlier Matthew that you don&#8217;t really know games; and I did actually, growing up; I grew up on Atari games as a young child &lt;Matthew: Nice&gt; &#8212; but, one thing keeps coming up, this idea of difficulty\u002F tiering &#8212; I do wanna reference a popular law that came out of the Atari world and Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari, which was:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat games should be “easy to learn but difficult to master”. I&#8217;m just curious if you guys have any thoughts, just this general principle of “Nolan&#8217;s law”, and how that does and doesn&#8217;t apply in this context of puzzles and\u002For crypto design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah I think mastery is an interesting concept when it comes to puzzle hunts. Because, there oftentimes isn&#8217;t the same type of linear, incremental mastery that you see in videogame &lt;Sonal: a game, yah&gt; puzzles, for instance &#8212; once you cross the threshold of a specific puzzle (of knowing how it works), you know how it works; there&#8217;s no going back.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that certainly may influence your knowledge of when approaching any future puzzles of being able to recognize, “Oh I&#8217;ve seen this mechanic before”. But it&#8217;s not necessarily about iterating through a level and finding the best way to solve it, per se.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut: There&#8217;s sort of a “meta mastery” where you&#8217;re building up your skills &#8212; and “skills” not just in terms of recognizing mechanics, and having better-honed logical abilities &#8212; it&#8217;s also knowing your own behavior, the sort of psychological mastery of how you approach solving puzzles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… this actually gets to one of the properties of really broadly impactful puzzle design &#8212; that I somewhat rarely see but often happens accidentally &#8212; which is: Some of the best puzzles stay with you outside of the experience of solving the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd: It can also apply to yourself; it can apply to even just identifying the puzzles in the world around you. And, this actually relates back to what we were saying earlier about the difference between behavior of newer puzzle solvers versus more experienced solvers…  So, puzzles are about creating meaning from noise, from chaos. And through this, we really are telling a narrative; we are telling a cohesive story.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well I don&#8217;t know if it applies, but Loot and the derivatives that the community co-created &#8212; that&#8217;s a case where, there is like this sense of unfolding, but what&#8217;s really fascinating is undoing a lot of classic narrative construction. Because it is being created by the community, &lt;mhm&gt; and then they&#8217;re putting a lore around it. I think it&#8217;s something we see a lot more in crypto because of the decentralized nature of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s really interesting; you know there are memes that take on form in crypto, and the exact same thing happens in the puzzle community &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike, there&#8217;s a puzzle type that was invented where somebody came up with this puzzle format; and the original one I think was just called Duck Konundrum &#8212; That&#8217;s right, Matthew, right? Like, it was just called Duck Konundrum?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah by Dan Katz I believe, in a Mystery Hunt many years ago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. So they introduced this puzzle called &#8220;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fpuzzles.mit.edu\u002F2000\u002Fset5\u002F6\u002FPuzzle.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDuck Konundrum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&#8220;, in which you get rules out of order, and you have to put them in order and then sort of step through all of them &#8212; It&#8217;s like getting a computer program in shards, and having to figure out you know the unique way in which the shards make coherent sense. And what&#8217;s fun about it is: lots of different sequences almost make sense. And then you get to the last one you&#8217;re like, Oh wait no I can&#8217;t- I now can&#8217;t use the last shard &#8212; like the n-minus-one shard has got me to a position that the last shard can&#8217;t act upon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so you’re constantly trying to reorganize this thing in sort of like a meta-logic puzzle somehow. And this was so popular, that people started riffing off of this format, and now it&#8217;s called a “Duck Konundrum” &#8212; like you&#8217;ll open up a puzzle and be like ohmygosh, it&#8217;s another Duck Konundrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s kinda what happened, I think, with releasing bits of Loot. &lt;Scott: Totally!&gt; The community was like they&#8217;d come in at midnight and be like, &#8220;What does this mean,&#8221; and kinda try to figure it out together, you know.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And then these things sort of establish memes, within communities that then start crossing over across communities… And so you can introduce like a new central meme. Like some of Dom&#8217;s work, created a new way of designing an NFT project, that others then started building on, and reformatting, and remixing in different ways. That&#8217;s exactly what happens with puzzles as well. And Duck Konundrums are a perfect example of this…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou now even see ones where there are metareferences made to the duck &#8212; but you know it&#8217;s about alligators or something &#8212; but somehow there&#8217;s a duck that appears midway through the story, and you&#8217;re like wait oh I get it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. Puzzle hunts are deeply a community that constantly is riffing on their discoveries, and the way that they&#8217;re subverting expectations\u003Csup\u003E35\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E of solvers is by referencing previous things and then doing something slightly different.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd like we were saying before about how to welcome people to this community, it&#8217;s by being self-aware of how it&#8217;s so self-referential, and inviting people into the community &#8212; without expectations of needing to go so deeply &lt;Sonal: yes!&gt; but rather distilling the key experiential architecture, for people who people who don&#8217;t know or need all the context.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes exactly; it&#8217;s inclusion, not exclusion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, that’s a great note to end on; thank you both so much for joining this special bonus holiday-ish episode of “web3 with a16z”; we’ll resume our regular programming with the next episode.

It&#8217;s very much allowing the experience to periodically evolve &#8212; sometimes through the user interactions, and sometimes through new discoveries. So: puzzling and problem-solving is like formulating a- an incentive design; it often has the same mixture of elegance and precision &#8212; figuring out how to make a crypto design actually work together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally agree. And puzzle design is not just about designing the medium, it&#8217;s about designing the full experience &lt;Scott: yes&gt;. So when you&#8217;re designing a puzzle, it&#8217;s not just &#8220;I made a crossword, here, solve it&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s everything contextually around how that puzzle is presented &#8212; because the puzzle is the experience that the solver has.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is often overlooked in puzzle contests in any format &#8212; where incentivization structure, the prize structure is part of the puzzle, whether you like it or not. Like in an escape room also: The fact that there is a time limit, is part of the puzzle; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; it&#8217;s not separate from the puzzles. That totally dictates how you engage with the puzzles, whether you&#8217;re taking your time; whether you&#8217;re solving as quickly as possible just to get to the answer and then moving on; or fully solving and appreciating each of the intermediate a-ha’s of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me: A big part of the style of puzzle design I do and enjoy solving is about puzzles as a type of personal expression, and encouraging &lt;Scott: yah&gt; research rabbit-holes, and sharing deep areas of knowledge and hobbies and identities and such &lt;Sonal: yess!&gt; So like I have a background as a software engineer; I&#8217;m also a violinist, I do some visual art stuff; when I design puzzles, it brings in all of these different perspectives. And the a-ha moments I create in puzzles are- whether from existing hobbies or new areas of research rabbit holes that I enjoy leading people down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in particular I think this contrasts with how people often view a specific type of puzzle-solving as influenced by &#8212; the Times crossword specifically; it’s &#8212; you can&#8217;t look things up; It&#8217;s how much you know already &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; If there&#8217;s a way to figure it out, if there&#8217;s a way to sort of piece stuff together, there certainly is more puzzle-y trivia… but trivia on its own isn&#8217;t necessarily a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don&#8217;t necessarily view trivia (in and of itself) as a type of puzzle-solving, simply because it&#8217;s you-know-it-or-you-don&#8217;t. If anything it&#8217;s the exact opposite: I&#8217;m designing the puzzle around getting you to look things up and then keep going deeper, and be four hours into researching &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; asteroid-naming conventions, and suddenly you have this discovery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly; discover this entirely new world that the puzzle introduced you to. And hilariously, this is how I got into NFTs, originally… &lt;Sonal: Oh! Say more!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, for a couple of years (so starting early in the pandemic), Bloomberg had me write a mostly-weekly \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Fstorythreads\u002F2021-03-21\u002Fkominers-s-conundrums-a-treasure-trove-of-puzzles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle column\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. And… you know we tied the columns, when we could, to things that were in the news that were kind of puzzle-y, and potentially of interest to Bloomberg readers. And crypto is of course highly of interest to Bloomberg readers, and so we actually did two puzzles around NFTs:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne right after the Beeple sale &#8212; NFTs feel really puzzle-y, right; like &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; you&#8217;ve got this art that&#8217;s in the open, but it&#8217;s cryptographically secured; and there&#8217;s a bunch of puzzles that are about solving different sorts of codes, or cryptosystems. And so I did a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fopinion\u002Farticles\u002F2021-02-28\u002Fkominers-s-conundrums-the-most-cryptic-piece-of-art-in-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle\u003C\u002Fa\u003E &#8211;the story was: This new art is in the open; but the address is hidden, can you locate it?

And around the time I was reading a New Yorker article about the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and I was like oh wow these feel really puzzle-y too. And I went to my editor I was like &#8220;Look can we do a second one on NFTs around these \u003Cem\u003Echaracters\u003C\u002Fem\u003E; like everyone&#8217;s playing these characters.” And he sort of said &#8220;Our readers are interested in crypto; if you think there&#8217;s a puzzle here!&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I did a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fopinion\u002Farticles\u002F2021-08-08\u002Fkominers-s-conundrums-how-much-is-that-avatar-in-the-window\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esecond one\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that was built around the PFPs: The imagined setup was you had all of these new NFTs had been released &#8212; that we, Bloomberg Conundrums (the puzzle group) &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; had been collecting them surreptitiously for months &#8212; and now we&#8217;d hidden them but you needed to figure out again something about decoding and understanding the addresses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I mentioned in that column &#8212; I referenced the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks and SupDucks &#8212; and then the SupDucks community reached out and said, &#8220;Look, I think you would like this; why don&#8217;t you join our discord and check it out?&#8221; SupDucks is a 10000-PFP collection from the mind of FrankyNines, based on an earlier NFT he&#8217;d created called “Sup Duck” and a related one called “King Frog” &#8212; I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s a series of ducks… &#8212; it&#8217;s a great group of people who boost and cheer each other up by saying &#8220;’sup&#8221; a lot… And then there&#8217;s, you know-\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &lt;laughs&gt; &#8216;sup, Scott?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly. &#8216;sup?!

(A lot of other NFT projects have emerged out of this initial community.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… that was my first entry into an NFT community: I&#8217;d written this puzzle about NFTs, that appealed enough to the NFT community, and that they could sort of tell that I you know, had the personality type that would find this stuff fun.

We&#8217;ve built it with projects, community engagement activities; sometimes collaborative puzzles, sometimes competitive ones… There&#8217;s some Bored Ape community-run hunt going on right now… There&#8217;s sort of a lot of puzzling in the NFT communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have an \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fsignals.mysteryleague.com\u002Fpilcrow-bar\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Earticle\u003C\u002Fa\u003E about the Pilcrow Bar puzzle hunt, and, it was a six-week-long puzzle hunt that a collaborator Sandy Weisz, and I designed for Alinea (this Michelin-star restaurant in Chicago, early pandemic, like June 2020). And it started off easy to moderate difficulty and got into like three to four-hour-long puzzle solves by the end.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what was exciting about the project was: It was a group of many thousands of people, solving really deep puzzle-hunt puzzles &#8212; who hadn&#8217;t really heard of or solved puzzle hunts before. So, for me it was really… sort of proof of concept of just how many people there are out there, who would really deeply enjoy this medium of puzzle-solving &#8212; that goes much deeper than the like 30-second puzzles you see on social media, or even like the 2- to 5-minute type puzzles that you see in escape rooms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, is much more uniquely architected than like The New York Times crossword &#8212; to find friends, family, significant others; strangers on the internet even &#8212; to solve these puzzles with, and it formed so many incredible connections, and micro sub-communities and things, of people working on solving these puzzles together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the record: I wanna state that using standard crosswords and sudokus as examples of what we don&#8217;t do, we don&#8217;t mean to be shitting on those puzzles &#8212; I write crosswords also.

So there are puzzle boxes…\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThere are sequential discovery puzzles, where you discover items along the way that serve as tools helping you with later steps.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDisentanglement puzzles; packing puzzles where you&#8217;re fitting pieces together into some form.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen we have sort of types of puzzle \u003Cem\u003Epresentations\u003C\u002Fem\u003E:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPuzzle hunts, which are sort of puzzle games where each puzzle solves to a word or phrase as an answer.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAnd then there are metapuzzles that use the answers to each of those feeder puzzles, altogether.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThen there are sort of sandboxed, immersive puzzle experiences &#8212; which is a fancy way of saying escape rooms, typically.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, escape rooms: I describe escape rooms as typically in-person &#8212; there&#8217;s been quite the renaissance of virtual escape room options also &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; &#8212; but, escape rooms are essentially a form of immersive in-person gaming. Where typically you&#8217;re in a self-contained environment versus treasure hunting, ARGs etc., are more broadly just site-specific gaming out in the real world (instead of contained in a controlled space). But, escape rooms are so much more than escaping or even just about rooms these days: They&#8217;re really incredible types of immersive gaming experiences that are typically puzzle-driven.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Sorry what does A-R-G stand for again?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Alternate reality game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh okay; keep going, yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Then we also have types of pervasive puzzle experiences &#8212; pulling from the great book “Pervasive Games” which uses that term to describe games that exist out in the real world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, this takes a few different forms most notably, alternate reality games: Which are sort of narrative-driven (often times also puzzle-driven games), juxtaposed on the real world &#8212; where anything and everything in the world can be part of a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere also are more contained, but also site-specific, types of puzzling: this includes treasure hunts, letterboxing, geocaching &#8212; various types of engagement with in-person sites, where you’re solving puzzles out in the real world &#8212; urban treasure hunts as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDid I miss anything Scott?

Now that we have a high-level lay of the land of puzzle types, I’d love go even deeper into the puzzle mediums – or, I guess what you just called Matthew the “puzzle presentation” aspect &#8212; especially when it comes to puzzle hunts (which you both won and mentioned a lot!)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Certainly! So, it&#8217;s sort of hard to describe as one thing, but they have a few general properties &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETypically, each puzzle solves to a word or phrase as a final answer. So in contrast to maybe a New York Times crossword, where a correctly filled in grid is the answer to the puzzle; in a puzzle hunt, if you had a crossword, it would go one step further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And that might be reading every square that has a prime number in it or something. &lt;Sonal: Got it&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;d be a clue that led you to realize, the prime numbers mattered or something.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly. Which gets to… In a crossword, you sort of know what you&#8217;re doing when you&#8217;re presented with a puzzle: You know that you have some clues, and you need to answer the clues, and fill them into a grid.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a puzzle hunt, oftentimes the puzzle is figuring out what to do: You&#8217;re presented with some information, some piece of data, some object. And, puzzle-hunt puzzles will oftentimes have (what&#8217;s called) “flavor text” accompanying them, which gives some keywords\u003Csup\u003E18\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E that you need to pay special attention to, keying in on what might be going on in the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut typically it requires: pattern observation, paying attention to small details, noticing what might be amiss, applying common techniques. You have some clues, figure out what the answers might be. Maybe some of the clues are a little bit too ambiguous to figure out the answer at first, but you fill in the ones that you know for sure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then maybe you notice that &#8212; this is just gonna be an example of a very generic, simple puzzle-hunt style puzzle &#8212; maybe you noticed that the left column of the answers, the answers are in alphabetical order; but the right column, the answers seem to be in some particular order. And then you notice that the left column maybe, are anagrams of one of the answers in the right column plus a letter. That type of wordplay is called a “transaddition”. So you match one from the left column, one to the right column; since the left column (the alphabetized ones), already has a strict ordering, you know that probably the ordering of the right column answers matters. And then maybe the extra letters spell out a clue phrase, which then clues some final word is the final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat might be the flow for &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; a really generic style of this puzzle. &lt;Sonal: Got it&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, there are things to figure out along the way; you don&#8217;t necessarily know what the later steps are &#8212; but there are layers that reveal themselves as you progress through the puzzle. And somehow you can get a final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother property\u003Csup\u003E46\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E of puzzle hunts is “metapuzzles”. At the end of the round, you metapuzzle &#8212; which, in some way uses the answers to all the individual puzzles in that round &#8212; which are called the “feeder” puzzle answers. Again this can take so so many different forms; &lt;Sonal: yah!&gt; I&#8217;m not even going to try and get into examples of that now…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are sort of two categories of metapuzzles: “shell” metapuzzles or “shell-less” metapuzzles. Shell metapuzzles means that you&#8217;re presented with some extra information for the metapuzzle. Whereas shell-less means that the metapuzzle is elegantly contained just within the answers themselves. One is not necessarily better than the other, but, it certainly can be a level more elegant if you can make a shell-less metapuzzle &#8212; where there&#8217;s that extra layer of hidden meaning contained within the answers staring you in the face the entire time. That then once you&#8217;ve solved all of these individual puzzles (that individually are cohesive satisfying experiences), you then reveal another entirely new layer of meaning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, the structure can continue on from there; there can be meta metapuzzles that combine all the metapuzzles. Metapuzzle structures can get really creative: So, they can use more than just even the answers to the feeder puzzles. They can also use some version of the mechanics to the feeder puzzles. They can use answers to feeder puzzles from previous rounds, sort of a waterfall\u002F cascade structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favorite MIT Mystery Hunt puzzle rounds &#8212; the world&#8217;s biggest annual puzzle hunt which happens at MIT annually in January; it involves thousands of participants, hundreds of puzzles; it&#8217;s all-out battle-royale of puzzles, with pulling out all the stops in terms of difficulty and depth and such &#8212; one of my all-time favorite metapuzzle structures I&#8217;ve seen was in the 2020 Mystery Hunt designed by Galactic Trendsetters.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The official team name is like &#8220;Whoosh, Galactic Trendsetters, screeeee…&#8221; right, there you go. &lt;Matthew: Yes, that one&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Nice sound effects, Scott! &lt;Scott: thank you&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The sound effects are part of their name &lt;Sonal: I love it (laughs)&gt;; I mispronounced it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut they had this one round, the nano round &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if you remember this Scott~\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E ~Oh god yah that was epic~\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E ~Yah; Where normally, you have a bunch of feeder puzzles, and then there&#8217;s a metapuzzle at the end. In this round, you were presented with the answer to the metapuzzle at the start &#8212; and then a bunch of feeder puzzles &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EExcept one of the constituent feeder puzzles wasn&#8217;t solvable, on its own, and you had to realize that it was a reverse metapuzzle structure: So you actually had to backsolve that feeder puzzle answer, from knowing the meta answer to the round and solving all the other puzzles to that round. “Backsolve” basically means once you know the answer to a metapuzzle, by the constraints of the meta, and by maybe some of the constraints of an individual puzzle, you can actually figure out the answer to a feeder puzzle without actually forward-solving it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ah, fascinating.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, that&#8217;s backsolving, and then constrasting &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; “partial-solving” means solving a puzzle without fully solving it. So say there&#8217;s a puzzle that has 30 lines of data, and I&#8217;m getting a letter from each line; if I have two-thirds of those letters, I can probably figure out what the words it’s spelling out are. And without fully solving the puzzle, I can still figure out what the missing letters are and arrive at the final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut anyhow: You backsolve this one answer, and then solving that puzzle unlocked a sub-round for which that puzzle was the meta. And then it recursively continued forward for I think three layers or so? I&#8217;m getting pretty deep pretty quickly in this sort of&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Keep going, we like the deep; go ahead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah. But I think a bigger theme that I&#8217;m getting at here is &#8212; puzzle design has to be for a specific audience. A puzzle is not a good puzzle generally, it&#8217;s a good puzzle relative to who it&#8217;s designed to be solved by.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if I&#8217;m designing a puzzle for team-building activity for a tech company, for a bunch of software engineers, I know I can rely on a certain type of analytical thinking and communication skills, but not on knowledge of puzzle conventions. &lt;Sonal: Right&gt; But I will know that software engineers intuitively will know what puzzle indexing is, because indexing is a key concept in programming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVersus if I&#8217;m designing a puzzle hunt for an audience of puzzle hunters, &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; I can&#8217;t just design generic\u003Csup\u003E97\u003C\u002Fsup\u003Epuzzles and expect them to be interesting and thought-provoking &#8212; because those people will know all the conventions; they&#8217;ll know what to expect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, when I&#8217;m designing for that sort of audience, I&#8217;m intending to subvert their expectations relative to how they would expect the puzzles to unfold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, if I&#8217;m designing a music puzzle for an audience of musicians, I can design a-ha moments, I can design shifts in perception around getting those musicians to maybe see conventions of musical notation, or manipulate audio files in a way that is novel to them. Versus if I&#8217;m designing a music puzzle for an audience of non-musicians, I may pick something that&#8217;s a special property of music that myself as a musician, something that I want to share with those people… Some a-ha I&#8217;ve had about music; and I&#8217;ll use the structure of the puzzle to get the solvers to experience that moment on their own.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Teach!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPuzzles have this really special property &#8212; in contrast to other types of game and interaction design &#8212; where you&#8217;re not telling people what to do; you&#8217;re providing them with some materials, some experiential framing that leads them to figure out what to do on their own. And, when done properly, it sets them up for these really powerful moments of revelation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So to pick on this education note for a moment &#8212; Scott just said, it’s like teaching &#8212; and I came from the world of developmental psychology (that was my grad work); and one of the things that was very much in vogue was you know this idea of constructivism and how students learn. It was an NSF grant, National Science Foundation grant that I was on about early numeracy in preschoolers; and it was how you harness children&#8217;s natural numeracy and skills, before they even have any formal systems for learning math.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, what was super fascinating about it is the philosophy of this Russian cognitive psychologist &#8212; Vygotsky, who wrote a book called \u003Cem\u003EMind in Society\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; and one of the key concepts that comes up is this idea of “scaffolding”… as a way to set up the learning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the ideal teacher essentially &#8212; in this context (and this applies in Montessori, Reggio Emilia, lots of school practices) &#8212; they essentially set up a scaffolding in the environment, that this child or student or person then explores, to construct their own learning. And that&#8217;s literally just kinda like what you just said and how &lt;Scott: One hundred percent&gt; it maps to puzzle design. And it&#8217;s like what you said Scott about education, it&#8217;s like teaching.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s exactly it; and we should both talk about the sort of philosophies of puzzle design. But for me, this scaffolding component is absolutely central &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want people to be able to make discoveries right; you want a discovery to feel like an accomplishment and a major a-ha… But you also want to sort of enable them to make constant forward progress in some sense, right. Like it&#8217;s okay to get stuck sometimes or it&#8217;s okay to you know be thinking like where is this puzzle taking me &#8212; but it shouldn&#8217;t be a way\u002F in the sense that you&#8217;re stuck in that like you wanna quit.

Puzzle hunts and alternate reality games are especially intriguing because they are fertile ground for really densely layered puzzle architectures &#8212; contrasting with other types of puzzles where, you sort of know what you&#8217;re supposed to do; it&#8217;s more figuring out how to do it, than figuring out what to do, &lt;Sonal: mmm… mhm&gt; and then sort of peeling back layer upon layer.

And at that point it&#8217;s less about what you do with the data &#8212; it&#8217;s less about this specific abstraction being the puzzle &#8212; as the context in which it&#8217;s (ideally novelly) presented, being a matter of recognizing the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is the case with any sorts of ciphers: It&#8217;s deciphering something, solving a Vigenère cipher, or a pigpen cipher &#8212; it&#8217;s not about decoding that is a puzzle, it&#8217;s about recognizing the cipher; it&#8217;s about the type of environmental pattern recognition, that is the actual act of puzzling.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yup.

Solving a puzzle is about crossing a threshold of perception &#8212; It&#8217;s about seeing something one way, and then through a process of frustration, and observation, and playing around, and looking for patterns, and making discoveries… you&#8217;re led to see it a different way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you can be given that final answer; that doesn&#8217;t mean you have solved the puzzle. In the context of a competition, when something is framed as a competitive puzzle hunt and you need to call on this final answer &#8212; sure, it&#8217;s marked as solved; but solving the puzzle for me really is about experiencing that shift in perception.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah.

That it needs to be a proportionately satisfying payoff for the solver, to make them want to go through this process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you really put in the legwork, feeling like you&#8217;re making progress &#8212; not just grinding and not getting anywhere &#8212; but when you finally overcome the final hurdle, it&#8217;s all the more satisfying because of the work that you&#8217;ve put in. When that work is designed in such a way so that it does feel like it&#8217;s leading into the final answer, instead of just sort of fizzling off at the end. When done well can be this really climactic moment of revelation. &lt;Sonal: Yeah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis gets into another point, which is: A puzzle needs to be designed such that what it gates&#8211; So, gating in puzzle design or escape room design, game design generally &#8212; means, there&#8217;s something preventing you from accessing further content: So in the case of an escape room, it might be a padlock that you have to put a number into that opens a chest that has a new item you need. Or in the case of a puzzle hunt, it might be typing in your answer to a puzzle, which in turn unlocks a new round of puzzles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gating needs to be conceived such that it&#8217;s worth fully solving the puzzle, it&#8217;s worth &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; getting a satisfying experience instead of being inclined to sidestep that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, to give a simple example from a sort of escape room-type mindset: If you have a padlock on a chest, the a-ha of the puzzle aligns with the satisfaction of the lock popping open, and then you move on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, say you had four separate puzzles that each gave you one digit &#8212; in addition to it not being very satisfying to just get a digit from zero through nine from a puzzle &#8212; It also means that when you get down to that last puzzle, it&#8217;s not a matter of if I fully solve this one puzzle that has a cohesive mechanic, but rather, do I go through the process of solving this last puzzle? Or do I do what&#8217;s probably less effort of just spinning the last dial?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you&#8217;re sort of gating yourself instead of the game gating you. So, the stakes for the a-ha feel less real because you&#8217;re sort of breaking the immersion. It really has to be worth it for you to solve that last puzzle &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; if that requires more effort than the other path of just brute-forcing it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis applies to competitive framing as well: Does it make sense to fully solve the puzzle; are you borrowing the answer from a different team who you happen to hear the answer from. What types of behavior are you incentivizing? And, is the path of least resistance &#8212; is that the experience you want solvers to take? What types of behavior at each possible point throughout the experience, are you setting them up for?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So talking about incentive design and behavioral design &lt;Matthew: yah&gt;, and this, obviously maps onto crypto &#8212; given what we&#8217;ve talked about so far, taxonomy of puzzles, some of the mechanics, some of the design, some of the software analogies &#8212; how would you think about this in the context of crypto?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well first of all, it&#8217;s very similar to the intellectual challenge of designing an incentive scheme. Like how is your token going to work; what is it going to do or enable your community to do? What will happen as people start to engage with it; how will the experience evolve? Like these are all the same types of questions that you sort of formulate when you&#8217;re constructing a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike I often think of a token system as being sort of a big community puzzle environment, that&#8217;s set up by the project creators, and enabling it to evolve and build upon itself in exactly the way that like a collaborative puzzle-solving exercise works. And that means that as the designer that you have to think about all of these things that Matthew was just talking about in terms of puzzle design: You want it to drive incentives that make people excited about engaging and exploring the boundaries of what your design can do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also wanna make the thing feel intuitive &#8212; even if it&#8217;s new; right something can be novel and yet sort of be intuitive at every step of engagement &#8212; And if you&#8217;re a crypto project that&#8217;s trying to reach broad consumers, you&#8217;re facing very much the same design challenge that Matthew and I face when we write puzzles for general audiences. It turns out: you can get people in very very general audiences to solve incredibly difficult puzzles… even thinking going in that they&#8217;re not gonna be able to, if you design the architecture of the puzzle in a way that sort of leads them along, and then the unlocks start to appear, and then they gain confidence and understanding of the structure of the puzzle as they go, and it can get harder. Similarly, that&#8217;s very much how a crypto project &#8212; especially one that&#8217;s trying to reach an audience that&#8217;s not already deep in the weeds of crypto, but rather that is going to engage with it and sort of use it as an exploration and a path in…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then similarly, this point about audiences, right &#8212; the idea that the same thing will be interpreted very differently by two audiences with different experiences and different backgrounds &#8212; this crops up in crypto design all the time, too. Even just the interfaces through which we interact with crypto, right: Are you using a custodial wallet or a non-custodial wallet; are you minting on a website, or are you minting through the contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, you see you see NFT launches that are only minted through contract. And why is that? The aesthetic of what the project is trying to accomplish, they essentially want to limit to people who have the technical sophistication to access it in this way: It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re trying to be a closed community for the sake of just being insular, rather, the technical complexity of joining is helping screen for the audience that they think will actually appreciate what they&#8217;re doing. &lt;Sonal: Yeah…&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo in a puzzle hunt, often the first puzzles or the first round of puzzles are much more accessible than the others. And then if you find that the environment and the ecosystem being set up by the project is one that feels right, then you might start working really hard and be willing to like put much more effort in. And all of that pulls back to a design problem on behalf of the creator &#8212; right, if you&#8217;re creating this project, you want to enable people to dip their toe in and then discover &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; they want to swim and then you know also immerse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, that intro round really is a welcome &#8212; but it&#8217;s also about building trust in the integrity of the design. It&#8217;s also an opportunity to level the playing field just a little bit. &lt;Scott: yes&gt; So, when people are newer to puzzles, they may not be as familiar with the conventions &#8212; or even just the conventions of a particular designer or design team &#8212; and those newer puzzles are opportunities to present the atomic elements of whatever puzzle world people are being presented with. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, like in a video game where you&#8217;re maybe taught some basic mechanics, and then you&#8217;re throwing variation after variation and hybrids of those variations &#8212; similarly with puzzle mechanics, you&#8217;re introducing people to the general style and aesthetics and what they can do, what they can&#8217;t do: Are the puzzles going totally outside of the box, and expecting you to dive into the source code, and use real-world components? Are they all just contained within PDF?

They wanna get the intentionality (to Matthew&#8217;s point), that they are in a trusted place, where someone has intentionally put things together for them; &lt;yah&gt; so I think that&#8217;s a really great analogy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne quick thing: The two of you are kinda dancing in a really interesting tension between both the idea of insider access, and the idea of accessibility &lt;Scott: yes&gt; It&#8217;s almost like a bit of a paradox &#8212; Okay there&#8217;s a little signaling to your like-minded, quote-&#8220;community&#8221;, whatever it is, it could be cut across whatever level &#8212; a certain domain knowledge, a certain specialty, a certain interest; it could just be puzzles in the meta. Or, there&#8217;s also the sense of, well, how do we also make it not too insular and inaccessible to people joining? &lt;Scott: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause honestly when I hear you guys talk, it feels extremely intricate\u003Csup\u003E73\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E and internal &#8212; and frankly just to draw the analogy to crypto &#8212; that also comes up quite a bit with people feeling like they&#8217;re entering into a crypto community. So I&#8217;d love you to kinda break down how this works in the puzzle world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally; this is such a great question.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So I think this touches on a few things. One is, how to approach difficulty in puzzle design. Because difficult puzzles can be fun, but it&#8217;s a lot harder to design an easy novel elegant puzzle than it is to design a difficult puzzle. And of course it&#8217;s challenging to design a difficult puzzle that is also elegant and satisfying… But the easiest type of puzzle to design is a very very difficult puzzle that absolutely nobody can solve and nobody would have fun solving. And, we see plenty of people doing this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, one of the safeguards against this is of course, “playtesting” &#8212; where when you come up with a puzzle idea, implement it, you don&#8217;t just release it to your solvers; you show it to some playtesters first who are a curated community of people. When I&#8217;m designing a project, depending on the audience and timeline and budget, I&#8217;ll have anywhere from one or two playtesters to dozens across multiple rounds &#8212; from people playtesting sort of a stub of the initial idea, to a fully implemented draft, to final proofing the sort of post-prod, fully artified version of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I&#8217;m designing a puzzle hunt for a crypto community for instance, it&#8217;s likely that those people aren&#8217;t going to be familiar with puzzle hunts already. They aren&#8217;t going to know all of these conventions and all of the sort of in-the-weeds nuances that Scott and I are discussing here. And, to some extent they don&#8217;t have to, but to some extent we also need to meet them halfway: We need to recognize what their behaviors are going to be, what their initial perceptions are going to be, how to properly engage them and really get them excited about exploring this world in the way that we hope for them to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it&#8217;s important to playtest with a representative sampling of the type of community who is actually going to be playing the game. So, I have (for my own puzzle work) a private Discord server where I have a bunch of puzzle people who regularly playtest my puzzles, give me their feedback, make sure the actual puzzle mechanics work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then when I&#8217;m figuring out the exact framing of the puzzle, how it&#8217;s going to be presented, the flavor text, the hints that accompany the puzzle, I&#8217;m not playtesting with those people still &#8212; I&#8217;m finding some people who are of a similar demographic, similar background to the actual people who are going to be solving my hunt. And, that allows me to sort of gauge the way the puzzles are going to be received, before they&#8217;re actually out in the field. And if things go terribly wrong then, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the hunt is going to be wrong, it is going to be totally broken; &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; I can adjust accordingly in advance. &lt;Sonal: that’s great&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is similar to software development cycles as well: &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; We would never release a piece of software without unit-testing everything, and integration testing everything, and making sure that it fully works at all stages. We would never commit one final code change and be like oh it worked in the last stage &lt;Sonal: yah… totally&gt; so it probably still works; we would run all of our tests again before releasing it. And the same applies to experience design and its many forms, and especially to puzzle design, where, we are actively encouraging solvers to pay attention to every last detail to get in the mindset that anything could be part of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… in an elegant puzzle-hunt style puzzle, everything sort of is part of the puzzle. We&#8217;re not adding in random text that seems puzzle-y but actually means nothing. There&#8217;s a lot of attention paid to making sure that any actual noise in the puzzle couldn&#8217;t be interpreted as meaningful noise. &lt;Sonal: right!&gt; So that means if we expect the solvers to put a list of data in a new ordering based on some property of the data, we intentionally put the data initially in some ordering that&#8217;s clearly not the final ordering. So like I was saying previously, that can be alphabetical ordering, that can be a bullet-point list rather than a numbered list; various things to signal the type of behavior we expect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what this all translates to in terms of access to the community, is: Not that we should design easier puzzles, but rather that we should give accessible points to people and welcome them into this community. Where, by the final puzzle, the solvers are solving things that they didn&#8217;t realize they were able to &#8212; they&#8217;re presented with something that would&#8217;ve seemed utterly impenetrable at the beginning… but by the end through the way in which the game has guided them to build up their abilities they realize that yes, they&#8217;re able to do this as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this actually gets at one of the biggest differences between newer puzzlers, and people who are familiar with these styles of puzzles (or any styles of puzzles really) &#8212; which is: Simply just the willingness to try things. Oftentimes when I&#8217;m running puzzles of any level of difficulty for people who are new to puzzles, they&#8217;ll prematurely come to me or whoever is running the game, for hints. And of course, prior to telling them what to do, we&#8217;ll say, &#8220;What have you tried so far?&#8221; And oftentimes they&#8217;ll make a correct observation; they&#8217;ll describe part of the solution, and then I&#8217;ll reply &#8220;Well, did you try that?&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so many times I hear the response, &#8220;No, because I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would be correct.&#8221; And it&#8217;s that willingness to just try that really differentiates those more novice solvers from more experienced solvers who are willing to go down a rabbit hole, see if it works… and then embrace the fact that even when it doesn&#8217;t work, they perhaps learn something interesting along the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s so fascinating ‘cause earlier when you talked about the &#8220;payoff&#8221; &#8212; that was like a word that I use in editorial all the time &#8212; because a lot of people have these religious debates about how long a piece should be… &lt;Matthew: mhm&gt; and I always say length is arbitrary to me, quite frankly; it&#8217;s really about the “payoff proportional” to what you&#8217;re putting in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, editorially, when you just described that like the designer has to put in these sort of intermediate things, and things to kinda bring people along – and-and you again, reinforced this idea of trust &#8212; it made me think of a very editorial concept that I use all the time when it comes to religious debates between quote-&#8220;dumbing things down&#8221; or not (‘cause a lot of people say, oh technical content, oh we have to simplify it) and I&#8217;m just like, it&#8217;s not like an either\u002For, you can actually have both: as long as you have good “signposting” to bring people along.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, this insider\u002Foutsider piece is very salient… coming back to how you think about this from the perspective of crypto, a lot of crypto communities are mostly &#8212; by nature at the moment, right, mostly made up of people who are insiders because they&#8217;ve overcome tremendous technical hurdles to gain access in the first place &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a custodial crypto wallet and you&#8217;re just collecting you know NBA Top Shot NFTs or something like that, you learned a bunch of stuff: You&#8217;ve signed up for a piece of software; you&#8217;ve overcome a bunch of different steps to get in; and you already have some intuition for the lingo, for the lay of the land, for the types of things you might be doing. And for what the crypto actually is: Like what are these digital assets that you&#8217;re trading, or like what are these protocols you&#8217;re interfacing with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one thing is the people who have all done that have a shared text, right &#8212; it&#8217;s very much like puzzlers right, you have this set of shared knowledge and understanding of some basic conventions and features of what a thing might be &#8212; But by the same token, what&#8217;s often most intriguing or exciting are using and remixing all of those ideas in new and powerful ways; right, new, powerful, and hopefully elegant ways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd meanwhile, if you&#8217;re someone who is outside &#8212; right as you were both just saying, like the signposting, and the simple access points to start to understand what&#8217;s going on, are really really important &#8212; and the more complex the eventual exercise is, the more individual signposting steps you need, the more sort of components;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI really connected to Matthew&#8217;s description that first-time puzzlers often have really good instincts, but are afraid to try… And like crypto, because you know still so much of it is so hard to navigate, you could accidentally pay a massive gas fee while trying to do a transaction that doesn&#8217;t even succeed; like there&#8217;s lots of stuff that can go wrong: There&#8217;s the same sort of trepidation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it&#8217;s really important if you&#8217;re building &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re building something that is unusual, and novel, and exciting in all the ways that a new type of puzzle might be &#8212; it&#8217;s all the more incumbent on the builder to provide those sorts of signposting and create the trust and understanding with your user that enables them to enter, and explore, and gain confidence to explore\u003Csup\u003E25\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that&#8217;s an incentive design challenge, right; and that&#8217;s exactly what you have to do when you&#8217;re launching a crypto project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Absolutely. One of the most important principles is that puzzles are experiences, and we need to design them as experiences, not things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo looking at other experiences, a restaurant for instance: When you go to a nice restaurant, your experience starts not when you get served your plate of food &#8212; but from the moment you go to that restaurant&#8217;s website, and make a reservation; and look at the menu; figure out how to get in the door, get seated, order, your conversation with the waiter, how you pay for the food; the entire thing is part of your dining experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, a puzzle experience starts the first touch point of however you&#8217;re engaging with the puzzle &#8212; whether that&#8217;s signing up for a puzzle hunt, or getting an email about a promotional game that an NFT community is putting on. All of this affects your mindset, your motivations going into the game, and really affects how you solve the puzzle, how you experience the puzzles themselves. Those things in my opinion really are inseparable. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, you can design the most amazing crossword puzzle, and if the website that checks your answers breaks while solving it, that&#8217;s a bad puzzle experience. If, halfway through the puzzle you notice a typo in it, and you don’t get a response from the people running the puzzle hunt for three hours; that&#8217;s part of the puzzle experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can&#8217;t really distinguish between the quality of what the puzzle could have been (if it ran perfectly), and the experience you actually had with it. Your feeling of when you solve the puzzle, are you reveling in the victory, or are you worried that you didn&#8217;t win the prize so did it matter??\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This is exactly the experience of being part of an NFT community. If the community does things that don&#8217;t match your expectations in one way or another, they set up a story, and then there&#8217;s like a second like spinoff project, and there&#8217;s no sort of aesthetic sensibility…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne that did it really incredibly recently is Chain Runners &#8212; and I&#8217;m a holder, I&#8217;m a very involved member of the community (so like all biases to be clear, and this is not financial advice, of course) &#8212; but they did something really cool that I liked: So their genesis collection was these sort of pixelated, two-dimensional, characters; you know very sci-fi, cyberpunk characters. And they just launched a three-dimensional, metaverse-ready instantiation of these same types of characters (the Chain Runners). And for the experience of minting the Chain Runners XR (this follow-up collection), normally, when you mint an NFT, you just go to a website or you go to the contract, potentially, and you press some buttons, and then the NFT gets added to your wallet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere… a big part of the story was this emergence from 2-D to 3-D. And, the minting website literally took you into a 3-D world: So, you walked to the computer where you access the mint process. And then once you did the mint, it took you through a tunnel, and like now you&#8217;re in a 3-D mini escape room that you could explore (shoutouts to Nav who did most of the development; and I guess footnote disclosure: I had a little bit of influence on the puzzle design for the escape room).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, then when you solved the escape room, it gave you a code that you could bring back to the Discord server, and it would give you access to a special channel just for the people who ‘d sort of played the full mint experience through solving all the puzzles. It was totally immersive &#8212; you were immersed in almost a video game experience &#8212; but then, it turned out that the game was self-aware: It knew the experience of being a Chain Runner is not just your metaverse immersion, but also the experience with the community in the Discord, and pulls back to something that you take out of this three-dimensional world… that shows the game world and the real world are one and the same, that sort of there&#8217;s a semi-permeable membrane between the two somehow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This actually makes me think, how much puzzles apply so much to token-gated communities, and any other token-gated events; like there’s so many ways to bridge the physical and digital &lt;Scott: exactly&gt; there, as well as in going through tiering to show \u003Cem\u003Ecommitment\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. &lt;Scott: yup&gt; Because the whole point again, is skin in the game and proportional &#8212; not to necessarily financial investment of things &#8212; but actually your contributions, your work, your time, your interest; like that&#8217;s how you know people wanna be in the community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right! I mean people spent literally hours solving this escape-room game in order to gain access to this secret Discord channel. And it was incredible to think of this, realization, right: In the mint experience, people usually pop in and pop out; you&#8217;re talking a minute, you know if you sped up the gas enough, it might be seconds. Whereas here, it became this transformation of the two-dimensional to the three-dimensional world that then gives you something for the outside world as well. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd all of this fits very coherently and intuitively in the mythos of the world the Chain Runners are setting up. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; If instead, the secondary collection had been, I don&#8217;t know, renaissance fair characters or weird like cartoon animals &#8212; like nothing wrong with renaissance character NFTs, nothing wrong with cartoon animal NFTs &#8212; but they would be jarring in the experience of this cyberpunk world. Whereas in the cyberpunk world, the Discord is part of the cyberpunk world too, right; it all sort of comes together and forms a really coherent single piece.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Fantastic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so a question I&#8217;ve been dying to ask you guys throughout this episode, which is who designs the puzzle, like who is the designer. And is the puzzle architect &#8212; like you know, what&#8217;s his name from Hunger Games; I was thinking of (ohmygosh, I forgot his name, the Philip Hoffman character in the movie version but, he had some kinda Greek name) &#8212; but anyway:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn crypto, we have this unique challenge-slash \u002F opportunity of it being decentralized &#8212; even though there are people who have more stakes or are the original creators or have unique IP rights or various things &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Ewho is the creator? \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMatthew made the analogy that this is like software design, and both of you guys have said this; and to me, it strikes me as a very opinionated form of software design. Even if you have it revealing itself in gates, and various forms, it still is sort of almost pre-decided, &lt;Scott: mm&gt; and it made me think again of this notion of like smart contracts, and even formal verification: Like you put the thing out the world, you don&#8217;t get to necessarily edit it after the fact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, I wondered how does and does that not play out as analogies with puzzles and crypto; and, are there cases of successful puzzles where they are actually modified once they&#8217;ve been created, in real-time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh gosh… that is such a great analogy I&#8217;ve never thought of before &#8212; yeah, a puzzle is basically a smart contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat you design and experience, that should proceed in certain ways, and like has boundary conditions and things can happen outside the boundaries, but basically you&#8217;re helping people follow a path where all the components of the path are locked in up front. &lt;Sonal: Encoded!&gt; If you get something wrong &#8212; if you like leave a red herring that&#8217;s really confusing, that people might get lost and sort of fall off the path, and you usually don&#8217;t want to be in the position of retconning (of having to go back and remove a red herring or fix something) &#8212; ideally, it all gets locked in up front, it&#8217;s a smart contract, and then people explore all of the affordances and possibilities of the contract as they go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This leads into another distinction I like to make in puzzle design which is that between “clueing” and “hinting” &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, clues represent the integral, baked-in information needed to solve the puzzle. So a clue is something that is included with the puzzle, that you couldn&#8217;t take it away and be left with a complete puzzle. (Maybe you could still solve it by an arbitrary leap of logic, but the clue structure is really what allows the puzzle to make sense, that allows everything to lock in and be elegantly cohesive.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHinting, in contrast, is what allows you to dynamically adapt to a variety of solving behavior. It acknowledges that different people may get stuck in a certain way of thinking, or not be familiar with something: the puzzle is referring to a specific video game that isn&#8217;t as easily googleable as the designer thought, and the hint allows people who aren&#8217;t familiar with that video game reference to make that connection too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut: When we design a puzzle, we need to take into account both the static and dynamic guardrails for the experience, signposting for the experience &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; &#8212; both how we guide people to solve puzzle on the core path; and how we keep them along the intended experience, if they&#8217;re passing that “threshold of frustration”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E We&#8217;re not here to design puzzles that no one&#8217;s ever gonna be able to solve, right. Some people think the goal is actually to design puzzles that are hard &#8212; and that&#8217;s totally not the goal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This actually relates back to another extension of what I was saying previously about difficulty, which is &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I design a puzzle for different types of audiences, whether it&#8217;s designing a custom puzzle for a specific individual, for a proposal; versus for teams of 3 to 5 people with 200 teams solving at once; versus a 2000-person community solving an ARG and all uniting together to tackle puzzles (And oftentimes it&#8217;s harder to test that experience because I don&#8217;t have a group of 2000 people working together testing a puzzle).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, I approach difficulty very differently, and I approach how precisely I&#8217;m going to clue something differently. I don&#8217;t want the puzzle to be solved within minutes of its release. And at the same time, I don&#8217;t want the a-has to be completely arcane, and random, and unsatisfying. They still need to adhere to the principles of good puzzle design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know it&#8217;s interesting because &#8212; I know you joked earlier Matthew that you don&#8217;t really know games; and I did actually, growing up; I grew up on Atari games as a young child &lt;Matthew: Nice&gt; &#8212; but, one thing keeps coming up, this idea of difficulty\u002F tiering &#8212; I do wanna reference a popular law that came out of the Atari world and Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari, which was:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat games should be “easy to learn but difficult to master”. I&#8217;m just curious if you guys have any thoughts, just this general principle of “Nolan&#8217;s law”, and how that does and doesn&#8217;t apply in this context of puzzles and\u002For crypto design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah I think mastery is an interesting concept when it comes to puzzle hunts. Because, there oftentimes isn&#8217;t the same type of linear, incremental mastery that you see in videogame &lt;Sonal: a game, yah&gt; puzzles, for instance &#8212; once you cross the threshold of a specific puzzle (of knowing how it works), you know how it works; there&#8217;s no going back.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that certainly may influence your knowledge of when approaching any future puzzles of being able to recognize, “Oh I&#8217;ve seen this mechanic before”. But it&#8217;s not necessarily about iterating through a level and finding the best way to solve it, per se.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut: There&#8217;s sort of a “meta mastery” where you&#8217;re building up your skills &#8212; and “skills” not just in terms of recognizing mechanics, and having better-honed logical abilities &#8212; it&#8217;s also knowing your own behavior, the sort of psychological mastery of how you approach solving puzzles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… this actually gets to one of the properties of really broadly impactful puzzle design &#8212; that I somewhat rarely see but often happens accidentally &#8212; which is: Some of the best puzzles stay with you outside of the experience of solving the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd: It can also apply to yourself; it can apply to even just identifying the puzzles in the world around you. And, this actually relates back to what we were saying earlier about the difference between behavior of newer puzzle solvers versus more experienced solvers…  So, puzzles are about creating meaning from noise, from chaos. And through this, we really are telling a narrative; we are telling a cohesive story.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well I don&#8217;t know if it applies, but Loot and the derivatives that the community co-created &#8212; that&#8217;s a case where, there is like this sense of unfolding, but what&#8217;s really fascinating is undoing a lot of classic narrative construction. Because it is being created by the community, &lt;mhm&gt; and then they&#8217;re putting a lore around it. I think it&#8217;s something we see a lot more in crypto because of the decentralized nature of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s really interesting; you know there are memes that take on form in crypto, and the exact same thing happens in the puzzle community &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike, there&#8217;s a puzzle type that was invented where somebody came up with this puzzle format; and the original one I think was just called Duck Konundrum &#8212; That&#8217;s right, Matthew, right? Like, it was just called Duck Konundrum?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah by Dan Katz I believe, in a Mystery Hunt many years ago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. So they introduced this puzzle called &#8220;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fpuzzles.mit.edu\u002F2000\u002Fset5\u002F6\u002FPuzzle.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDuck Konundrum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&#8220;, in which you get rules out of order, and you have to put them in order and then sort of step through all of them &#8212; It&#8217;s like getting a computer program in shards, and having to figure out you know the unique way in which the shards make coherent sense. And what&#8217;s fun about it is: lots of different sequences almost make sense. And then you get to the last one you&#8217;re like, Oh wait no I can&#8217;t- I now can&#8217;t use the last shard &#8212; like the n-minus-one shard has got me to a position that the last shard can&#8217;t act upon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so you’re constantly trying to reorganize this thing in sort of like a meta-logic puzzle somehow. And this was so popular, that people started riffing off of this format, and now it&#8217;s called a “Duck Konundrum” &#8212; like you&#8217;ll open up a puzzle and be like ohmygosh, it&#8217;s another Duck Konundrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s kinda what happened, I think, with releasing bits of Loot. &lt;Scott: Totally!&gt; The community was like they&#8217;d come in at midnight and be like, &#8220;What does this mean,&#8221; and kinda try to figure it out together, you know.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And then these things sort of establish memes, within communities that then start crossing over across communities… And so you can introduce like a new central meme. Like some of Dom&#8217;s work, created a new way of designing an NFT project, that others then started building on, and reformatting, and remixing in different ways. That&#8217;s exactly what happens with puzzles as well. And Duck Konundrums are a perfect example of this…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou now even see ones where there are metareferences made to the duck &#8212; but you know it&#8217;s about alligators or something &#8212; but somehow there&#8217;s a duck that appears midway through the story, and you&#8217;re like wait oh I get it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. Puzzle hunts are deeply a community that constantly is riffing on their discoveries, and the way that they&#8217;re subverting expectations\u003Csup\u003E35\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E of solvers is by referencing previous things and then doing something slightly different.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd like we were saying before about how to welcome people to this community, it&#8217;s by being self-aware of how it&#8217;s so self-referential, and inviting people into the community &#8212; without expectations of needing to go so deeply &lt;Sonal: yes!&gt; but rather distilling the key experiential architecture, for people who people who don&#8217;t know or need all the context.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes exactly; it&#8217;s inclusion, not exclusion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, that’s a great note to end on; thank you both so much for joining this special bonus holiday-ish episode of “web3 with a16z”; we’ll resume our regular programming with the next episode.
