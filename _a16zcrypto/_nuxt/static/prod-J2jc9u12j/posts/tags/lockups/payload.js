The build-out can range anywhere from three-to-five months for more standard tokens, like Ethereum ERC-20s or Solana SPLs, to nine months for new blockchains, or even longer for tokens involving SNARKs, privacy features, or interactions with layer 2 (L2) networks.

The SEC argues that nearly every token should be registered under U.S. securities laws. Builders argue that this is nonsensical.

Why does the market keep repeating these cycles &#8212; instead of supporting the more productive blockchain-based innovations that will truly make a difference?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMemecoins are crypto tokens used mostly for humor, born of joining an online community that’s in on the joke. You’ve likely heard of Dogecoin, based on the old \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fknowyourmeme.com\u002Fmemes\u002Fdoge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edoge\u003C\u002Fa\u003E meme featuring images of Shiba Inu dogs.

This kind of “memecoin” embodies various facets of internet culture and is mostly harmless, while other memecoins \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2024-03-13\u002Fmemecoin-trading-volume-rises-to-levels-last-seen-before-crypto-bubble-burst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eare not\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut my goal here isn’t to defend or to diminish memecoins. It’s to point out the backwardness of a policy regime that lets memecoins thrive &#8212; while crypto companies and blockchain tokens with more productive use cases face hurdles. Any mememaker can easily create, launch, and even automatically list tokens, including tokens that derogate specific politicians and celebrities. But entrepreneurs trying to build something real and lasting? They get stuck in regulatory purgatory.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s actually safer to release a memecoin today with \u003Cem\u003Eno \u003C\u002Fem\u003Euse case, than it is to launch a token that’s \u003Cem\u003Euseful\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Think about it this way: We’d consider it a policy failure if we had a securities market that incentivized only GameStop \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftime.com\u002F6312307\u002Fgamestop-meme-stocks-dumb-money\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ememe stocks\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, but that rejected the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA &#8212; all companies with products people use daily. Yet current regulations encourage platforms to list memecoins and not other, more useful tokens. The lack of regulatory clarity in the crypto industry means platforms and entrepreneurs live under constant fear that the more productive blockchain token they are listing or developing could suddenly be deemed a security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI call the distinction between these more speculative and productive use cases in the crypto industry the “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fblockchain-culture-computer-vs-casino\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecomputer vs. the casino\u003C\u002Fa\u003E”. One culture (“the casino”) sees blockchains as a way to launch tokens primarily for trading and gambling. The other culture (“the computer”) is more interested in blockchains as a new platform for innovation, much like web, social, and mobile were before it. It is possible that a memecoin community could \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002Fdp2gbWsPFgY?si=wSa8kKQiNmqw-i2r&amp;t=43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eevolve\u003C\u002Fa\u003E its token by adding more utility over time; after all, many disruptive innovations we use today once started out looking like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2010\u002F01\u002F03\u002Fthe-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ea toy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. “Utility” matters because at its core, a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Ftokens-are-a-new-digital-primitive\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etoken is\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a new digital primitive that offer property rights online for anyone.

They could verify proof of authenticity to protect against deepfakes. They could allow more voice in, or the ability to exit, from a particular social network &#8212; especially if you don’t like the moderation policies or who those networks kick off and keep on. They could give users a vote in a platform’s decisions, especially if those users’ livelihoods are dependent on that platform. They could mark “proof of humanity” against artificial intelligence. Or they could just generally serve as a decentralizing counterbalance to the centralizing power of enterprises.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOur legal frameworks should be encouraging these kinds of innovations. So why are we prioritizing memes over matter? U.S. securities laws don’t empower the SEC to make merit-based judgments about an investment. Nor is it the SEC’s job to end speculation altogether. Instead, the agency’s role is to (1) protect investors; (2) maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and (3) facilitate capital formation. The SEC is failing across all three of these objectives when it comes to digital asset markets and tokens.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe primary test the SEC uses to determine whether or not something is a security is the 1946 \u003Cem\u003EHowey \u003C\u002Fem\u003Etest, which involves assessing a number of factors &#8212; including whether there is a \u003Cem\u003Ereasonable expectation of profits due to the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fcorpfin\u002Fframework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emanagerial efforts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of others\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Take for example Bitcoin and Ethereum: While both crypto projects began with the vision of a single person, they evolved into communities of developers with no one entity in control &#8212; so potential investors don’t have to rely on anyone’s “managerial efforts”. These technologies now function like public infrastructure rather than as proprietary platforms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, other entrepreneurs building innovative projects don’t know how to qualify for the same regulatory treatment as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin (founded in 2009) and Ethereum (2013-2014) are the only significant blockchain projects to date &#8212; both established over a decade ago &#8212; that the SEC has deemed, explicitly or implicitly, as not involving managerial efforts. The SEC’s lack of candor and approach &#8212; including applying the Howey test through regulation-by-enforcement &#8212; has also led to much confusion and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fits-time-to-move-crypto-from-chaos-to-order\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Euncertainty\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in the industry. And while the Howey test is well reasoned, it is inherently subjective. The SEC has so broadly stretched the test’s meaning that ordinary assets, even something like Nike shoes, could be considered securities today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMemecoin projects, meanwhile, don’t have developers, so there’s no pretense of memecoin investors relying on the “managerial efforts” of anyone. Memecoins thus propagate, while innovative projects struggle. Investors end up facing more risk, not less.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer isn’t less regulation &#8212; it’s \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C\u002Fem\u003E regulation. Specific solutions include adding well-tailored disclosures to provide regular investors with more information. Another solution is requiring long lockup periods to prevent get-rich-quick schemes, and incentivize more long-term building.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERegulators implemented similar protections following the Great Depression, after the excesses of the roaring 1920’s and stock market crash of 1929. Once those guiderails were in place, we saw an unprecedented era of growth and innovation in our markets and economy. It’s time for regulators to learn from the mistakes of the past, and pave the way towards a better future for all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe author is general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, where he leads the crypto fund, and is author of “Read Write Own”\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA condensed version of this article originally appeared \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ft.com\u002Fcontent\u002F1ceaa1c6-47df-4430-950e-ffcbf1cc8f7b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ein The Financial Times\u003C\u002Fa\u003E online on April 18, 2024 and in print April 19, 2024. \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"}],related_posts:bc,disclosure_relation:f},tags:[{term_id:bH,name:cg,slug:ch,term_group:c,term_taxonomy_id:bH,taxonomy:m,description:b,parent:c,count:gi,filter:e},{term_id:bI,name:aQ,slug:aQ,term_group:c,term_taxonomy_id:bI,taxonomy:m,description:b,parent:c,count:gj,filter:e},{term_id:bJ,name:cm,slug:cn,term_group:c,term_taxonomy_id:bJ,taxonomy:m,description:b,parent:c,count:gk,filter:e},{term_id:s,name:p,slug:p,term_group:c,term_taxonomy_id:s,taxonomy:m,description:b,parent:c,count:C,filter:e}],post_thumbnail:"\u003Cimg width=\"1024\" height=\"472\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F04\u002Fmemecoins_tokens_regulation_a16zcrypto-1024x472.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F04\u002Fmemecoins_tokens_regulation_a16zcrypto-1024x472.png 1024w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F04\u002Fmemecoins_tokens_regulation_a16zcrypto-300x138.png 300w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F04\u002Fmemecoins_tokens_regulation_a16zcrypto-768x354.png 768w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F04\u002Fmemecoins_tokens_regulation_a16zcrypto-1536x709.png 1536w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F04\u002Fmemecoins_tokens_regulation_a16zcrypto-2048x945.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \u002F\u003E",post_thumbnail_small:"\u003Cimg width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F04\u002Fmemecoins_tokens_regulation_a16zcrypto-150x150.png\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" \u002F\u003E",post_images:[{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F04\u002Fmemecoins_tokens_regulation_a16zcrypto-150x150.png",width:N},{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F04\u002Fmemecoins_tokens_regulation_a16zcrypto-300x138.png",width:aN},{url:gl,width:aO}],authors:[{ID:"2427",display_name:"Chris Dixon",first_name:b,last_name:b,user_login:cC,user_email:b,linked_account:b,website:b,description:"\u003Cp\u003EChris Dixon is a general partner and has been at Andreessen Horowitz since 2012.

Like the SEC, it’s an independent government agency that regulates the markets but focuses on futures and options &#8212; including cryptonetwork derivatives markets, and anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation in crypto spot markets.

Going back to our diagram, we’re still only talking about the two extremes of the market lifecycle of a cryptonetwork: the early and more mature phases.

Why? During this time, trading is still being stabilized for the new entity; the stock price is still being “seasoned” by new investors; and all the information about the company should be incorporated into the stock price.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe concern is that major shareholders and insiders that sell \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C\u002Fem\u003E all of the above settles into place might do so because they have asymmetric information not generally known to the market &#8212; for instance, if an announcement about a bad breach will come out publicly in a couple months it may cause the share prices to tank! That’s why securities laws &#8212; and any open, free market for that matter &#8212; are built around a disclosure regime; the entire IPO registration process is intended to help mitigate such asymmetries. It’s therefore significant that the SEC’s Head of Corporate Finance \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fnews\u002Fspeech\u002Fspeech-hinman-061418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Esaid that\u003C\u002Fa\u003E “material information asymmetries” \u003Cem\u003Erecede\u003C\u002Fem\u003E when “the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise’s success” &#8212; as with tokens in “sufficiently decentralized” networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe asymmetry and disclosure problem can be addressed in crypto just as with an IPO (in this sense, the riff on “ICO” is not accurate), by prohibiting for a specific period insiders and early major investors from selling too early in newly “trading” networks. Retail investors who want to purchase tokens would thus be protected from the possibility that those early investors and insiders have additional information not available to the general public, and the market price of tokens would have time to be seasoned while all relevant information is incorporated into the token trading price.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EResale.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Similarly, there’s an existing rule in public markets that applies to secondary trading: SEC \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Freportspubs\u002Finvestor-publications\u002Finvestorpubsrule144htm.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ERule 144\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which governs the public re-sale of unregistered securities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmong other things, Rule 144 restricts “affiliates” &#8212; basically insiders and major shareholders &#8212; on the \u003Cem\u003Evolume\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of shares they can ultimately sell in any given three-month period. The rationale behind this limit is similar to that behind IPO lockups: Affiliated investors should not be able to dump too many shares at once given potential information asymmetry relative to the buyers of those shares. Insiders and early investors can therefore only sell after satisfying certain restrictions, including a limitation on the volume of sales &#8212; that is, they have to “dribble” out the shares over time, which is why these are called “dribble rules”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EApplying a similar dribble rule to secondary trading of newly issued cryptotokens could have similar benefits as they do with other entities in the public market.

For example, enforcing lock-ups and Rule 144 restrictions in today’s traditional security world is time-consuming, costly, and complex, involving multiple parties (Rule 144 alone requires stockholder, issuer, transfer agent, and each of their counsel). But encoding those restrictions into the tokens themselves &#8212; after all, tokens are simply programmable software &#8212; would allow the restrictions to be self-executing, thus reducing cost and ensuring compliance with the appropriate regulatory rules. In this sense, software itself could aid regulators and help further close the regulatory gap as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, however, all these frameworks should enable the dual goals of protecting investors from bad actors while still ensuring capital formation around emerging technologies&#8230; with the goal of supporting further innovation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"footnote\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe content provided here is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to purchase any investment solution or a recommendation to buy or sell a security; nor it is to be taken as legal, business, investment, or tax advice.

Given that the buyer is entirely reliant on the network sponsor to build the network, this makes sense: If the network sponsor fails to build anything, there’s no viable opportunity to realize value from the investment. It’s also far riskier for lay investors since there is often only a whitepaper on which to make an investment decision: Not only do the details shared in these papers vary greatly, as well as the expertise required to assess what’s in them, but fraud can even occur in the form of people faking code to make things look more promising than they actually are. Finally, since there’s no secondary resale market yet, there is no place for the investor to offload shares if the network never gets built.

Like the SEC, it’s an independent government agency that regulates the markets but focuses on futures and options &#8212; including cryptonetwork derivatives markets, and anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation in crypto spot markets. We recently saw the exercise of this authority with the Justice Department’s \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2018-05-24\u002Fbitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Elaunch of an investigation\u003C\u002Fa\u003E into allegations of spoofing and wash trading in the bitcoin and ether markets. In “spoofing”, traders submit a number of orders for a cryptocurrency and then, once the price moves in the desired direction, they cancel them. “Wash trades” are buy and sell orders that traders execute with themselves in an attempt to make other market participants believe that there’s significant trading activity happening in the market. Both of these activities are manipulations to contort the actual value of a commodity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince bitcoin has been declared a commodity &#8212; and, as of June 15, the SEC’s Head of Corporate Finance \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fnews\u002Fspeech\u002Fspeech-hinman-061418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Edeclared\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that ether is not a security &#8212; the CFTC has jurisdiction for that particular behavior. Assuming other tokens are ultimately also declared commodities, the CFTC will continue to have similar jurisdiction to help protect retail investors in cryptocurrencies. (Again, I’m glossing over here the many other regulatory players in the broader landscape &#8212; at both a federal and state level, as well as regulatory vs. enforcement &#8212; but for now, these are two to know of.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo where’s the “regulatory gap” then? Going back to our diagram, we’re still only talking about the two extremes of the market lifecycle of a cryptonetwork: the early and more mature phases. Everything in between is a potential gap in regulation, where we have functional utility and trading of tokens, but the network is still young and may not yet be fully decentralized.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, there are two existing analogies in the capital markets today from which we can draw some insight for how to address this protection gap:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELock-ups.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E When any company goes public, all major shareholders and insiders are required to sign a “lock-up” agreement, which generally prohibits those shareholders from selling their shares for the first six months after a company’s initial public offering (IPO). Why? During this time, trading is still being stabilized for the new entity; the stock price is still being “seasoned” by new investors; and all the information about the company should be incorporated into the stock price.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe concern is that major shareholders and insiders that sell \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C\u002Fem\u003E all of the above settles into place might do so because they have asymmetric information not generally known to the market &#8212; for instance, if an announcement about a bad breach will come out publicly in a couple months it may cause the share prices to tank! That’s why securities laws &#8212; and any open, free market for that matter &#8212; are built around a disclosure regime; the entire IPO registration process is intended to help mitigate such asymmetries. It’s therefore significant that the SEC’s Head of Corporate Finance \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fnews\u002Fspeech\u002Fspeech-hinman-061418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Esaid that\u003C\u002Fa\u003E “material information asymmetries” \u003Cem\u003Erecede\u003C\u002Fem\u003E when “the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise’s success” &#8212; as with tokens in “sufficiently decentralized” networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe asymmetry and disclosure problem can be addressed in crypto just as with an IPO (in this sense, the riff on “ICO” is not accurate), by prohibiting for a specific period insiders and early major investors from selling too early in newly “trading” networks. Retail investors who want to purchase tokens would thus be protected from the possibility that those early investors and insiders have additional information not available to the general public, and the market price of tokens would have time to be seasoned while all relevant information is incorporated into the token trading price.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EResale.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Similarly, there’s an existing rule in public markets that applies to secondary trading: SEC \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Freportspubs\u002Finvestor-publications\u002Finvestorpubsrule144htm.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ERule 144\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which governs the public re-sale of unregistered securities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmong other things, Rule 144 restricts “affiliates” &#8212; basically insiders and major shareholders &#8212; on the \u003Cem\u003Evolume\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of shares they can ultimately sell in any given three-month period. The rationale behind this limit is similar to that behind IPO lockups: Affiliated investors should not be able to dump too many shares at once given potential information asymmetry relative to the buyers of those shares. Insiders and early investors can therefore only sell after satisfying certain restrictions, including a limitation on the volume of sales &#8212; that is, they have to “dribble” out the shares over time, which is why these are called “dribble rules”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EApplying a similar dribble rule to secondary trading of newly issued cryptotokens could have similar benefits as they do with other entities in the public market.

For example, enforcing lock-ups and Rule 144 restrictions in today’s traditional security world is time-consuming, costly, and complex, involving multiple parties (Rule 144 alone requires stockholder, issuer, transfer agent, and each of their counsel). But encoding those restrictions into the tokens themselves &#8212; after all, tokens are simply programmable software &#8212; would allow the restrictions to be self-executing, thus reducing cost and ensuring compliance with the appropriate regulatory rules. In this sense, software itself could aid regulators and help further close the regulatory gap as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, however, all these frameworks should enable the dual goals of protecting investors from bad actors while still ensuring capital formation around emerging technologies&#8230; with the goal of supporting further innovation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"footnote\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe content provided here is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to purchase any investment solution or a recommendation to buy or sell a security; nor it is to be taken as legal, business, investment, or tax advice.
