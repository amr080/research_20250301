Conversely, once a product is in market, early customer expectations&#8217; become set.

Simultaneously, the startup pitches Cohort B the same offering at 5X for Good, 5Y for Better, and 5Z for Best. In this example, Cohort B&#8217;s pricing is literally five times higher than that of Cohort A. What the startup should observe, in this case, is the variation in win rate between the two cohorts.

It is also, thanks to him, one of the clearest and most comprehensive discussions of blockspace and why it matters. With that, let’s jump in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EM‍ario Gabriele: OK, Chris, maybe we can start with the basics. What is blockspace?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChris Dixon: Blockspace is space on a blockchain where you can run code and store data. Blockspace is different from traditional compute-space in that, until the advent of blockchains, software was always subordinate to hardware – and then, ultimately, to the owner of that hardware. If you write software for traditional computers, it’s the hardware owners who are in control. If Facebook writes some code and says any developer can come along and have access to a certain API, Facebook management can just change its mind and revoke access later. Because Facebook controls the hardware that the software runs on, it ultimately controls the software.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains are different in the way they&#8217;re architected: the software is in charge of the hardware. If you write software for \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F27\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eblockchains, you can write code that makes strong commitments\u003C\u002Fa\u003E; you can assure users and developers that the software will continue to run as designed. Specifically, blockchains use what&#8217;s called a consensus mechanism to make these commitments. The various hardware operators that run the network come together every so often and vote on the state of the blockchain virtual computer. There&#8217;s game theory around it that guarantees – that makes assurances under most conditions – that the software will continue to run as designed and that the integrity of the data will be maintained.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we&#8217;re seeing now is a wave of entrepreneurs and developers who are building new classes of applications that take advantage of this new computing property: that you can write code that makes strong commitments about how it’s going to behave in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat’s an interesting articulation. I haven’t seen this topic framed around the relationship between software and hardware before, but I think what we’re really talking about here is the matter of control, right?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EExactly. Let&#8217;s hypothetically say that Google introduces GoogleCoin. Google claims there will only ever be 21 million coins. But the software that powers GoogleCoin runs on servers Google controls. Because Google controls its computers, they can just change the 21 million limit to whatever they want. The software is controlled by hardware, and the hardware is controlled by Google management.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EContrast this scenario with how Bitcoin works. Bitcoin promises that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins; that scarcity is one of the factors that enables Bitcoin to have value. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F11\u002F12\u002Fthe-end-of-centralization-and-the-future-of-trust\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EYou can trust\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that Bitcoin will only ever have 21 million bitcoins because this rule is written in the Bitcoin blockchain – it&#8217;s baked into its very architecture. Even if a whole lot of the people running the Bitcoin code – the so-called Bitcoin miners – are trying to subvert those rules, it&#8217;s very, very difficult for them to do so. In the history of Bitcoin and Ethereum and other major blockchains, no one has been able to subvert those game-theoretic guarantees.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s what makes blockspace different. Developers and entrepreneurs who want to build on top of the blockchain ecosystem know what the rules are. They won’t get changed on them the way they get changed by traditional tech companies. When it comes to blockchains, instead of “don&#8217;t be evil,” it&#8217;s “can&#8217;t be evil.” The rules of the system are baked into the code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, blockspace is a unit of compute and storage that lives on blockchains and, as a result, is free from the control of hardware owners. We’ve seen many different expressions of blockspace and its surrounding mechanisms beneath that foundational definition. What do you think are the most important design considerations?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockspace exists on blockchains, and blockchains can be designed in various ways. The most important characteristic of a blockchain is its security properties. How reliable are the commitments it makes? Can you trust them? Can you trust the system can’t be subverted or hacked? That’s the most important feature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother important feature is performance. This is related to the fees you pay when you transact on a blockchain. If you can make systems that are more performant, you can lower those fees. On a blockchain like Solana, for example, one of the nice features is the fees are low because of the way it&#8217;s designed. Now, some people would argue that you make trade-offs on the security side to get that performance. But clearly, security and performance are both top priorities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother consideration is the community around the blockchain. Some blockchains are home to communities focused on software development, building new applications, and creating valuable new internet services. Ethereum comes to mind as an example of a healthy developer community. Other blockchains focus more on speculation and gambling and, I would argue, are less healthy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo blockchains are, on the one hand, computers, so their security and performance properties matter; but they&#8217;re also social networks, and they need to have healthy communities focused on building.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n‍\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen it comes to the topic of blockspace, a lot of the discussion centers around the question of scalability. We’ve all seen what happens to Ethereum when demand is high: we get congestion and steep gas fees. What do you think are the most interesting, promising ways to scale blockchains and the space they offer?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou’re right that the so-called scaling problem in blockchains is a hotly debated topic. Some blockchains, like Ethereum, have taken the view that the best way to grow blockspace is through what are called L2s, or “layer twos.” L2s are systems that sit on top of a “layer one” (L1) like Ethereum. If they&#8217;re architected correctly, L2s inherit the security properties of the lower layer – so you still have the strong security guarantees of Ethereum – but they provide additional blockspace capacity on top where applications can be run with lower gas fees. There are a few prominent L2s right now: Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Aztec, and Starkware. They all take different approaches, and they&#8217;re all in various stages of development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EL2s are one way to grow supply; another way is through system design. Solana, for example, is trying to get all of its scaling on layer one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way I think blockspace grows is just simply with more L1 blockchains. You&#8217;ve got a whole series of credible layer ones in development right now. You also have bridges coming online – ways for blockchains to interoperate, sending assets and messages back and forth. Imagine a future world where you have this fabric of blockchains, all connected, and you&#8217;re moving seamlessly from one to another, depending on various technical trade-offs and community considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are philosophical and technical arguments as to which way is the best way to grow the supply of blockspace. I would personally bet on some mix of all three big methods I just outlined.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI love this image of a “fabric of blockchains.” Maybe because it sounds like another reality, it makes me think of one of my favorite pieces I’ve read on the subject of blockspace, “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.aniccaresearch.tech\u002Fblog\u002Fconsensus-capital-markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EConsensus Capital Markets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” written by Leo Zhang and Saneel Sreeni. In the piece, Zhang and Sreeni argue that blockspace will become the “central commodity of the metaverse.” Nothing seems to suggest the need for scale more than running a parallel reality on-chain. But, I’m curious, does this make sense to you? Is the metaverse a major player in the discussion of blockspace?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let’s define the term “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.a16z.com\u002F7-essential-ingredients-of-a-metaverse\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emetaverse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.” Metaverse is a catch-all phrase that describes a series of emerging technologies. It includes web3, new interfaces like VR, and just a general progression of the internet as it becomes more immersive and more central to our lives. Put simply, the metaverse can be thought of as the next wave of the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA really important question with respect to the next wave of the internet is: will it be controlled by one big company, like Meta, in a centralized way, or will it be \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F18\u002Fwhy-decentralization-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edecentralized\u003C\u002Fa\u003E like the early web? In the decentralized case, control would be held by a collection of developers, creators, and other community participants, who all work together through common standards and systems, including blockchains. To the extent \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Fstory\u002Fhow-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ethe decentralized vision wins\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, blockchains will be extremely important as a way to set the rules of the network, hold assets and virtual goods, and store other shared information. Blockchains are the first way you can have “state” data – in the computer memory sense – on the internet that&#8217;s owned by a community as opposed to owned by a corporation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo circle back to the question, I view blockspace as a new, emerging, critical computing resource alongside traditional computing resources like bandwidth, storage, compute, etc. If the web3 vision plays out, blockspace will probably be the most important new computing resource of the 2020s.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe analogies we’re using so far are grounded in traditional computing, but I wonder what you think of other framings. For example, some argue that blockspace should really be thought of as a commodity like land, oil, or grain. (The Zhang and Sreeni piece takes this tact.) Starting from that perspective opens up new ways of reasoning by analogy. For example, since other commodities have markets, will blockspace? To what extent will we see this new “substance” get financialized?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost blockspace will not be fungible, in my view, which will limit the financialization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile blockspace may be fungible within a single chain, between blockchains, there will be technical trade-offs in areas such as security and performance. More importantly, different blockchains have different communities around them. Therefore, it will mean something different to have a virtual good or a game on one blockchain versus another, in the same way, that it&#8217;s different to post on LinkedIn versus Facebook versus Twitter. Different networks, different contexts and communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI expect we’ll see new innovations that help make the experience of bidding for blockspace more efficient and fair. There are already gas auction systems that financialize blockspace within single blockchains like Ethereum. But I think more broadly, there will be a tapestry of blockchains. Different blockchains will have different communities, and there generally won’t be fungible assets across blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou mention improvements around bidding, but I imagine there are many other innovations you expect to see. I’m curious to hear what excites you most these days. Where do you see the opportunity?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re continuing to see innovation in core L1 blockchains. For example, there are a couple of projects that spun out of Meta we&#8217;re involved with that have interesting new distributed systems innovations. On the programming language side, there are interesting developments. For example, I’m excited about a new language called Move, which has some nice security properties. There&#8217;s a lot of interesting stuff happening around zero knowledge proofs as ways to improve both the performance and the privacy properties of blockchains. We’re making active investments there. There&#8217;s a bunch of exciting stuff happening at layer two, as mentioned above. Bridges are really important, too, to tie it all together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe still need improvements to the onboarding experience for new users. There are a whole bunch of user-experience friction points across wallets, custody, key recovery, and key management that need to be reduced. There’s also a constant need for better security and performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI expect blockchains to follow a pattern common to previous computing waves: there will be a reinforcing feedback loop between infrastructure and applications. As more applications are created, that creates greater demand for infrastructure. As the infrastructure gets better, that unlocks new applications. Economists call this “induced demand.” It&#8217;s why, when you build another lane on a highway, often you end up with more traffic; people build more stores and buildings in the area, attracting more traffic. A similar dynamic will play out with blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe there will be an unending appetite – and opportunity – for more infrastructure innovation and scaling over the next 10-to-20 years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat feels like the perfect segue to talk about the statement that originally sparked my interest in this topic. On the Bankless \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fshows.banklesshq.com\u002Fp\u002F-90-5-mental-models-for-web3-chris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epodcast\u003C\u002Fa\u003E back in November of last year, you said, “I think blockspace is the best product to be selling in the 2020s.” What did you mean by that, and what should other builders and investors take away from those words?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESelling blockspace in the 2020s will be a good business in the same way that selling PCs and broadband was in the 1990s and 2000s and that selling mobile phones was in the last decade. Whenever there&#8217;s a breakout computing wave, you get a reinforcing feedback loop that leads to exponential growth. When you’re in that cycle, it&#8217;s generally very good to be selling one of the high-quality products that people are clamoring to get. I think that will be the case for high-quality blockspace in the next decade.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1990s, there was a huge wave of investment in bandwidth, specifically in long haul fiber and switching gear. Then there was a huge collapse, and it all went under-utilized. I remember very clearly in the early 2000s, there were a lot of pessimists who said this infrastructure would never get used. At the time, you didn&#8217;t have Netflix streaming; you didn&#8217;t have YouTube streaming; you didn&#8217;t have real internet video. The internet was basically email and some web pages. So people said: Why would you want to pay 50 bucks a month or whatever for broadband just to get faster email and websites? What the pessimists underestimated was that as more broadband came online, developers and entrepreneurs would invent all sorts of great things to do with it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAround 2005, that&#8217;s when you had the launch of things like YouTube. That’s when you really started to see this flywheel kick in where the applications got better and the broadband got better. Then came the mobile wave with the iPhone in 2007, which further accelerated it. It all kind of hit. Cloud computing and social networking suddenly matured, and it led to a decade of really rapid technological improvement and expansion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that it looks like we&#8217;re entering a financial downturn – maybe analogous to the early 2000s. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw a lot of pessimists say: look at all the stuff we built that’s not very useful. But this is exactly the time when we could be entering an entrepreneurial golden period. Now is the time to go figure out: what is the YouTube or Netflix of blockspace? What are the killer apps that are going to drive this wave of computing forward? The apps may exist today already. They may be new things that don’t yet exist. We don’t know. That&#8217;s what makes this period fun and exciting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris Dixon\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is a general partner at a16z, where he leads the crypto\u002F web3 funds.

It is also, thanks to him, one of the clearest and most comprehensive discussions of blockspace and why it matters. With that, let’s jump in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EM‍ario Gabriele: OK, Chris, maybe we can start with the basics. What is blockspace?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChris Dixon: Blockspace is space on a blockchain where you can run code and store data. Blockspace is different from traditional compute-space in that, until the advent of blockchains, software was always subordinate to hardware – and then, ultimately, to the owner of that hardware. If you write software for traditional computers, it’s the hardware owners who are in control. If Facebook writes some code and says any developer can come along and have access to a certain API, Facebook management can just change its mind and revoke access later. Because Facebook controls the hardware that the software runs on, it ultimately controls the software.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains are different in the way they&#8217;re architected: the software is in charge of the hardware. If you write software for \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F27\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eblockchains, you can write code that makes strong commitments\u003C\u002Fa\u003E; you can assure users and developers that the software will continue to run as designed. Specifically, blockchains use what&#8217;s called a consensus mechanism to make these commitments. The various hardware operators that run the network come together every so often and vote on the state of the blockchain virtual computer. There&#8217;s game theory around it that guarantees – that makes assurances under most conditions – that the software will continue to run as designed and that the integrity of the data will be maintained.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we&#8217;re seeing now is a wave of entrepreneurs and developers who are building new classes of applications that take advantage of this new computing property: that you can write code that makes strong commitments about how it’s going to behave in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat’s an interesting articulation. I haven’t seen this topic framed around the relationship between software and hardware before, but I think what we’re really talking about here is the matter of control, right?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EExactly. Let&#8217;s hypothetically say that Google introduces GoogleCoin. Google claims there will only ever be 21 million coins. But the software that powers GoogleCoin runs on servers Google controls. Because Google controls its computers, they can just change the 21 million limit to whatever they want. The software is controlled by hardware, and the hardware is controlled by Google management.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EContrast this scenario with how Bitcoin works. Bitcoin promises that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins; that scarcity is one of the factors that enables Bitcoin to have value. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F11\u002F12\u002Fthe-end-of-centralization-and-the-future-of-trust\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EYou can trust\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that Bitcoin will only ever have 21 million bitcoins because this rule is written in the Bitcoin blockchain – it&#8217;s baked into its very architecture. Even if a whole lot of the people running the Bitcoin code – the so-called Bitcoin miners – are trying to subvert those rules, it&#8217;s very, very difficult for them to do so. In the history of Bitcoin and Ethereum and other major blockchains, no one has been able to subvert those game-theoretic guarantees.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s what makes blockspace different. Developers and entrepreneurs who want to build on top of the blockchain ecosystem know what the rules are. They won’t get changed on them the way they get changed by traditional tech companies. When it comes to blockchains, instead of “don&#8217;t be evil,” it&#8217;s “can&#8217;t be evil.” The rules of the system are baked into the code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, blockspace is a unit of compute and storage that lives on blockchains and, as a result, is free from the control of hardware owners. We’ve seen many different expressions of blockspace and its surrounding mechanisms beneath that foundational definition. What do you think are the most important design considerations?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockspace exists on blockchains, and blockchains can be designed in various ways. The most important characteristic of a blockchain is its security properties. How reliable are the commitments it makes? Can you trust them? Can you trust the system can’t be subverted or hacked? That’s the most important feature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother important feature is performance. This is related to the fees you pay when you transact on a blockchain. If you can make systems that are more performant, you can lower those fees. On a blockchain like Solana, for example, one of the nice features is the fees are low because of the way it&#8217;s designed. Now, some people would argue that you make trade-offs on the security side to get that performance. But clearly, security and performance are both top priorities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother consideration is the community around the blockchain. Some blockchains are home to communities focused on software development, building new applications, and creating valuable new internet services. Ethereum comes to mind as an example of a healthy developer community. Other blockchains focus more on speculation and gambling and, I would argue, are less healthy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo blockchains are, on the one hand, computers, so their security and performance properties matter; but they&#8217;re also social networks, and they need to have healthy communities focused on building.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n‍\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen it comes to the topic of blockspace, a lot of the discussion centers around the question of scalability. We’ve all seen what happens to Ethereum when demand is high: we get congestion and steep gas fees. What do you think are the most interesting, promising ways to scale blockchains and the space they offer?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou’re right that the so-called scaling problem in blockchains is a hotly debated topic. Some blockchains, like Ethereum, have taken the view that the best way to grow blockspace is through what are called L2s, or “layer twos.” L2s are systems that sit on top of a “layer one” (L1) like Ethereum. If they&#8217;re architected correctly, L2s inherit the security properties of the lower layer – so you still have the strong security guarantees of Ethereum – but they provide additional blockspace capacity on top where applications can be run with lower gas fees. There are a few prominent L2s right now: Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Aztec, and Starkware. They all take different approaches, and they&#8217;re all in various stages of development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EL2s are one way to grow supply; another way is through system design. Solana, for example, is trying to get all of its scaling on layer one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way I think blockspace grows is just simply with more L1 blockchains. You&#8217;ve got a whole series of credible layer ones in development right now. You also have bridges coming online – ways for blockchains to interoperate, sending assets and messages back and forth. Imagine a future world where you have this fabric of blockchains, all connected, and you&#8217;re moving seamlessly from one to another, depending on various technical trade-offs and community considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are philosophical and technical arguments as to which way is the best way to grow the supply of blockspace. I would personally bet on some mix of all three big methods I just outlined.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI love this image of a “fabric of blockchains.” Maybe because it sounds like another reality, it makes me think of one of my favorite pieces I’ve read on the subject of blockspace, “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.aniccaresearch.tech\u002Fblog\u002Fconsensus-capital-markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EConsensus Capital Markets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” written by Leo Zhang and Saneel Sreeni. In the piece, Zhang and Sreeni argue that blockspace will become the “central commodity of the metaverse.” Nothing seems to suggest the need for scale more than running a parallel reality on-chain. But, I’m curious, does this make sense to you? Is the metaverse a major player in the discussion of blockspace?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let’s define the term “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.a16z.com\u002F7-essential-ingredients-of-a-metaverse\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emetaverse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.” Metaverse is a catch-all phrase that describes a series of emerging technologies. It includes web3, new interfaces like VR, and just a general progression of the internet as it becomes more immersive and more central to our lives. Put simply, the metaverse can be thought of as the next wave of the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA really important question with respect to the next wave of the internet is: will it be controlled by one big company, like Meta, in a centralized way, or will it be \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F18\u002Fwhy-decentralization-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edecentralized\u003C\u002Fa\u003E like the early web? In the decentralized case, control would be held by a collection of developers, creators, and other community participants, who all work together through common standards and systems, including blockchains. To the extent \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Fstory\u002Fhow-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ethe decentralized vision wins\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, blockchains will be extremely important as a way to set the rules of the network, hold assets and virtual goods, and store other shared information. Blockchains are the first way you can have “state” data – in the computer memory sense – on the internet that&#8217;s owned by a community as opposed to owned by a corporation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo circle back to the question, I view blockspace as a new, emerging, critical computing resource alongside traditional computing resources like bandwidth, storage, compute, etc. If the web3 vision plays out, blockspace will probably be the most important new computing resource of the 2020s.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe analogies we’re using so far are grounded in traditional computing, but I wonder what you think of other framings. For example, some argue that blockspace should really be thought of as a commodity like land, oil, or grain. (The Zhang and Sreeni piece takes this tact.) Starting from that perspective opens up new ways of reasoning by analogy. For example, since other commodities have markets, will blockspace? To what extent will we see this new “substance” get financialized?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost blockspace will not be fungible, in my view, which will limit the financialization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile blockspace may be fungible within a single chain, between blockchains, there will be technical trade-offs in areas such as security and performance. More importantly, different blockchains have different communities around them. Therefore, it will mean something different to have a virtual good or a game on one blockchain versus another, in the same way, that it&#8217;s different to post on LinkedIn versus Facebook versus Twitter. Different networks, different contexts and communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI expect we’ll see new innovations that help make the experience of bidding for blockspace more efficient and fair. There are already gas auction systems that financialize blockspace within single blockchains like Ethereum. But I think more broadly, there will be a tapestry of blockchains. Different blockchains will have different communities, and there generally won’t be fungible assets across blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou mention improvements around bidding, but I imagine there are many other innovations you expect to see. I’m curious to hear what excites you most these days. Where do you see the opportunity?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re continuing to see innovation in core L1 blockchains. For example, there are a couple of projects that spun out of Meta we&#8217;re involved with that have interesting new distributed systems innovations. On the programming language side, there are interesting developments. For example, I’m excited about a new language called Move, which has some nice security properties. There&#8217;s a lot of interesting stuff happening around zero knowledge proofs as ways to improve both the performance and the privacy properties of blockchains. We’re making active investments there. There&#8217;s a bunch of exciting stuff happening at layer two, as mentioned above. Bridges are really important, too, to tie it all together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe still need improvements to the onboarding experience for new users. There are a whole bunch of user-experience friction points across wallets, custody, key recovery, and key management that need to be reduced. There’s also a constant need for better security and performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI expect blockchains to follow a pattern common to previous computing waves: there will be a reinforcing feedback loop between infrastructure and applications. As more applications are created, that creates greater demand for infrastructure. As the infrastructure gets better, that unlocks new applications. Economists call this “induced demand.” It&#8217;s why, when you build another lane on a highway, often you end up with more traffic; people build more stores and buildings in the area, attracting more traffic. A similar dynamic will play out with blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe there will be an unending appetite – and opportunity – for more infrastructure innovation and scaling over the next 10-to-20 years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat feels like the perfect segue to talk about the statement that originally sparked my interest in this topic. On the Bankless \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fshows.banklesshq.com\u002Fp\u002F-90-5-mental-models-for-web3-chris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epodcast\u003C\u002Fa\u003E back in November of last year, you said, “I think blockspace is the best product to be selling in the 2020s.” What did you mean by that, and what should other builders and investors take away from those words?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESelling blockspace in the 2020s will be a good business in the same way that selling PCs and broadband was in the 1990s and 2000s and that selling mobile phones was in the last decade. Whenever there&#8217;s a breakout computing wave, you get a reinforcing feedback loop that leads to exponential growth. When you’re in that cycle, it&#8217;s generally very good to be selling one of the high-quality products that people are clamoring to get. I think that will be the case for high-quality blockspace in the next decade.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1990s, there was a huge wave of investment in bandwidth, specifically in long haul fiber and switching gear. Then there was a huge collapse, and it all went under-utilized. I remember very clearly in the early 2000s, there were a lot of pessimists who said this infrastructure would never get used. At the time, you didn&#8217;t have Netflix streaming; you didn&#8217;t have YouTube streaming; you didn&#8217;t have real internet video. The internet was basically email and some web pages. So people said: Why would you want to pay 50 bucks a month or whatever for broadband just to get faster email and websites? What the pessimists underestimated was that as more broadband came online, developers and entrepreneurs would invent all sorts of great things to do with it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAround 2005, that&#8217;s when you had the launch of things like YouTube. That’s when you really started to see this flywheel kick in where the applications got better and the broadband got better. Then came the mobile wave with the iPhone in 2007, which further accelerated it. It all kind of hit. Cloud computing and social networking suddenly matured, and it led to a decade of really rapid technological improvement and expansion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that it looks like we&#8217;re entering a financial downturn – maybe analogous to the early 2000s. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw a lot of pessimists say: look at all the stuff we built that’s not very useful. But this is exactly the time when we could be entering an entrepreneurial golden period. Now is the time to go figure out: what is the YouTube or Netflix of blockspace? What are the killer apps that are going to drive this wave of computing forward? The apps may exist today already. They may be new things that don’t yet exist. We don’t know. That&#8217;s what makes this period fun and exciting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris Dixon\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is a general partner at a16z, where he leads the crypto\u002F web3 funds.

I&#8217;m Jon. I&#8217;m a general partner at a16z. Today we are talking about topics that I know are near and dear, and on everyone&#8217;s minds here at GDC, which are NFTs, Web3, and the impact in games. So, I&#8217;m honored to be joined by two luminaries in the Web3 games industry. Aleks Larsen, the cofounder and COO of Sky Mavis, which is behind Axie Infinity, and Gabby Dizon, the cofounder of Yield Guild Games.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet&#8217;s jump into it. Aleks and Gabby, we&#8217;ve heard a lot this past year about how NFTs and Web3 games are totally going to change the way people game, and the way the industry evolves. Let&#8217;s break it down into specifics. First, from a player perspective, what are some of the things that we can do today with NFTs or other Web3 primitives that were not possible before?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Speaking as a player from a developing country, the Philippines has always been one of the soft launch countries for games because there&#8217;s a lot of people who like to play who are very active on the social side. But people weren&#8217;t always able to receive real-world rewards for the time and skill they spent in-game. Now with NFTs in games, people can own their assets, and then participate in the game economy. So, that&#8217;s been huge for people from my country and other developing markets that have been able to participate in game economies, such as in Axie Infinity. It has allowed them to own digital assets that have their own value in the form of NFTs, like Axies or tokens. It&#8217;s just really changed the way people look at games. I think almost 2% of Filipinos play Axie Infinity, so it&#8217;s been a huge game-changer for the entire population.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think one of the things we see in Axie is higher engagement, retention, and that people actually care more about these assets more than they did in the past when they were leased by the game studios. When we&#8217;re looking at what an NFT actually is, it&#8217;s a part of your digital identity. So, I truly believe that part of why we made Axie and Sky Mavis is that we want people to own their own data. And when you&#8217;re starting your journey online, especially younger people, a lot of that is in games. Whenever you play a game, I firmly believe that you should have something that belongs to you. And this is represented by an NFT.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat has meaning for many people. And it&#8217;s not actually only about the monetary value. It&#8217;s about the emotional connection that people have to these game assets. That in the past, you used to just disappear if the games shut down. Now, at least you have some tangible proof that, &#8220;Hey, I actually did this in that game.&#8221; That has meaning. So, to me, that&#8217;s really important. And I think that was never really possible before, at least in the same way that we see now. So while the money is what draws people in, I believe that they will stay for everything else that&#8217;s surrounding these, and making them unique.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s very interesting that one of the first things that you mentioned was ownership. The concept that these are digital assets that no one can take away from you. If the game shuts down, if Axie Infinity closes tomorrow, your Axies would still be in your wallet. You can trade them and they have some intrinsic value. A common pushback that we get from Web2 developers, of which there are many in the audience today, is that digital ownership might just be a policy change that Web2 game developers could make for an existing game. For example, in World of Warcraft, they could just allow people to trade accounts with gold. In Diablo, there was a real money auction house for a time period, where people could buy and sell weapons and armors that they found in game. If you could take it one level deeper, what is it beyond just the ability to own and trade your digital items that is special about Web3 and NFTs?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It actually ties to what I said in terms of identity. Players are spending years grinding for game assets in games like World of Warcraft. The items they acquire have value to them, because of the time it took to get them, rather than y for the sales value. If they then quit the game but want to come back later to prove to someone that they did all these cool things it’s not certain they are there. The game developer could easily have deleted those game assets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. NFTs are digital property. It&#8217;s the digital analogue of owning a Magic card, or owning a baseball. You can play by different kinds of rules, or flavors of magic with Magic cards. You can also completely make up your own game around those assets. And the same thing goes with baseball. You can play it in a structured way with your friends, or you can play it in your backyard. Having NFTs transfers that concept of having digital ownership to the digital world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And from a developer&#8217;s perspective, if you are building games today, how should they be thinking about NFTs and exploring Web3? We&#8217;re seeing a massive flight of game developers moving from the Web2 world into Web3. What is it that&#8217;s motivating them? What&#8217;s exciting?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E We speak to a lot of game developers and they&#8217;re curious. “How did this innovation happen? What is the 2-token model? What is SLP?” Truth be told, a lot of it is just about experimentation, and trying to figure out what this new technology enables. For game developers coming into the space, they have to view tokens really, really carefully. And I emphasize to many entrepreneurs, especially those who are trying to raise money by selling tokens, just how important these tokens are. Because the liquidity that players immediately have, or investors immediately have, is something that you as a game studio or developer will have to defend over time.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nRather than selling NFTs, just as a light cash grab, it&#8217;s much better to actually reward early community members, and tie them into your community by giving them NFTs. And I think that actually flips the script. Because the moment that you&#8217;re selling something to a player, they feel like you owe them something. But the moment that you give something to a player, they feel like they almost owe you something in return. And that feeling of gratitude is insanely strong. And that&#8217;s how you can actually start building some very core communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E My take on the difference between Web2 to Web3 is that you really start with the assets as the base layer—the NFT is your base layer for IP, for intellectual property. Instead of thinking of the game, and then thinking of what assets you can put there, you actually think of what is the base asset itself? Let&#8217;s take Yuga Labs, for example. You have the Bored Ape, and then from there, you get airdropped Serum. And then you can create a second NFT, which is the Mutant. So, you&#8217;re actually creating your world one-by-one from those assets. And when you have that base asset, you can think, what does it mean to create a three-month game experience for my community, or a six-month game experience, or a two-year game experience? Maybe an MMO that takes five years to build. All using that same base layer of assets to reward your community, not only with different experiences, but also different assets that they can get from holding your base asset.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I find Yuga Labs and what they&#8217;re doing with ApeCoin to be really fascinating, because I think it&#8217;s a great example of bottom-up game building. They&#8217;ve basically given the community a set of primitives, the NFTs themselves, and told them, &#8220;Hey, we want to build a universe around this.&#8221; And then they&#8217;ve given commercial rights, in many cases, to the NFT holders. How do you reconcile that with the traditional model of game development? When you have a centralized game studio, an organization like Sky Mavis, which maintains a creative vision that&#8217;s balanced in the game, to make sure that things are fun to play, there are no cheaters, and so on, do you feel like these approaches are at odds? How do they reconcile?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The Sky Mavis approach is actually hybrid in a sense. When I&#8217;m looking at Yuga Labs, what are they doing? They&#8217;re giving away the commercial rights to use Apes in various things. Which is great–you can unlock creativity. As a game developer from the start, we are trying to progressively decentralize. At Axie, users can earn significant monetary value, but if they want to participate deeper in the ecosystem, they will need an agreement with us. We&#8217;re trying to make it so that the incentives are aligned with those who hold the underlying token, like the AXS, in our case. And the revenue that is generated, that either goes back to the players, or it gets put into our treasury, which then benefits the token holders.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nNow, for ApeCoin, I have stronger opinions about that because I&#8217;m not bullish on currency tokens. I believe that tokens need to have a clear way for people to collect some kind of value, whether that be money streams or to govern the platform. Just using them for trade or bartering is not really something that I believe will make the price go up, which is what a lot of this is actually about. I would rather focus on, especially if you&#8217;re issuing a token, why do people want to hold this? Make it so that people want to hold your asset for a long period of time, rather than just having it as a currency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s really difficult to build a game. But there&#8217;s a lot of things that NFTs and Web3 communities empower. One of my favorite examples is RTFKT and CloneX, which just started as a bunch of NFTs. But then they dropped another NFT, Space Pods, which is like a physical 3D space that people can decorate. A lot of people have actually entered as creators, and are decorating their own pods, and even learning Blender to do so. So, having your community feel like, &#8220;I am a real owner of this economy, and I can co-create with the developers.&#8221; And of course, you can set some boundaries there. There&#8217;s a core game experience that only the developer can create.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8230;. But if you can create a sandbox for the community to be really playful, and to have ownership, you&#8217;ll really see long-term loyalty that you won&#8217;t be able to see in any other kind of game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One of the challenges that we have today in Web3 is that there just aren&#8217;t that many players. To use a personal example, two nights ago I beat Elden Ring, which is a best-selling premium console game. They recently announced that 12 million people played Elden Ring last month. To the best of my knowledge though, there isn&#8217;t yet a blockchain game with 12 million players cumulative, let alone on a monthly active basis. What do you think needs to happen in order to have an Elden Ring level of success in blockchain gaming?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right now in Axie, we have about 1.6 million daily active players. And that is without having the game on any app stores. You can&#8217;t download the game on iOS. The only way to get it on Android is to have the APK downloaded directly. Having said that, what happens when we can reduce the barriers of entry even more? And it&#8217;s not about earning a whole lot of money as a developer, it&#8217;s about giving something back because forever gamers have been taken for granted, and actually exploited. They&#8217;re being squeezed to the max, especially by mobile game studios.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m a mobile game developer, by the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Speaking as a mobile game developer right now, we went down that path and figured out that it&#8217;s actually not the game developers who are the worst. It&#8217;s the middlemen. It&#8217;s the way that you have to spend money on ads. Now, what&#8217;s possible with blockchain games is that you can go to market directly to the consumer by dropping tokens, which is why Axie Infinity has been able to get so many users in such a short period of time. We went from 36,000 to now 2.5 million by the end of last year. By reducing the barriers even more, people are able to play for free but still experience the magic that&#8217;s surrounding Axie. That&#8217;s what it’ll take to get to those numbers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I represent how players are now engaging with gaming guilds, so I’ll talk about that. We started YGG on top of the Axie community. The community figured out that you could actually lend NFTs to other people without giving wallet access away, basically, by this kind of two-login system. If I gave you access to a username and password, without giving you access to my blockchain wallet, you could play the game, experience the game, and earn value without having to trust the person with your assets. So, we did that starting 2020 and now this has really blown up with Axie Infinity in the Philippines and other parts of the world. We are kind of set up as a player community, or run as a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) that is now purchasing assets of different kinds of games. We&#8217;ve bought assets in over 40 games now. Whether it&#8217;s a card game, or strategy, or RPG, we now have the assets for players to come in and enjoy these games, and earn it without having to buy an NFT to start. Of course, if they like it a lot, then they might buy something afterwards.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nWe&#8217;re seeing now that YGG has grown tremendously, a lot of it in developing areas such as Southeast Asia, India, Latin America, where people are playing these games and earning supplemental income. But I think we&#8217;re going to see an evolution similar to a World of Warcraft guild with a bank account. The guild itself may buy a castle or a kingdom, and it will produce buildings. And people will come in and harvest resources. The competitive people will be fighters that will be doing PvP against other people. So, having that kind of guild layer on top of digital assets gives you new gameplay primitives to play with that you&#8217;ve never seen before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Gabby, on the topic of DAOs, maybe just one contentious question… have DAOs today basically become web3 game publishers? If you&#8217;re working on a new Web3 game, you want YGG to take a look at the token design, to go through the game design docs and sign off on it. And that way, your community, your scholars and scholarship managers, will all know that this is a legitimate project and they should put their time and money behind it. Do you think there is a world where DAOs actually become too powerful in that perspective? Because they&#8217;ve actually become gatekeepers to future Web3 games and dApps in general, even outside of games. How do you think about that as you&#8217;re structuring your company and growing?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a really good question. I think the way to win and create value in Web3 is very different from how it was before. Before, if you had something proprietary, you wanted to gate it and charge for it, which is why Facebook and Google grew really big on top of their algorithms. In Web3, the way you grow is by compounding network effects, which means that if YGG comes in and helps a game launch, helps with a token design, and buys assets, we&#8217;re not going to gatekeep and not let other guilds in. We&#8217;re actually setting the design so that hundreds of other guilds can come in, enjoy the game, and have a thriving economy. We actually reduce the network effect, and therefore the value of what we&#8217;re doing, by gatekeeping. This is really the core difference in creating value between Web2 to Web3.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One final question for each of you, which is that there are a lot of Web2 developers in the audience who are crypto-curious, and want to learn more about Web3. What general advice would you have for them? How should they get started?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I would make sure that fundamentally the game that you&#8217;re designing is fun. That it can benefit from having an open or player-owned economy. And that the IP that you&#8217;re trying to create has the potential to grow outside of just being that one thing. So, truth be told, NFTs are primitives that can be used as building blocks.t. The experiences are unlimited, if you do it right. But you need to start somewhere, so I would say start from the fundamentals and go from there. Don&#8217;t get dragged into all of the hype around raising rounds before you&#8217;re ready.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Understanding the difference of the value of community in Web2 to Web3 is just so crucial to creating your game. Community has always been valuable in games, right? But in Web3, they can actually make or break your game. So, join a DAO, join the community, join a guild, and vote on some proposals. Or experience the game from the perspective of a DAO, which really gives you an idea of how powerful the network effects are of having digital assets that are owned by your player community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thank you, everyone, for joining us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FGDC-Event-1.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-310766\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FGDC-Event-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"665\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

I&#8217;m Jon. I&#8217;m a general partner at a16z. Today we are talking about topics that I know are near and dear, and on everyone&#8217;s minds here at GDC, which are NFTs, Web3, and the impact in games. So, I&#8217;m honored to be joined by two luminaries in the Web3 games industry. Aleks Larsen, the cofounder and COO of Sky Mavis, which is behind Axie Infinity, and Gabby Dizon, the cofounder of Yield Guild Games.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet&#8217;s jump into it. Aleks and Gabby, we&#8217;ve heard a lot this past year about how NFTs and Web3 games are totally going to change the way people game, and the way the industry evolves. Let&#8217;s break it down into specifics. First, from a player perspective, what are some of the things that we can do today with NFTs or other Web3 primitives that were not possible before?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Speaking as a player from a developing country, the Philippines has always been one of the soft launch countries for games because there&#8217;s a lot of people who like to play who are very active on the social side. But people weren&#8217;t always able to receive real-world rewards for the time and skill they spent in-game. Now with NFTs in games, people can own their assets, and then participate in the game economy. So, that&#8217;s been huge for people from my country and other developing markets that have been able to participate in game economies, such as in Axie Infinity. It has allowed them to own digital assets that have their own value in the form of NFTs, like Axies or tokens. It&#8217;s just really changed the way people look at games. I think almost 2% of Filipinos play Axie Infinity, so it&#8217;s been a huge game-changer for the entire population.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think one of the things we see in Axie is higher engagement, retention, and that people actually care more about these assets more than they did in the past when they were leased by the game studios. When we&#8217;re looking at what an NFT actually is, it&#8217;s a part of your digital identity. So, I truly believe that part of why we made Axie and Sky Mavis is that we want people to own their own data. And when you&#8217;re starting your journey online, especially younger people, a lot of that is in games. Whenever you play a game, I firmly believe that you should have something that belongs to you. And this is represented by an NFT.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat has meaning for many people. And it&#8217;s not actually only about the monetary value. It&#8217;s about the emotional connection that people have to these game assets. That in the past, you used to just disappear if the games shut down. Now, at least you have some tangible proof that, &#8220;Hey, I actually did this in that game.&#8221; That has meaning. So, to me, that&#8217;s really important. And I think that was never really possible before, at least in the same way that we see now. So while the money is what draws people in, I believe that they will stay for everything else that&#8217;s surrounding these, and making them unique.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s very interesting that one of the first things that you mentioned was ownership. The concept that these are digital assets that no one can take away from you. If the game shuts down, if Axie Infinity closes tomorrow, your Axies would still be in your wallet. You can trade them and they have some intrinsic value. A common pushback that we get from Web2 developers, of which there are many in the audience today, is that digital ownership might just be a policy change that Web2 game developers could make for an existing game. For example, in World of Warcraft, they could just allow people to trade accounts with gold. In Diablo, there was a real money auction house for a time period, where people could buy and sell weapons and armors that they found in game. If you could take it one level deeper, what is it beyond just the ability to own and trade your digital items that is special about Web3 and NFTs?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It actually ties to what I said in terms of identity. Players are spending years grinding for game assets in games like World of Warcraft. The items they acquire have value to them, because of the time it took to get them, rather than y for the sales value. If they then quit the game but want to come back later to prove to someone that they did all these cool things it’s not certain they are there. The game developer could easily have deleted those game assets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. NFTs are digital property. It&#8217;s the digital analogue of owning a Magic card, or owning a baseball. You can play by different kinds of rules, or flavors of magic with Magic cards. You can also completely make up your own game around those assets. And the same thing goes with baseball. You can play it in a structured way with your friends, or you can play it in your backyard. Having NFTs transfers that concept of having digital ownership to the digital world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And from a developer&#8217;s perspective, if you are building games today, how should they be thinking about NFTs and exploring Web3? We&#8217;re seeing a massive flight of game developers moving from the Web2 world into Web3. What is it that&#8217;s motivating them? What&#8217;s exciting?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E We speak to a lot of game developers and they&#8217;re curious. “How did this innovation happen? What is the 2-token model? What is SLP?” Truth be told, a lot of it is just about experimentation, and trying to figure out what this new technology enables. For game developers coming into the space, they have to view tokens really, really carefully. And I emphasize to many entrepreneurs, especially those who are trying to raise money by selling tokens, just how important these tokens are. Because the liquidity that players immediately have, or investors immediately have, is something that you as a game studio or developer will have to defend over time.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nRather than selling NFTs, just as a light cash grab, it&#8217;s much better to actually reward early community members, and tie them into your community by giving them NFTs. And I think that actually flips the script. Because the moment that you&#8217;re selling something to a player, they feel like you owe them something. But the moment that you give something to a player, they feel like they almost owe you something in return. And that feeling of gratitude is insanely strong. And that&#8217;s how you can actually start building some very core communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E My take on the difference between Web2 to Web3 is that you really start with the assets as the base layer—the NFT is your base layer for IP, for intellectual property. Instead of thinking of the game, and then thinking of what assets you can put there, you actually think of what is the base asset itself? Let&#8217;s take Yuga Labs, for example. You have the Bored Ape, and then from there, you get airdropped Serum. And then you can create a second NFT, which is the Mutant. So, you&#8217;re actually creating your world one-by-one from those assets. And when you have that base asset, you can think, what does it mean to create a three-month game experience for my community, or a six-month game experience, or a two-year game experience? Maybe an MMO that takes five years to build. All using that same base layer of assets to reward your community, not only with different experiences, but also different assets that they can get from holding your base asset.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I find Yuga Labs and what they&#8217;re doing with ApeCoin to be really fascinating, because I think it&#8217;s a great example of bottom-up game building. They&#8217;ve basically given the community a set of primitives, the NFTs themselves, and told them, &#8220;Hey, we want to build a universe around this.&#8221; And then they&#8217;ve given commercial rights, in many cases, to the NFT holders. How do you reconcile that with the traditional model of game development? When you have a centralized game studio, an organization like Sky Mavis, which maintains a creative vision that&#8217;s balanced in the game, to make sure that things are fun to play, there are no cheaters, and so on, do you feel like these approaches are at odds? How do they reconcile?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The Sky Mavis approach is actually hybrid in a sense. When I&#8217;m looking at Yuga Labs, what are they doing? They&#8217;re giving away the commercial rights to use Apes in various things. Which is great–you can unlock creativity. As a game developer from the start, we are trying to progressively decentralize. At Axie, users can earn significant monetary value, but if they want to participate deeper in the ecosystem, they will need an agreement with us. We&#8217;re trying to make it so that the incentives are aligned with those who hold the underlying token, like the AXS, in our case. And the revenue that is generated, that either goes back to the players, or it gets put into our treasury, which then benefits the token holders.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nNow, for ApeCoin, I have stronger opinions about that because I&#8217;m not bullish on currency tokens. I believe that tokens need to have a clear way for people to collect some kind of value, whether that be money streams or to govern the platform. Just using them for trade or bartering is not really something that I believe will make the price go up, which is what a lot of this is actually about. I would rather focus on, especially if you&#8217;re issuing a token, why do people want to hold this? Make it so that people want to hold your asset for a long period of time, rather than just having it as a currency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s really difficult to build a game. But there&#8217;s a lot of things that NFTs and Web3 communities empower. One of my favorite examples is RTFKT and CloneX, which just started as a bunch of NFTs. But then they dropped another NFT, Space Pods, which is like a physical 3D space that people can decorate. A lot of people have actually entered as creators, and are decorating their own pods, and even learning Blender to do so. So, having your community feel like, &#8220;I am a real owner of this economy, and I can co-create with the developers.&#8221; And of course, you can set some boundaries there. There&#8217;s a core game experience that only the developer can create.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8230;. But if you can create a sandbox for the community to be really playful, and to have ownership, you&#8217;ll really see long-term loyalty that you won&#8217;t be able to see in any other kind of game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One of the challenges that we have today in Web3 is that there just aren&#8217;t that many players. To use a personal example, two nights ago I beat Elden Ring, which is a best-selling premium console game. They recently announced that 12 million people played Elden Ring last month. To the best of my knowledge though, there isn&#8217;t yet a blockchain game with 12 million players cumulative, let alone on a monthly active basis. What do you think needs to happen in order to have an Elden Ring level of success in blockchain gaming?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right now in Axie, we have about 1.6 million daily active players. And that is without having the game on any app stores. You can&#8217;t download the game on iOS. The only way to get it on Android is to have the APK downloaded directly. Having said that, what happens when we can reduce the barriers of entry even more? And it&#8217;s not about earning a whole lot of money as a developer, it&#8217;s about giving something back because forever gamers have been taken for granted, and actually exploited. They&#8217;re being squeezed to the max, especially by mobile game studios.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m a mobile game developer, by the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Speaking as a mobile game developer right now, we went down that path and figured out that it&#8217;s actually not the game developers who are the worst. It&#8217;s the middlemen. It&#8217;s the way that you have to spend money on ads. Now, what&#8217;s possible with blockchain games is that you can go to market directly to the consumer by dropping tokens, which is why Axie Infinity has been able to get so many users in such a short period of time. We went from 36,000 to now 2.5 million by the end of last year. By reducing the barriers even more, people are able to play for free but still experience the magic that&#8217;s surrounding Axie. That&#8217;s what it’ll take to get to those numbers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I represent how players are now engaging with gaming guilds, so I’ll talk about that. We started YGG on top of the Axie community. The community figured out that you could actually lend NFTs to other people without giving wallet access away, basically, by this kind of two-login system. If I gave you access to a username and password, without giving you access to my blockchain wallet, you could play the game, experience the game, and earn value without having to trust the person with your assets. So, we did that starting 2020 and now this has really blown up with Axie Infinity in the Philippines and other parts of the world. We are kind of set up as a player community, or run as a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) that is now purchasing assets of different kinds of games. We&#8217;ve bought assets in over 40 games now. Whether it&#8217;s a card game, or strategy, or RPG, we now have the assets for players to come in and enjoy these games, and earn it without having to buy an NFT to start. Of course, if they like it a lot, then they might buy something afterwards.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re seeing now that YGG has grown tremendously, a lot of it in developing areas such as Southeast Asia, India, Latin America, where people are playing these games and earning supplemental income. But I think we&#8217;re going to see an evolution similar to a World of Warcraft guild with a bank account. The guild itself may buy a castle or a kingdom, and it will produce buildings. And people will come in and harvest resources. The competitive people will be fighters that will be doing PvP against other people. So, having that kind of guild layer on top of digital assets gives you new gameplay primitives to play with that you&#8217;ve never seen before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Gabby, on the topic of DAOs, maybe just one contentious question… have DAOs today basically become web3 game publishers? If you&#8217;re working on a new Web3 game, you want YGG to take a look at the token design, to go through the game design docs and sign off on it. And that way, your community, your scholars and scholarship managers, will all know that this is a legitimate project and they should put their time and money behind it. Do you think there is a world where DAOs actually become too powerful in that perspective? Because they&#8217;ve actually become gatekeepers to future Web3 games and dApps in general, even outside of games. How do you think about that as you&#8217;re structuring your company and growing?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a really good question. I think the way to win and create value in Web3 is very different from how it was before. Before, if you had something proprietary, you wanted to gate it and charge for it, which is why Facebook and Google grew really big on top of their algorithms. In Web3, the way you grow is by compounding network effects, which means that if YGG comes in and helps a game launch, helps with a token design, and buys assets, we&#8217;re not going to gatekeep and not let other guilds in. We&#8217;re actually setting the design so that hundreds of other guilds can come in, enjoy the game, and have a thriving economy. We actually reduce the network effect, and therefore the value of what we&#8217;re doing, by gatekeeping.

So, truth be told, NFTs are primitives that can be used as building blocks.t. The experiences are unlimited, if you do it right. But you need to start somewhere, so I would say start from the fundamentals and go from there.

Community has always been valuable in games, right? But in Web3, they can actually make or break your game. So, join a DAO, join the community, join a guild, and vote on some proposals. Or experience the game from the perspective of a DAO, which really gives you an idea of how powerful the network effects are of having digital assets that are owned by your player community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thank you, everyone, for joining us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FGDC-Event-1.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-310766\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FGDC-Event-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"665\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

After playing with the code a bit, I sent Satoshi a lot of questions and we had a long series of discussions where I asked him all kinds of really basic things.

I just thought it was cool and played around with it.

So I met up with someone at a bar in Zurich to buy some more, but there were no smartphone wallets then, we both had to bring our laptops, connect to wi-fi; it took five or six minutes just to log onto the network. And then it took an hour for us to do the actual trade because the stuff wouldn&#8217;t even show up until it was in the blocks, and we had to wait for someone to find a block. It took forever. We had a beer while we waited.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought, “This is ridiculous. This needs to be instant.” So I set about working on that, and that was when I started contributing to the project. I started writing my own version of bitcoin because the software Satoshi wrote didn’t fit mobile and needed a totally different approach; smartphones weren&#8217;t powerful enough to run it. Satoshi had thought about this problem and described it in his whitepaper, but didn’t have time to write it himself before he vanished. So I worked on it.

Those people would have just invented a way to send cash over the internet and left it at that. Instead of doing that, Satoshi thought, “What else can I add? Now what else can I add?

You could buy socks with bitcoin.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea16z: What ever happened to the bitcoins you’d gotten from Satoshi? \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike: I had lost them. So I met up with someone at a bar in Zurich to buy some more, but there were no smartphone wallets then, we both had to bring our laptops, connect to wi-fi; it took five or six minutes just to log onto the network. And then it took an hour for us to do the actual trade because the stuff wouldn&#8217;t even show up until it was in the blocks, and we had to wait for someone to find a block. It took forever. We had a beer while we waited.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought, “This is ridiculous. This needs to be instant.” So I set about working on that, and that was when I started contributing to the project. I started writing my own version of bitcoin because the software Satoshi wrote didn’t fit mobile and needed a totally different approach; smartphones weren&#8217;t powerful enough to run it. Satoshi had thought about this problem and described it in his whitepaper, but didn’t have time to write it himself before he vanished. So I worked on it. It was one of the first re-implementations of bitcoin ever done.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea16z:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003ESatoshi had already envisioned the mobile solution? \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike: Yeah, he designed all of it up front, way before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think most people would have been in a hurry to immediately say &#8220;Look what I made&#8221;. Those people would have just invented a way to send cash over the internet and left it at that. Instead of doing that, Satoshi thought, “What else can I add? Now what else can I add? How can I make this thing more powerful beyond what’s right in front of me?”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy mind was blown away by how big, how far in advance Satoshi was thinking… I kept encountering things in the code that were just there, without any explanation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea16z:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EOne of those things you encountered was smart contracts &#8212; which computer scientist Nick Szabo \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fszabo.best.vwh.net\u002Fidea.html\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efirst wrote about\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E in 1997 &#8212; where contractual clauses (including for physical property rights) can be facilitated through computing.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EHow did you come across that for bitcoin?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike: As I asked Satoshi more and more questions about what some of the unexplained things in the scripting language were for, he’d respond back and say oh, that’s for “contracts”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, this was around the time he was starting to step back. He stopped answering my questions and then, he just vanished&#8230; By that point we at least had a pretty clear idea of what all these smart contracts features were, even if we didn’t know exactly how he had intended them to be used. There are just a lot of things that can be done on top of bitcoin that people don’t know and many of the uses will surprise us. We won’t know until they’re built.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea16z: You never heard from Satoshi again?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike: He continued emailing with me and Gavin [Andresen, Chief Scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation to whom Nakamoto handed over the network alert key] for a few months after he stopped posting publicly. But eventually he disappeared for everyone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea16z:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EA strong open source project doesn’t need its creator though &#8212; it’s about the benefits, not about the cult of personality. Or is it? How would you contrast bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto to, say, Linux, where the chief architect of the kernel (Linus Torvalds) was also the project coordinator? Both bitcoin and Linux also have non-profit foundations behind them to help foster growth and technical collaboration. \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike: A lot of the software (a lot, not all of it) in the bitcoin space is open source. I think the open source aspects of bitcoin and Linux are pretty similar in many ways: people are sharing source code and working together, volunteering their time and skills, developing ideas over the internet, building on each other’s applications without central organization or traditional top-down management.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Bitcoin Foundation, it was actually created pretty early on. We knew this approach had worked for Linux and other open source projects, and a lot of the people who work on bitcoin (not just me, others too) had gotten their initial open source experience in the Linux communities. So how we do &#8212; or don’t &#8212; organize ourselves owes a big debt to the Linux project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea16z: I know you worked on desktop Linux (which was a flashpoint for a lot of heated discussions before!); any lessons learned for bitcoin from that experience?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike: People \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C\u002Fem\u003E don’t like it when I compare experiences and say stuff like, &#8220;Well, desktop Linux wasn&#8217;t successful because of SO-and-SO reason, we need to avoid that for bitcoin.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I was profoundly affected by that experience! I put a lot of work into desktop Linux, as did many other people. And in the end it sunk into the sand to the point where most people \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.techrepublic.com\u002Farticle\u002Fcan-we-please-stop-talking-about-the-linux-desktop\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Edon&#8217;t \u003C\u002Fa\u003Ereally think about it anymore. So when I began working on bitcoin, I did a lot of soul searching before ramping up my involvement. The difference was that this time I was in a position to help influence things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea16z: But what were some of those ‘reasons’? Any lessons can we draw for bitcoin, or open source in general? \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike: I think the main mistake people can make is losing sight of \u003Cem\u003Ewhat’s the point of it all?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E  So the open-source-ness and the free-ness of the software become the end instead of a means to an end.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis leads to ideological decisions that aren’t really based in any kind of engineering or market reality. It leads to building software that doesn’t work as well, but “we&#8217;re going to do it anyway because it&#8217;s more free or more open source that way&#8221;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s why the \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fblog.bitcoinfoundation.org\u002Fblocksize-economics\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eblocksize\u003C\u002Fa\u003E topic, which I discussed with Chris [Dixon, on the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2015\u002F07\u002F13\u002Fa16z-podcast-bitcoins-growing-pains-and-possibilities\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Ea16z Podcast\u003C\u002Fa\u003E] can lead to such vitriolic debates. Forks are not the best way to resolve these disputes, but it may happen anyway because some of the people who have become involved in the years since Satoshi left feel like the decentralization aspect of bitcoin is the end and not a \u003Cem\u003Emeans \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eto an end. Saying &#8220;You should use bitcoin because it&#8217;s decentralized,&#8221; is like saying, &#8220;You should use Linux because it&#8217;s open source.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t mean anything to people.

What made bitcoin different? What \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C\u002Fem\u003E people do with it? Is it really that easy for developers to just get started?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike: I think the fact that you can just sit down and start writing programs that work with money is simultaneously the most powerful and the most terrifying thing about bitcoin. So it&#8217;s certainly worth doing right. But unlike the banking system &#8212; which is more about social engineering, where you have to spend a lot of time talking to people and making the right contacts before you can do anything &#8212; with bitcoin, you don&#8217;t have to convince anyone of your awesomeness. You can just get started and let the awesomeness show itself. It’s the exact opposite of the way the banking system is set up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI always read about some really awesome thing that someone has created with bitcoin and that they threw together over a weekend. At DevCore in London I gave \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FHl7WT7mmS6U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Ea tutorial\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhere I made a simple Lighthouse-style app for document time-stamping in just 30 minutes. So it doesn’t have to be hard, or time-consuming. That’s such a contrast to my previous experiences, where you didn’t have that kind of flexibility or impact on payment systems even with all these huge resources behind you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea16z: What would you love to see more developers work on? I’m sure there’s a long list, but what comes quickly top of mind for you? \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMike: \u003Cstrong\u003ENetwork robustness\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is a big one.

Right now we have maybe 30-50 competing wallets, which is great for decentralization, but most of them are pretty basic. Do we really need so many?
