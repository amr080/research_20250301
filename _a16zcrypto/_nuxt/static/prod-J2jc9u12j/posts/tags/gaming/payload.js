I looked at getting a regular RV here in the states but felt they were too big, bulky, and not very well designed (lots of wasted space). Sprinter vans were the alternative solution since they are much more compact, but with Van Life trending, they were around $50k-100k+ for a used one. So I fell down the YouTube rabbit hole one day and learned about these right hand drive mini campervans from Japan and fell in love with them. The size, design, practicality, functionality, and overall uniqueness all amazed me. The goal is to use this thing to explore national parks and spontaneous road trips. I really think life design is underrated. We spend so much of our time working and chasing the next accolade, I think we should be diverting some of that time and energy into actually enjoying life with loved ones.

class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\"\u003EForte cofounder and CEO Josh Williams does a deep dive on “Opportunities for Crypto and Gaming.” Williams explains that blockchain technology could have an even bigger impact on gaming than the internet because it&#8217;s not just connecting people, but potentially changing business models by aligning the incentives of developers and players. It can do this by allowing players to truly own the assets in games and verify their provenance, and by enabling developers to code rich incentive systems and rewards into games. By incorporating these mechanisms, Williams believes, an already exploding gaming industry will grow and create multi-billion-dollar marketplaces within games that will truly benefit players and developers. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Josh Williams: Opportunities for Crypto in Gaming\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002F33Coc4jUKdQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\"\u003EAndreessen Horowitz’s Crypto Startup School brought together 45 participants from around the U.S. and overseas in a seven-week course to learn how to build crypto companies.

Narula’s main argument about the metaverse is one that Morningstar and Farmer would likely agree with: The metaverse, regardless of who builds it, how users access it, or the underlying infrastructure that supports it, should be designed to facilitate robust forms of user interaction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as importantly (though not addressed by Morningstar and Farmer), is the idea that items and experiences across the different virtual worlds that grow to exist should be able to interoperate with one another. In Narula’s words:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“A metaverse is a collection of realities which include the real world or a &#8216;home reality&#8217; and a series of other worlds that a society imbues with meaning. Events, objects, and identities can exist in and be modified by multiple worlds in the metaverse. The utility of a metaverse lies in its ability to facilitate meaningful fulfilling experiences in its constituent worlds.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany arguments about the metaverse have hinged on what it looks like: Should it be 2D or 3D? Should it be accessed immersively in VR and AR, or is desktop and mobile an appropriate platform?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe focus on aesthetics is actually a debate about standards. “What should it look like” is shorthand for “what should developers expect?” How do you reconcile between JSON and XML data types? If you’re designing for 3D, what’s the minimum number of polygons your asset should be composed of? Should avatars be available as glTF, USD, VRM, or some other file format? Should an experience happening on a Unity client be able to interoperate with a game on an Unreal Engine client? What happens when you introduce NFTs into the mix (or if you’re Microsoft, what happens when you \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.minecraft.net\u002Fen-us\u002Farticle\u002Fminecraft-and-nfts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emake a unilateral decision to ban them\u003C\u002Fa\u003E completely from Minecraft with seemingly no warning)?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think these questions are tremendously valuable, in that they signal an attitude of openness toward interoperability that’s crucial for any future version of the metaverse. But it also seems like the aesthetic and technical considerations are conflated, perhaps at the expense of economic or political considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the words of Narula, “These other worlds aren’t alternative realities into which we choose to escape: They are more reality.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you facilitate “more reality”?

As Narula puts it: “The mirror world helps catalyze conservationists’ efforts in the real world.” What Narula argues in the first few chapters of \u003Cem\u003EVirtual Society \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eis that early metaverses had a sense of reciprocity between the “imagined” world and the real one. If you extend that notion to the present day, then we should have a similar ideal: whatever form the metaverse takes, there should be a sense of permeability between the virtual world and our physical one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen something happens in the metaverse, you should feel its resonance in the physical world, and vice-versa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENarula spends a lot of time in \u003Cem\u003EVirtual Society\u003C\u002Fem\u003E explaining how he defines meaningful interaction in the metaverse, and the technological innovations achieved by Improbable to enable it for users. For Narula, meaning might be measured in “ops per second”:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;how many separate and simultaneous things can happen in a virtual environment, by reflecting how many messages are being sent or need to be sent simultaneously to model that environment. As an example, at time of writing, a game of Fortnite which allows 100 players to interact together requires roughly 10,000 communications operations per second. This statistic means that the server needs to process all of these messages, and also to quickly send them to the machines of each connected user that needs them.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis past summer, I attended a demo event in Improbable’s M² network, which the team intends to be a network of metaverses where users can connect in highly dense environments, and port in NFTs and other avatars between worlds. There were over 4500 users in attendance, all in the same server instance (in other words, no sharding!), speaking and interacting with one another. Over time, M² intends to grow to support not just the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fotherside.xyz\u002Flitepaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EOtherside metaverse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, but other creative endeavors as well: concerts with musicians, spaces for communities, events with artists and creators.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn many ways, the challenges M² aims to address &#8212; how to get a bunch of disparate users to agree on a shared notion of temporality &#8212; is also a core challenge that blockchains solve for. And in many ways, we’re also beginning to see blockchains, and the applications built on top of them, begin to solve other problems that have frustrated the internet and early attempts at the metaverse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne way to think of a blockchain is as a game-like social network with an infinitely customizable frontend. Using Ethereum as an example: You have a public key as a form of login; opt-in identities tied to that public key (e.g. ENS, Farcaster); an inventory (NFTs, ERC20 tokens); applications accessible through your public key (e.g. Uniswap, NFT exchanges, on-chain games); and a shared notion of history (viewable on Etherscan or parseable on an Ethereum node).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart contracts running on Ethereum are open-source &#8212; meaning that users can audit them for safety, and just as importantly, modify them via forking. These modifications may extend the underlying codebase (e.g., a composable application that interacts with the smart contract, a new client or frontend built for the smart contract, or a derivative project based on the initial protocol). The more a smart contract is interacted with and extended, the more valuable it can become.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of the most interesting experiments in Ethereum today have been in fields that mix artistic, social, economic, political, and gameplay-like elements.

The effort to develop alternative clients for NounsDAO is a testament to the notion that a protocol should be resilient, and offer users a breadth of choices for how they access it.

There were over 4500 users in attendance, all in the same server instance (in other words, no sharding!), speaking and interacting with one another. Over time, M² intends to grow to support not just the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fotherside.xyz\u002Flitepaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EOtherside metaverse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, but other creative endeavors as well: concerts with musicians, spaces for communities, events with artists and creators.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn many ways, the challenges M² aims to address &#8212; how to get a bunch of disparate users to agree on a shared notion of temporality &#8212; is also a core challenge that blockchains solve for. And in many ways, we’re also beginning to see blockchains, and the applications built on top of them, begin to solve other problems that have frustrated the internet and early attempts at the metaverse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne way to think of a blockchain is as a game-like social network with an infinitely customizable frontend. Using Ethereum as an example: You have a public key as a form of login; opt-in identities tied to that public key (e.g. ENS, Farcaster); an inventory (NFTs, ERC20 tokens); applications accessible through your public key (e.g. Uniswap, NFT exchanges, on-chain games); and a shared notion of history (viewable on Etherscan or parseable on an Ethereum node).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart contracts running on Ethereum are open-source &#8212; meaning that users can audit them for safety, and just as importantly, modify them via forking. These modifications may extend the underlying codebase (e.g., a composable application that interacts with the smart contract, a new client or frontend built for the smart contract, or a derivative project based on the initial protocol). The more a smart contract is interacted with and extended, the more valuable it can become.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of the most interesting experiments in Ethereum today have been in fields that mix artistic, social, economic, political, and gameplay-like elements. A good example here is \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnouns.wtf\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ENounsDAO\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which launched in the summer of last year. In brief, NounsDAO is an NFT project in which a daily auction is held for the sale of a Noun NFT, and proceeds of the sale go to a treasury shared by holders of the Nouns, who can \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnouns.wtf\u002Fvote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Evote on proposals\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for how the treasury is spent. Crucially, the auction protocol, the art, and the governance is all conducted entirely on-chain. Proposals funded by the DAO have proliferated the Nouns meme and ethos across the internet and the physical world &#8212; thanks primarily to the way the project has captivated the imagination of artists and developers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2232 size-large\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F10\u002Fnounsdao_github-1024x512-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Ethereum, we’ve seen projects like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnouns.wtf\u002Fvote\u002F2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ea 3D Nouns generator\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, derivative auctions and projects funded through \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fprop.house\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EProphouse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (which was infrastructure \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnouns.wtf\u002Fvote\u002F105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efunded with\u003C\u002Fa\u003E the Nouns treasury, but has now grown to support other NFT projects), and an effort to support multiple developers \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnouns.wtf\u002Fvote\u002F103\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebuilding alternative clients\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for Nouns.

The effort to develop alternative clients for NounsDAO is a testament to the notion that a protocol should be resilient, and offer users a breadth of choices for how they access it. The success of the NFT project itself is just one example of the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fcc0-nft-creative-commons-zero-license-rights\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eprevalence of cc0 NFT collections\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in general &#8212; that an image in the metaverse should be freely forked, mutated, and be enjoyed by anyone who desires to use it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the project, cryptonetworks, and the metaverse itself are still in early forms, I think NounsDAO represents a compelling example of what elements of the metaverse one day might look like: a robust ecosystem around a core ethos or culture, that persists across both the digital and physical worlds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA big irony I’ve noticed in the corporate-motivated efforts behind the metaverse is that these teams are often building for massive brands that predated the internet. It feels like an effort to rebuild digital society as if the social ruptures and micro-cultures manifested by the internet never happened (a pretty futile act in my opinion). One thing Narula hints at &#8212; that I don’t see a lot of people talking about &#8212; is that those most inclined to build on metaverse platforms (be it Ethereum, other blockchains, or platforms that prioritize interoperable experiences) will likely be internet-native communities and creators, with treasuries that they want to preserve for developing their own culture. In Narula’s words:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;In order for a metaverse to populate with the quantity and quality of worlds and experiences necessary for it to be worth anyone’s time, then, it will have to resemble an inverted pyramid, where the infrastructure providers take the smallest percentage of value, and the rest of the value is created by and accrues to the creators.&#8221;\u003Cem\u003E \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized blockchains eliminate middlemen. We live in an era of 30% app store take rates, opaque algorithms, and where an increasingly high volume of content competes for an ever-dividing audience for attention.

It&#8217;s very much allowing the experience to periodically evolve &#8212; sometimes through the user interactions, and sometimes through new discoveries. So: puzzling and problem-solving is like formulating a- an incentive design; it often has the same mixture of elegance and precision &#8212; figuring out how to make a crypto design actually work together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally agree. And puzzle design is not just about designing the medium, it&#8217;s about designing the full experience &lt;Scott: yes&gt;. So when you&#8217;re designing a puzzle, it&#8217;s not just &#8220;I made a crossword, here, solve it&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s everything contextually around how that puzzle is presented &#8212; because the puzzle is the experience that the solver has.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is often overlooked in puzzle contests in any format &#8212; where incentivization structure, the prize structure is part of the puzzle, whether you like it or not. Like in an escape room also: The fact that there is a time limit, is part of the puzzle; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; it&#8217;s not separate from the puzzles. That totally dictates how you engage with the puzzles, whether you&#8217;re taking your time; whether you&#8217;re solving as quickly as possible just to get to the answer and then moving on; or fully solving and appreciating each of the intermediate a-ha’s of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me: A big part of the style of puzzle design I do and enjoy solving is about puzzles as a type of personal expression, and encouraging &lt;Scott: yah&gt; research rabbit-holes, and sharing deep areas of knowledge and hobbies and identities and such &lt;Sonal: yess!&gt; So like I have a background as a software engineer; I&#8217;m also a violinist, I do some visual art stuff; when I design puzzles, it brings in all of these different perspectives. And the a-ha moments I create in puzzles are- whether from existing hobbies or new areas of research rabbit holes that I enjoy leading people down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in particular I think this contrasts with how people often view a specific type of puzzle-solving as influenced by &#8212; the Times crossword specifically; it’s &#8212; you can&#8217;t look things up; It&#8217;s how much you know already &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; If there&#8217;s a way to figure it out, if there&#8217;s a way to sort of piece stuff together, there certainly is more puzzle-y trivia… but trivia on its own isn&#8217;t necessarily a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don&#8217;t necessarily view trivia (in and of itself) as a type of puzzle-solving, simply because it&#8217;s you-know-it-or-you-don&#8217;t. If anything it&#8217;s the exact opposite: I&#8217;m designing the puzzle around getting you to look things up and then keep going deeper, and be four hours into researching &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; asteroid-naming conventions, and suddenly you have this discovery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly; discover this entirely new world that the puzzle introduced you to. And hilariously, this is how I got into NFTs, originally… &lt;Sonal: Oh! Say more!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, for a couple of years (so starting early in the pandemic), Bloomberg had me write a mostly-weekly \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Fstorythreads\u002F2021-03-21\u002Fkominers-s-conundrums-a-treasure-trove-of-puzzles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle column\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. And… you know we tied the columns, when we could, to things that were in the news that were kind of puzzle-y, and potentially of interest to Bloomberg readers. And crypto is of course highly of interest to Bloomberg readers, and so we actually did two puzzles around NFTs:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne right after the Beeple sale &#8212; NFTs feel really puzzle-y, right; like &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; you&#8217;ve got this art that&#8217;s in the open, but it&#8217;s cryptographically secured; and there&#8217;s a bunch of puzzles that are about solving different sorts of codes, or cryptosystems. And so I did a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fopinion\u002Farticles\u002F2021-02-28\u002Fkominers-s-conundrums-the-most-cryptic-piece-of-art-in-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle\u003C\u002Fa\u003E &#8211;the story was: This new art is in the open; but the address is hidden, can you locate it? (It was one of the best puzzles we ran in the entire series I think, got lots of solvers, lots of attention.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you know a couple months later, these profile-picture projects &#8212; I know PFP doesn&#8217;t stand for profile picture project, but hey &lt;Sonal laughs&gt; it matches the acronym &#8212; you know these PFPs really became popular. And around the time I was reading a New Yorker article about the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and I was like oh wow these feel really puzzle-y too. And I went to my editor I was like &#8220;Look can we do a second one on NFTs around these \u003Cem\u003Echaracters\u003C\u002Fem\u003E; like everyone&#8217;s playing these characters.” And he sort of said &#8220;Our readers are interested in crypto; if you think there&#8217;s a puzzle here!&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I did a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fopinion\u002Farticles\u002F2021-08-08\u002Fkominers-s-conundrums-how-much-is-that-avatar-in-the-window\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esecond one\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that was built around the PFPs: The imagined setup was you had all of these new NFTs had been released &#8212; that we, Bloomberg Conundrums (the puzzle group) &lt;Soal: mhm&gt; had been collecting them surreptitiously for months &#8212; and now we&#8217;d hidden them but you needed to figure out again something about decoding and understanding the addresses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I mentioned in that column &#8212; I referenced the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks and SupDucks &#8212; and then the SupDucks community reached out and said, &#8220;Look, I think you would like this; why don&#8217;t you join our discord and check it out?&#8221; SupDucks is a 10000-PFP collection from the mind of FrankyNines, based on an earlier NFT he&#8217;d created called “Sup Duck” and a related one called “King Frog” &#8212; I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s a series of ducks… &#8212; it&#8217;s a great group of people who boost and cheer each other up by saying &#8220;’sup&#8221; a lot… And then there&#8217;s, you know-\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &lt;laughs&gt; &#8216;sup, Scott?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly. &#8216;sup?! And no seriously, I mean like the process of getting your first NFT is very complicated &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;, one of my friends who was already really deep in crypto (Far!) helped me navigate\u003Csup\u003E84\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E this &#8212; but when I got my first duck, I had hundreds of people within like minutes posted like “&#8217;sup”, “&#8217;sup”, “&#8217;sup” with their ducks… &#8212; it was totally magical. (A lot of other NFT projects have emerged out of this initial community.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… that was my first entry into an NFT community: I&#8217;d written this puzzle about NFTs, that appealed enough to the NFT community, and that they could sort of tell that I you know, had the personality type that would find this stuff fun. And so I joined the SupDucks pond and I haven&#8217;t looked back.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPuzzling is like a metaphor for crypto &#8212; but the other thing is that lots of crypto people like puzzles. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; And like we&#8217;ve been doing puzzle with a variety of different crypto projects; it fits in with their experience of game design and stuff like that. We&#8217;ve built it with projects, community engagement activities; sometimes collaborative puzzles, sometimes competitive ones… There&#8217;s some Bored Ape community-run hunt going on right now… There&#8217;s sort of a lot of puzzling in the NFT communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have an \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fsignals.mysteryleague.com\u002Fpilcrow-bar\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Earticle\u003C\u002Fa\u003E about the Pilcrow Bar puzzle hunt, and, it was a six-week-long puzzle hunt that a collaborator Sandy Weisz, and I designed for Alinea (this Michelin-star restaurant in Chicago, early pandemic, like June 2020). And it started off easy to moderate difficulty and got into like three to four-hour-long puzzle solves by the end.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what was exciting about the project was: It was a group of many thousands of people, solving really deep puzzle-hunt puzzles &#8212; who hadn&#8217;t really heard of or solved puzzle hunts before. So, for me it was really… sort of proof of concept of just how many people there are out there, who would really deeply enjoy this medium of puzzle-solving &#8212; that goes much deeper than the like 30-second puzzles you see on social media, or even like the 2- to 5-minute type puzzles that you see in escape rooms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, is much more uniquely architected than like The New York Times crossword &#8212; to find friends, family, significant others; strangers on the internet even &#8212; to solve these puzzles with, and it formed so many incredible connections, and micro sub-communities and things, of people working on solving these puzzles together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the record: I wanna state that using standard crosswords and sudokus as examples of what we don&#8217;t do, we don&#8217;t mean to be shitting on those puzzles &#8212; I write crosswords also. I love standard crosswords; I love cryptic crosswords quite a bit more &#8212; It&#8217;s… more that those are fun, somewhat more static, mediums.

And then we can dig into more of the specifics of puzzle-hunt mediums, design philosophies, incentive design mindsets… let’s actually talk more now about the categories, of puzzle types.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, absolutely.

So there are puzzle boxes…\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThere are sequential discovery puzzles, where you discover items along the way that serve as tools helping you with later steps.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDisentanglement puzzles; packing puzzles where you&#8217;re fitting pieces together into some form.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen we have sort of types of puzzle \u003Cem\u003Epresentations\u003C\u002Fem\u003E:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPuzzle hunts, which are sort of puzzle games where each puzzle solves to a word or phrase as an answer.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAnd then there are metapuzzles that use the answers to each of those feeder puzzles, altogether.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThen there are sort of sandboxed, immersive puzzle experiences &#8212; which is a fancy way of saying escape rooms, typically.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, escape rooms: I describe escape rooms as typically in-person &#8212; there&#8217;s been quite the renaissance of virtual escape room options also &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; &#8212; but, escape rooms are essentially a form of immersive in-person gaming. Where typically you&#8217;re in a self-contained environment versus treasure hunting, ARGs etc., are more broadly just site-specific gaming out in the real world (instead of contained in a controlled space). But, escape rooms are so much more than escaping or even just about rooms these days: They&#8217;re really incredible types of immersive gaming experiences that are typically puzzle-driven.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Sorry what does A-R-G stand for again?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Alternate reality game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh okay; keep going, yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Then we also have types of pervasive puzzle experiences &#8212; pulling from the great book “Pervasive Games” which uses that term to describe games that exist out in the real world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, this takes a few different forms most notably, alternate reality games: Which are sort of narrative-driven (often times also puzzle-driven games), juxtaposed on the real world &#8212; where anything and everything in the world can be part of a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere also are more contained, but also site-specific, types of puzzling: this includes treasure hunts, letterboxing, geocaching &#8212; various types of engagement with in-person sites, where you’re solving puzzles out in the real world &#8212; urban treasure hunts as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDid I miss anything Scott?

Now that we have a high-level lay of the land of puzzle types, I’d love go even deeper into the puzzle mediums – or, I guess what you just called Matthew the “puzzle presentation” aspect &#8212; especially when it comes to puzzle hunts (which you both won and mentioned a lot!)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Certainly! So, it&#8217;s sort of hard to describe as one thing, but they have a few general properties &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETypically, each puzzle solves to a word or phrase as a final answer. So in contrast to maybe a New York Times crossword, where a correctly filled in grid is the answer to the puzzle; in a puzzle hunt, if you had a crossword, it would go one step further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And that might be reading every square that has a prime number in it or something. &lt;Sonal: Got it&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;d be a clue that led you to realize, the prime numbers mattered or something.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly. Which gets to… In a crossword, you sort of know what you&#8217;re doing when you&#8217;re presented with a puzzle: You know that you have some clues, and you need to answer the clues, and fill them into a grid.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a puzzle hunt, oftentimes the puzzle is figuring out what to do: You&#8217;re presented with some information, some piece of data, some object. And, puzzle-hunt puzzles will oftentimes have (what&#8217;s called) “flavor text” accompanying them, which gives some keywords\u003Csup\u003E18\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E that you need to pay special attention to, keying in on what might be going on in the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut typically it requires: pattern observation, paying attention to small details, noticing what might be amiss, applying common techniques. You have some clues, figure out what the answers might be. Maybe some of the clues are a little bit too ambiguous to figure out the answer at first, but you fill in the ones that you know for sure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then maybe you notice that &#8212; this is just gonna be an example of a very generic, simple puzzle-hunt style puzzle &#8212; maybe you noticed that the left column of the answers, the answers are in alphabetical order; but the right column, the answers seem to be in some particular order. And then you notice that the left column maybe, are anagrams of one of the answers in the right column plus a letter. That type of wordplay is called a “transaddition”. So you match one from the left column, one to the right column; since the left column (the alphabetized ones), already has a strict ordering, you know that probably the ordering of the right column answers matters. And then maybe the extra letters spell out a clue phrase, which then clues some final word is the final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat might be the flow for &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; a really generic style of this puzzle. &lt;Sonal: Got it&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, there are things to figure out along the way; you don&#8217;t necessarily know what the later steps are &#8212; but there are layers that reveal themselves as you progress through the puzzle. And somehow you can get a final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother property\u003Csup\u003E46\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E of puzzle hunts is “metapuzzles”. At the end of the round, you metapuzzle &#8212; which, in some way uses the answers to all the individual puzzles in that round &#8212; which are called the “feeder” puzzle answers. Again this can take so so many different forms; &lt;Sonal: yah!&gt; I&#8217;m not even going to try and get into examples of that now…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are sort of two categories of metapuzzles: “shell” metapuzzles or “shell-less” metapuzzles. Shell metapuzzles means that you&#8217;re presented with some extra information for the metapuzzle. Whereas shell-less means that the metapuzzle is elegantly contained just within the answers themselves. One is not necessarily better than the other, but, it certainly can be a level more elegant if you can make a shell-less metapuzzle &#8212; where there&#8217;s that extra layer of hidden meaning contained within the answers staring you in the face the entire time. That then once you&#8217;ve solved all of these individual puzzles (that individually are cohesive satisfying experiences), you then reveal another entirely new layer of meaning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, the structure can continue on from there; there can be meta metapuzzles that combine all the metapuzzles. Metapuzzle structures can get really creative: So, they can use more than just even the answers to the feeder puzzles. They can also use some version of the mechanics to the feeder puzzles. They can use answers to feeder puzzles from previous rounds, sort of a waterfall\u002F cascade structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favorite MIT Mystery Hunt puzzle rounds &#8212; the world&#8217;s biggest annual puzzle hunt which happens at MIT annually in January; it involves thousands of participants, hundreds of puzzles; it&#8217;s all-out battle-royale of puzzles, with pulling out all the stops in terms of difficulty and depth and such &#8212; one of my all-time favorite metapuzzle structures I&#8217;ve seen was in the 2020 Mystery Hunt designed by Galactic Trendsetters.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The official team name is like &#8220;Whoosh, Galactic Trendsetters, screeeee…&#8221; right, there you go. &lt;Matthew: Yes, that one&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Nice sound effects, Scott! &lt;Scott: thank you&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The sound effects are part of their name &lt;Sonal: I love it (laughs)&gt;; I mispronounced it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut they had this one round, the nano round &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if you remember this Scott~\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E ~Oh god yah that was epic~\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E ~Yah; Where normally, you have a bunch of feeder puzzles, and then there&#8217;s a metapuzzle at the end. In this round, you were presented with the answer to the metapuzzle at the start &#8212; and then a bunch of feeder puzzles &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EExcept one of the constituent feeder puzzles wasn&#8217;t solvable, on its own, and you had to realize that it was a reverse metapuzzle structure: So you actually had to backsolve that feeder puzzle answer, from knowing the meta answer to the round and solving all the other puzzles to that round. “Backsolve” basically means once you know the answer to a metapuzzle, by the constraints of the meta, and by maybe some of the constraints of an individual puzzle, you can actually figure out the answer to a feeder puzzle without actually forward-solving it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ah, fascinating.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, that&#8217;s backsolving, and then constrasting &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; “partial-solving” means solving a puzzle without fully solving it. So say there&#8217;s a puzzle that has 30 lines of data, and I&#8217;m getting a letter from each line; if I have two-thirds of those letters, I can probably figure out what the words it’s spelling out are. And without fully solving the puzzle, I can still figure out what the missing letters are and arrive at the final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut anyhow: You backsolve this one answer, and then solving that puzzle unlocked a sub-round for which that puzzle was the meta. And then it recursively continued forward for I think three layers or so? I&#8217;m getting pretty deep pretty quickly in this sort of&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Keep going, we like the deep; go ahead.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah. But I think a bigger theme that I&#8217;m getting at here is &#8212; puzzle design has to be for a specific audience. A puzzle is not a good puzzle generally, it&#8217;s a good puzzle relative to who it&#8217;s designed to be solved by.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if I&#8217;m designing a puzzle for team-building activity for a tech company, for a bunch of software engineers, I know I can rely on a certain type of analytical thinking and communication skills, but not on knowledge of puzzle conventions. &lt;Sonal: Right&gt; But I will know that software engineers intuitively will know what puzzle indexing is, because indexing is a key concept in programming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVersus if I&#8217;m designing a puzzle hunt for an audience of puzzle hunters, &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; I can&#8217;t just design generic\u003Csup\u003E97\u003C\u002Fsup\u003Epuzzles and expect them to be interesting and thought-provoking &#8212; because those people will know all the conventions; they&#8217;ll know what to expect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, when I&#8217;m designing for that sort of audience, I&#8217;m intending to subvert their expectations relative to how they would expect the puzzles to unfold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, if I&#8217;m designing a music puzzle for an audience of musicians, I can design a-ha moments, I can design shifts in perception around getting those musicians to maybe see conventions of musical notation, or manipulate audio files in a way that is novel to them. Versus if I&#8217;m designing a music puzzle for an audience of non-musicians, I may pick something that&#8217;s a special property of music that myself as a musician, something that I want to share with those people… Some a-ha I&#8217;ve had about music; and I&#8217;ll use the structure of the puzzle to get the solvers to experience that moment on their own.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Teach!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPuzzles have this really special property &#8212; in contrast to other types of game and interaction design &#8212; where you&#8217;re not telling people what to do; you&#8217;re providing them with some materials, some experiential framing that leads them to figure out what to do on their own. And, when done properly, it sets them up for these really powerful moments of revelation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So to pick on this education note for a moment &#8212; Scott just said, it’s like teaching &#8212; and I came from the world of developmental psychology (that was my grad work); and one of the things that was very much in vogue was you know this idea of constructivism and how students learn. It was an NSF grant, National Science Foundation grant that I was on about early numeracy in preschoolers; and it was how you harness children&#8217;s natural numeracy and skills, before they even have any formal systems for learning math.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, what was super fascinating about it is the philosophy of this Russian cognitive psychologist &#8212; Vygotsky, who wrote a book called \u003Cem\u003EMind in Society\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; and one of the key concepts that comes up is this idea of “scaffolding”… as a way to set up the learning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the ideal teacher essentially &#8212; in this context (and this applies in Montessori, Reggio Emilia, lots of school practices) &#8212; they essentially set up a scaffolding in the environment, that this child or student or person then explores, to construct their own learning. And that&#8217;s literally just kinda like what you just said and how &lt;Scott: One hundred percent&gt; it maps to puzzle design. And it&#8217;s like what you said Scott about education, it&#8217;s like teaching.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s exactly it; and we should both talk about the sort of philosophies of puzzle design. But for me, this scaffolding component is absolutely central &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want people to be able to make discoveries right; you want a discovery to feel like an accomplishment and a major a-ha… But you also want to sort of enable them to make constant forward progress in some sense, right. Like it&#8217;s okay to get stuck sometimes or it&#8217;s okay to you know be thinking like where is this puzzle taking me &#8212; but it shouldn&#8217;t be a way\u002F in the sense that you&#8217;re stuck in that like you wanna quit.

Puzzle hunts and alternate reality games are especially intriguing because they are fertile ground for really densely layered puzzle architectures &#8212; contrasting with other types of puzzles where, you sort of know what you&#8217;re supposed to do; it&#8217;s more figuring out how to do it, than figuring out what to do, &lt;Sonal: mmm… mhm&gt; and then sort of peeling back layer upon layer.

And at that point it&#8217;s less about what you do with the data &#8212; it&#8217;s less about this specific abstraction being the puzzle &#8212; as the context in which it&#8217;s (ideally novelly) presented, being a matter of recognizing the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is the case with any sorts of ciphers: It&#8217;s deciphering something, solving a Vigenère cipher, or a pigpen cipher &#8212; it&#8217;s not about decoding that is a puzzle, it&#8217;s about recognizing the cipher; it&#8217;s about the type of environmental pattern recognition, that is the actual act of puzzling.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yup.

Solving a puzzle is about crossing a threshold of perception &#8212; It&#8217;s about seeing something one way, and then through a process of frustration, and observation, and playing around, and looking for patterns, and making discoveries… you&#8217;re led to see it a different way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you can be given that final answer; that doesn&#8217;t mean you have solved the puzzle. In the context of a competition, when something is framed as a competitive puzzle hunt and you need to call on this final answer &#8212; sure, it&#8217;s marked as solved; but solving the puzzle for me really is about experiencing that shift in perception.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah.

That it needs to be a proportionately satisfying payoff for the solver, to make them want to go through this process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you really put in the legwork, feeling like you&#8217;re making progress &#8212; not just grinding and not getting anywhere &#8212; but when you finally overcome the final hurdle, it&#8217;s all the more satisfying because of the work that you&#8217;ve put in. When that work is designed in such a way so that it does feel like it&#8217;s leading into the final answer, instead of just sort of fizzling off at the end. When done well can be this really climactic moment of revelation. &lt;Sonal: Yeah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis gets into another point, which is: A puzzle needs to be designed such that what it gates&#8211; So, gating in puzzle design or escape room design, game design generally &#8212; means, there&#8217;s something preventing you from accessing further content: So in the case of an escape room, it might be a padlock that you have to put a number into that opens a chest that has a new item you need. Or in the case of a puzzle hunt, it might be typing in your answer to a puzzle, which in turn unlocks a new round of puzzles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gating needs to be conceived such that it&#8217;s worth fully solving the puzzle, it&#8217;s worth &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; getting a satisfying experience instead of being inclined to sidestep that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, to give a simple example from a sort of escape room-type mindset: If you have a padlock on a chest, the a-ha of the puzzle aligns with the satisfaction of the lock popping open, and then you move on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, say you had four separate puzzles that each gave you one digit &#8212; in addition to it not being very satisfying to just get a digit from zero through nine from a puzzle &#8212; It also means that when you get down to that last puzzle, it&#8217;s not a matter of if I fully solve this one puzzle that has a cohesive mechanic, but rather, do I go through the process of solving this last puzzle? Or do I do what&#8217;s probably less effort of just spinning the last dial?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you&#8217;re sort of gating yourself instead of the game gating you. So, the stakes for the a-ha feel less real because you&#8217;re sort of breaking the immersion. It really has to be worth it for you to solve that last puzzle &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; if that requires more effort than the other path of just brute-forcing it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis applies to competitive framing as well: Does it make sense to fully solve the puzzle; are you borrowing the answer from a different team who you happen to hear the answer from. What types of behavior are you incentivizing? And, is the path of least resistance &#8212; is that the experience you want solvers to take? What types of behavior at each possible point throughout the experience, are you setting them up for?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So talking about incentive design and behavioral design &lt;Matthew: yah&gt;, and this, obviously maps onto crypto &#8212; given what we&#8217;ve talked about so far, taxonomy of puzzles, some of the mechanics, some of the design, some of the software analogies &#8212; how would you think about this in the context of crypto?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well first of all, it&#8217;s very similar to the intellectual challenge of designing an incentive scheme. Like how is your token going to work; what is it going to do or enable your community to do? What will happen as people start to engage with it; how will the experience evolve? Like these are all the same types of questions that you sort of formulate when you&#8217;re constructing a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike I often think of a token system as being sort of a big community puzzle environment, that&#8217;s set up by the project creators, and enabling it to evolve and build upon itself in exactly the way that like a collaborative puzzle-solving exercise works. And that means that as the designer that you have to think about all of these things that Matthew was just talking about in terms of puzzle design: You want it to drive incentives that make people excited about engaging and exploring the boundaries of what your design can do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also wanna make the thing feel intuitive &#8212; even if it&#8217;s new; right something can be novel and yet sort of be intuitive at every step of engagement &#8212; And if you&#8217;re a crypto project that&#8217;s trying to reach broad consumers, you&#8217;re facing very much the same design challenge that Matthew and I face when we write puzzles for general audiences. It turns out: you can get people in very very general audiences to solve incredibly difficult puzzles… even thinking going in that they&#8217;re not gonna be able to, if you design the architecture of the puzzle in a way that sort of leads them along, and then the unlocks start to appear, and then they gain confidence and understanding of the structure of the puzzle as they go, and it can get harder. Similarly, that&#8217;s very much how a crypto project &#8212; especially one that&#8217;s trying to reach an audience that&#8217;s not already deep in the weeds of crypto, but rather that is going to engage with it and sort of use it as an exploration and a path in…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then similarly, this point about audiences, right &#8212; the idea that the same thing will be interpreted very differently by two audiences with different experiences and different backgrounds &#8212; this crops up in crypto design all the time, too. Even just the interfaces through which we interact with crypto, right: Are you using a custodial wallet or a non-custodial wallet; are you minting on a website, or are you minting through the contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, you see you see NFT launches that are only minted through contract. And why is that? The aesthetic of what the project is trying to accomplish, they essentially want to limit to people who have the technical sophistication to access it in this way: It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re trying to be a closed community for the sake of just being insular, rather, the technical complexity of joining is helping screen for the audience that they think will actually appreciate what they&#8217;re doing. &lt;Sonal: Yeah…&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo in a puzzle hunt, often the first puzzles or the first round of puzzles are much more accessible than the others. And then if you find that the environment and the ecosystem being set up by the project is one that feels right, then you might start working really hard and be willing to like put much more effort in. And all of that pulls back to a design problem on behalf of the creator &#8212; right, if you&#8217;re creating this project, you want to enable people to dip their toe in and then discover &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; they want to swim and then you know also immerse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, that intro round really is a welcome &#8212; but it&#8217;s also about building trust in the integrity of the design. It&#8217;s also an opportunity to level the playing field just a little bit. &lt;Scott: yes&gt; So, when people are newer to puzzles, they may not be as familiar with the conventions &#8212; or even just the conventions of a particular designer or design team &#8212; and those newer puzzles are opportunities to present the atomic elements of whatever puzzle world people are being presented with. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, like in a video game where you&#8217;re maybe taught some basic mechanics, and then you&#8217;re throwing variation after variation and hybrids of those variations &#8212; similarly with puzzle mechanics, you&#8217;re introducing people to the general style and aesthetics and what they can do, what they can&#8217;t do: Are the puzzles going totally outside of the box, and expecting you to dive into the source code, and use real-world components? Are they all just contained within PDF?

They wanna get the intentionality (to Matthew&#8217;s point), that they are in a trusted place, where someone has intentionally put things together for them; &lt;yah&gt; so I think that&#8217;s a really great analogy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne quick thing: The two of you are kinda dancing in a really interesting tension between both the idea of insider access, and the idea of accessibility &lt;Scott: yes&gt; It&#8217;s almost like a bit of a paradox &#8212; Okay there&#8217;s a little signaling to your like-minded, quote-&#8220;community&#8221;, whatever it is, it could be cut across whatever level &#8212; a certain domain knowledge, a certain specialty, a certain interest; it could just be puzzles in the meta. Or, there&#8217;s also the sense of, well, how do we also make it not too insular and inaccessible to people joining? &lt;Scott: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause honestly when I hear you guys talk, it feels extremely intricate\u003Csup\u003E73\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E and internal &#8212; and frankly just to draw the analogy to crypto &#8212; that also comes up quite a bit with people feeling like they&#8217;re entering into a crypto community. So I&#8217;d love you to kinda break down how this works in the puzzle world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally; this is such a great question.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So I think this touches on a few things. One is, how to approach difficulty in puzzle design. Because difficult puzzles can be fun, but it&#8217;s a lot harder to design an easy novel elegant puzzle than it is to design a difficult puzzle. And of course it&#8217;s challenging to design a difficult puzzle that is also elegant and satisfying… But the easiest type of puzzle to design is a very very difficult puzzle that absolutely nobody can solve and nobody would have fun solving. And, we see plenty of people doing this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, one of the safeguards against this is of course, “playtesting” &#8212; where when you come up with a puzzle idea, implement it, you don&#8217;t just release it to your solvers; you show it to some playtesters first who are a curated community of people. When I&#8217;m designing a project, depending on the audience and timeline and budget, I&#8217;ll have anywhere from one or two playtesters to dozens across multiple rounds &#8212; from people playtesting sort of a stub of the initial idea, to a fully implemented draft, to final proofing the sort of post-prod, fully artified version of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I&#8217;m designing a puzzle hunt for a crypto community for instance, it&#8217;s likely that those people aren&#8217;t going to be familiar with puzzle hunts already. They aren&#8217;t going to know all of these conventions and all of the sort of in-the-weeds nuances that Scott and I are discussing here. And, to some extent they don&#8217;t have to, but to some extent we also need to meet them halfway: We need to recognize what their behaviors are going to be, what their initial perceptions are going to be, how to properly engage them and really get them excited about exploring this world in the way that we hope for them to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it&#8217;s important to playtest with a representative sampling of the type of community who is actually going to be playing the game. So, I have (for my own puzzle work) a private Discord server where I have a bunch of puzzle people who regularly playtest my puzzles, give me their feedback, make sure the actual puzzle mechanics work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then when I&#8217;m figuring out the exact framing of the puzzle, how it&#8217;s going to be presented, the flavor text, the hints that accompany the puzzle, I&#8217;m not playtesting with those people still &#8212; I&#8217;m finding some people who are of a similar demographic, similar background to the actual people who are going to be solving my hunt. And, that allows me to sort of gauge the way the puzzles are going to be received, before they&#8217;re actually out in the field. And if things go terribly wrong then, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the hunt is going to be wrong, it is going to be totally broken; &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; I can adjust accordingly in advance. &lt;Sonal: that’s great&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is similar to software development cycles as well: &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; We would never release a piece of software without unit-testing everything, and integration testing everything, and making sure that it fully works at all stages. We would never commit one final code change and be like oh it worked in the last stage &lt;Sonal: yah… totally&gt; so it probably still works; we would run all of our tests again before releasing it. And the same applies to experience design and its many forms, and especially to puzzle design, where, we are actively encouraging solvers to pay attention to every last detail to get in the mindset that anything could be part of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… in an elegant puzzle-hunt style puzzle, everything sort of is part of the puzzle. We&#8217;re not adding in random text that seems puzzle-y but actually means nothing. There&#8217;s a lot of attention paid to making sure that any actual noise in the puzzle couldn&#8217;t be interpreted as meaningful noise. &lt;Sonal: right!&gt; So that means if we expect the solvers to put a list of data in a new ordering based on some property of the data, we intentionally put the data initially in some ordering that&#8217;s clearly not the final ordering. So like I was saying previously, that can be alphabetical ordering, that can be a bullet-point list rather than a numbered list; various things to signal the type of behavior we expect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what this all translates to in terms of access to the community, is: Not that we should design easier puzzles, but rather that we should give accessible points to people and welcome them into this community. Where, by the final puzzle, the solvers are solving things that they didn&#8217;t realize they were able to &#8212; they&#8217;re presented with something that would&#8217;ve seemed utterly impenetrable at the beginning… but by the end through the way in which the game has guided them to build up their abilities they realize that yes, they&#8217;re able to do this as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this actually gets at one of the biggest differences between newer puzzlers, and people who are familiar with these styles of puzzles (or any styles of puzzles really) &#8212; which is: Simply just the willingness to try things. Oftentimes when I&#8217;m running puzzles of any level of difficulty for people who are new to puzzles, they&#8217;ll prematurely come to me or whoever is running the game, for hints. And of course, prior to telling them what to do, we&#8217;ll say, &#8220;What have you tried so far?&#8221; And oftentimes they&#8217;ll make a correct observation; they&#8217;ll describe part of the solution, and then I&#8217;ll reply &#8220;Well, did you try that?&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so many times I hear the response, &#8220;No, because I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would be correct.&#8221; And it&#8217;s that willingness to just try that really differentiates those more novice solvers from more experienced solvers who are willing to go down a rabbit hole, see if it works… and then embrace the fact that even when it doesn&#8217;t work, they perhaps learn something interesting along the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s so fascinating ‘cause earlier when you talked about the &#8220;payoff&#8221; &#8212; that was like a word that I use in editorial all the time &#8212; because a lot of people have these religious debates about how long a piece should be… &lt;Matthew: mhm&gt; and I always say length is arbitrary to me, quite frankly; it&#8217;s really about the “payoff proportional” to what you&#8217;re putting in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, editorially, when you just described that like the designer has to put in these sort of intermediate things, and things to kinda bring people along – and-and you again, reinforced this idea of trust &#8212; it made me think of a very editorial concept that I use all the time when it comes to religious debates between quote-&#8220;dumbing things down&#8221; or not (‘cause a lot of people say, oh technical content, oh we have to simplify it) and I&#8217;m just like, it&#8217;s not like an either\u002For, you can actually have both: as long as you have good “signposting” to bring people along.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, this insider\u002Foutsider piece is very salient… coming back to how you think about this from the perspective of crypto, a lot of crypto communities are mostly &#8212; by nature at the moment, right, mostly made up of people who are insiders because they&#8217;ve overcome tremendous technical hurdles to gain access in the first place &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a custodial crypto wallet and you&#8217;re just collecting you know NBA Top Shot NFTs or something like that, you learned a bunch of stuff: You&#8217;ve signed up for a piece of software; you&#8217;ve overcome a bunch of different steps to get in; and you already have some intuition for the lingo, for the lay of the land, for the types of things you might be doing. And for what the crypto actually is: Like what are these digital assets that you&#8217;re trading, or like what are these protocols you&#8217;re interfacing with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one thing is the people who have all done that have a shared text, right &#8212; it&#8217;s very much like puzzlers right, you have this set of shared knowledge and understanding of some basic conventions and features of what a thing might be &#8212; But by the same token, what&#8217;s often most intriguing or exciting are using and remixing all of those ideas in new and powerful ways; right, new, powerful, and hopefully elegant ways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd meanwhile, if you&#8217;re someone who is outside &#8212; right as you were both just saying, like the signposting, and the simple access points to start to understand what&#8217;s going on, are really really important &#8212; and the more complex the eventual exercise is, the more individual signposting steps you need, the more sort of components;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI really connected to Matthew&#8217;s description that first-time puzzlers often have really good instincts, but are afraid to try… And like crypto, because you know still so much of it is so hard to navigate, you could accidentally pay a massive gas fee while trying to do a transaction that doesn&#8217;t even succeed; like there&#8217;s lots of stuff that can go wrong: There&#8217;s the same sort of trepidation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it&#8217;s really important if you&#8217;re building &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re building something that is unusual, and novel, and exciting in all the ways that a new type of puzzle might be &#8212; it&#8217;s all the more incumbent on the builder to provide those sorts of signposting and create the trust and understanding with your user that enables them to enter, and explore, and gain confidence to explore\u003Csup\u003E25\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that&#8217;s an incentive design challenge, right; and that&#8217;s exactly what you have to do when you&#8217;re launching a crypto project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Absolutely. One of the most important principles is that puzzles are experiences, and we need to design them as experiences, not things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo looking at other experiences, a restaurant for instance: When you go to a nice restaurant, your experience starts not when you get served your plate of food &#8212; but from the moment you go to that restaurant&#8217;s website, and make a reservation; and look at the menu; figure out how to get in the door, get seated, order, your conversation with the waiter, how you pay for the food; the entire thing is part of your dining experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, a puzzle experience starts the first touch point of however you&#8217;re engaging with the puzzle &#8212; whether that&#8217;s signing up for a puzzle hunt, or getting an email about a promotional game that an NFT community is putting on. All of this affects your mindset, your motivations going into the game, and really affects how you solve the puzzle, how you experience the puzzles themselves. Those things in my opinion really are inseparable. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, you can design the most amazing crossword puzzle, and if the website that checks your answers breaks while solving it, that&#8217;s a bad puzzle experience. If, halfway through the puzzle you notice a typo in it, and you don’t get a response from the people running the puzzle hunt for three hours; that&#8217;s part of the puzzle experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can&#8217;t really distinguish between the quality of what the puzzle could have been (if it ran perfectly), and the experience you actually had with it. Your feeling of when you solve the puzzle, are you reveling in the victory, or are you worried that you didn&#8217;t win the prize so did it matter??\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This is exactly the experience of being part of an NFT community. If the community does things that don&#8217;t match your expectations in one way or another, they set up a story, and then there&#8217;s like a second like spinoff project, and there&#8217;s no sort of aesthetic sensibility…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne that did it really incredibly recently is Chain Runners &#8212; and I&#8217;m a holder, I&#8217;m a very involved member of the community (so like all biases to be clear, and this is not financial advice, of course) &#8212; but they did something really cool that I liked: So their genesis collection was these sort of pixelated, two-dimensional, characters; you know very sci-fi, cyberpunk characters. And they just launched a three-dimensional, metaverse-ready instantiation of these same types of characters (the Chain Runners). And for the experience of minting the Chain Runners XR (this follow-up collection), normally, when you mint an NFT, you just go to a website or you go to the contract, potentially, and you press some buttons, and then the NFT gets added to your wallet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere… a big part of the story was this emergence from 2-D to 3-D. And, the minting website literally took you into a 3-D world: So, you walked to the computer where you access the mint process. And then once you did the mint, it took you through a tunnel, and like now you&#8217;re in a 3-D mini escape room that you could explore (shoutouts to Nav who did most of the development; and I guess footnote disclosure: I had a little bit of influence on the puzzle design for the escape room).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, then when you solved the escape room, it gave you a code that you could bring back to the Discord server, and it would give you access to a special channel just for the people who ‘d sort of played the full mint experience through solving all the puzzles. It was totally immersive &#8212; you were immersed in almost a video game experience &#8212; but then, it turned out that the game was self-aware: It knew the experience of being a Chain Runner is not just your metaverse immersion, but also the experience with the community in the Discord, and pulls back to something that you take out of this three-dimensional world… that shows the game world and the real world are one and the same, that sort of there&#8217;s a semi-permeable membrane between the two somehow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This actually makes me think, how much puzzles apply so much to token-gated communities, and any other token-gated events; like there’s so many ways to bridge the physical and digital &lt;Scott: exactly&gt; there, as well as in going through tiering to show \u003Cem\u003Ecommitment\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. &lt;Scott: yup&gt; Because the whole point again, is skin in the game and proportional &#8212; not to necessarily financial investment of things &#8212; but actually your contributions, your work, your time, your interest; like that&#8217;s how you know people wanna be in the community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right! I mean people spent literally hours solving this escape-room game in order to gain access to this secret Discord channel. And it was incredible to think of this, realization, right: In the mint experience, people usually pop in and pop out; you&#8217;re talking a minute, you know if you sped up the gas enough, it might be seconds. Whereas here, it became this transformation of the two-dimensional to the three-dimensional world that then gives you something for the outside world as well. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd all of this fits very coherently and intuitively in the mythos of the world the Chain Runners are setting up. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; If instead, the secondary collection had been, I don&#8217;t know, renaissance fair characters or weird like cartoon animals &#8212; like nothing wrong with renaissance character NFTs, nothing wrong with cartoon animal NFTs &#8212; but they would be jarring in the experience of this cyberpunk world. Whereas in the cyberpunk world, the Discord is part of the cyberpunk world too, right; it all sort of comes together and forms a really coherent single piece.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Fantastic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so a question I&#8217;ve been dying to ask you guys throughout this episode, which is who designs the puzzle, like who is the designer. And is the puzzle architect &#8212; like you know, what&#8217;s his name from Hunger Games; I was thinking of (ohmygosh, I forgot his name, the Philip Hoffman character in the movie version but, he had some kinda Greek name) &#8212; but anyway:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn crypto, we have this unique challenge-slash \u002F opportunity of it being decentralized &#8212; even though there are people who have more stakes or are the original creators or have unique IP rights or various things &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Ewho is the creator? \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMatthew made the analogy that this is like software design, and both of you guys have said this; and to me, it strikes me as a very opinionated form of software design. Even if you have it revealing itself in gates, and various forms, it still is sort of almost pre-decided, &lt;Scott: mm&gt; and it made me think again of this notion of like smart contracts, and even formal verification: Like you put the thing out the world, you don&#8217;t get to necessarily edit it after the fact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, I wondered how does and does that not play out as analogies with puzzles and crypto; and, are there cases of successful puzzles where they are actually modified once they&#8217;ve been created, in real-time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh gosh… that is such a great analogy I&#8217;ve never thought of before &#8212; yeah, a puzzle is basically a smart contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat you design and experience, that should proceed in certain ways, and like has boundary conditions and things can happen outside the boundaries, but basically you&#8217;re helping people follow a path where all the components of the path are locked in up front. &lt;Sonal: Encoded!&gt; If you get something wrong &#8212; if you like leave a red herring that&#8217;s really confusing, that people might get lost and sort of fall off the path, and you usually don&#8217;t want to be in the position of retconning (of having to go back and remove a red herring or fix something) &#8212; ideally, it all gets locked in up front, it&#8217;s a smart contract, and then people explore all of the affordances and possibilities of the contract as they go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This leads into another distinction I like to make in puzzle design which is that between “clueing” and “hinting” &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, clues represent the integral, baked-in information needed to solve the puzzle. So a clue is something that is included with the puzzle, that you couldn&#8217;t take it away and be left with a complete puzzle. (Maybe you could still solve it by an arbitrary leap of logic, but the clue structure is really what allows the puzzle to make sense, that allows everything to lock in and be elegantly cohesive.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHinting, in contrast, is what allows you to dynamically adapt to a variety of solving behavior. It acknowledges that different people may get stuck in a certain way of thinking, or not be familiar with something: the puzzle is referring to a specific video game that isn&#8217;t as easily googleable as the designer thought, and the hint allows people who aren&#8217;t familiar with that video game reference to make that connection too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut: When we design a puzzle, we need to take into account both the static and dynamic guardrails for the experience, signposting for the experience &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; &#8212; both how we guide people to solve puzzle on the core path; and how we keep them along the intended experience, if they&#8217;re passing that “threshold of frustration”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E We&#8217;re not here to design puzzles that no one&#8217;s ever gonna be able to solve, right. Some people think the goal is actually to design puzzles that are hard &#8212; and that&#8217;s totally not the goal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This actually relates back to another extension of what I was saying previously about difficulty, which is &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I design a puzzle for different types of audiences, whether it&#8217;s designing a custom puzzle for a specific individual, for a proposal; versus for teams of 3 to 5 people with 200 teams solving at once; versus a 2000-person community solving an ARG and all uniting together to tackle puzzles (And oftentimes it&#8217;s harder to test that experience because I don&#8217;t have a group of 2000 people working together testing a puzzle).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, I approach difficulty very differently, and I approach how precisely I&#8217;m going to clue something differently. I don&#8217;t want the puzzle to be solved within minutes of its release. And at the same time, I don&#8217;t want the a-has to be completely arcane, and random, and unsatisfying. They still need to adhere to the principles of good puzzle design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know it&#8217;s interesting because &#8212; I know you joked earlier Matthew that you don&#8217;t really know games; and I did actually, growing up; I grew up on Atari games as a young child &lt;Matthew: Nice&gt; &#8212; but, one thing keeps coming up, this idea of difficulty\u002F tiering &#8212; I do wanna reference a popular law that came out of the Atari world and Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari, which was:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat games should be “easy to learn but difficult to master”. I&#8217;m just curious if you guys have any thoughts, just this general principle of “Nolan&#8217;s law”, and how that does and doesn&#8217;t apply in this context of puzzles and\u002For crypto design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah I think mastery is an interesting concept when it comes to puzzle hunts. Because, there oftentimes isn&#8217;t the same type of linear, incremental mastery that you see in videogame &lt;Sonal: a game, yah&gt; puzzles, for instance &#8212; once you cross the threshold of a specific puzzle (of knowing how it works), you know how it works; there&#8217;s no going back.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that certainly may influence your knowledge of when approaching any future puzzles of being able to recognize, “Oh I&#8217;ve seen this mechanic before”. But it&#8217;s not necessarily about iterating through a level and finding the best way to solve it, per se.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut: There&#8217;s sort of a “meta mastery” where you&#8217;re building up your skills &#8212; and “skills” not just in terms of recognizing mechanics, and having better-honed logical abilities &#8212; it&#8217;s also knowing your own behavior, the sort of psychological mastery of how you approach solving puzzles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… this actually gets to one of the properties of really broadly impactful puzzle design &#8212; that I somewhat rarely see but often happens accidentally &#8212; which is: Some of the best puzzles stay with you outside of the experience of solving the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd: It can also apply to yourself; it can apply to even just identifying the puzzles in the world around you. And, this actually relates back to what we were saying earlier about the difference between behavior of newer puzzle solvers versus more experienced solvers…  So, puzzles are about creating meaning from noise, from chaos. And through this, we really are telling a narrative; we are telling a cohesive story.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well I don&#8217;t know if it applies, but Loot and the derivatives that the community co-created &#8212; that&#8217;s a case where, there is like this sense of unfolding, but what&#8217;s really fascinating is undoing a lot of classic narrative construction. Because it is being created by the community, &lt;mhm&gt; and then they&#8217;re putting a lore around it. I think it&#8217;s something we see a lot more in crypto because of the decentralized nature of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s really interesting; you know there are memes that take on form in crypto, and the exact same thing happens in the puzzle community &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike, there&#8217;s a puzzle type that was invented where somebody came up with this puzzle format; and the original one I think was just called Duck Konundrum &#8212; That&#8217;s right, Matthew, right? Like, it was just called Duck Konundrum?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah by Dan Katz I believe, in a Mystery Hunt many years ago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. So they introduced this puzzle called &#8220;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fpuzzles.mit.edu\u002F2000\u002Fset5\u002F6\u002FPuzzle.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDuck Konundrum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&#8220;, in which you get rules out of order, and you have to put them in order and then sort of step through all of them &#8212; It&#8217;s like getting a computer program in shards, and having to figure out you know the unique way in which the shards make coherent sense. And what&#8217;s fun about it is: lots of different sequences almost make sense. And then you get to the last one you&#8217;re like, Oh wait no I can&#8217;t- I now can&#8217;t use the last shard &#8212; like the n-minus-one shard has got me to a position that the last shard can&#8217;t act upon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so you’re constantly trying to reorganize this thing in sort of like a meta-logic puzzle somehow. And this was so popular, that people started riffing off of this format, and now it&#8217;s called a “Duck Konundrum” &#8212; like you&#8217;ll open up a puzzle and be like ohmygosh, it&#8217;s another Duck Konundrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s kinda what happened, I think, with releasing bits of Loot. &lt;Scott: Totally!&gt; The community was like they&#8217;d come in at midnight and be like, &#8220;What does this mean,&#8221; and kinda try to figure it out together, you know.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And then these things sort of establish memes, within communities that then start crossing over across communities… And so you can introduce like a new central meme. Like some of Dom&#8217;s work, created a new way of designing an NFT project, that others then started building on, and reformatting, and remixing in different ways. That&#8217;s exactly what happens with puzzles as well. And Duck Konundrums are a perfect example of this…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou now even see ones where there are metareferences made to the duck &#8212; but you know it&#8217;s about alligators or something &#8212; but somehow there&#8217;s a duck that appears midway through the story, and you&#8217;re like wait oh I get it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah.

It&#8217;s very much allowing the experience to periodically evolve &#8212; sometimes through the user interactions, and sometimes through new discoveries. So: puzzling and problem-solving is like formulating a- an incentive design; it often has the same mixture of elegance and precision &#8212; figuring out how to make a crypto design actually work together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally agree.

So when you&#8217;re designing a puzzle, it&#8217;s not just &#8220;I made a crossword, here, solve it&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s everything contextually around how that puzzle is presented &#8212; because the puzzle is the experience that the solver has.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is often overlooked in puzzle contests in any format &#8212; where incentivization structure, the prize structure is part of the puzzle, whether you like it or not. Like in an escape room also: The fact that there is a time limit, is part of the puzzle; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; it&#8217;s not separate from the puzzles. That totally dictates how you engage with the puzzles, whether you&#8217;re taking your time; whether you&#8217;re solving as quickly as possible just to get to the answer and then moving on; or fully solving and appreciating each of the intermediate a-ha’s of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me: A big part of the style of puzzle design I do and enjoy solving is about puzzles as a type of personal expression, and encouraging &lt;Scott: yah&gt; research rabbit-holes, and sharing deep areas of knowledge and hobbies and identities and such &lt;Sonal: yess!&gt; So like I have a background as a software engineer; I&#8217;m also a violinist, I do some visual art stuff; when I design puzzles, it brings in all of these different perspectives. And the a-ha moments I create in puzzles are- whether from existing hobbies or new areas of research rabbit holes that I enjoy leading people down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in particular I think this contrasts with how people often view a specific type of puzzle-solving as influenced by &#8212; the Times crossword specifically; it’s &#8212; you can&#8217;t look things up; It&#8217;s how much you know already &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; If there&#8217;s a way to figure it out, if there&#8217;s a way to sort of piece stuff together, there certainly is more puzzle-y trivia… but trivia on its own isn&#8217;t necessarily a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don&#8217;t necessarily view trivia (in and of itself) as a type of puzzle-solving, simply because it&#8217;s you-know-it-or-you-don&#8217;t. If anything it&#8217;s the exact opposite: I&#8217;m designing the puzzle around getting you to look things up and then keep going deeper, and be four hours into researching &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; asteroid-naming conventions, and suddenly you have this discovery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly; discover this entirely new world that the puzzle introduced you to. And hilariously, this is how I got into NFTs, originally… &lt;Sonal: Oh! Say more!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, for a couple of years (so starting early in the pandemic), Bloomberg had me write a mostly-weekly \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Fstorythreads\u002F2021-03-21\u002Fkominers-s-conundrums-a-treasure-trove-of-puzzles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle column\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. And… you know we tied the columns, when we could, to things that were in the news that were kind of puzzle-y, and potentially of interest to Bloomberg readers. And crypto is of course highly of interest to Bloomberg readers, and so we actually did two puzzles around NFTs:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne right after the Beeple sale &#8212; NFTs feel really puzzle-y, right; like &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; you&#8217;ve got this art that&#8217;s in the open, but it&#8217;s cryptographically secured; and there&#8217;s a bunch of puzzles that are about solving different sorts of codes, or cryptosystems. And so I did a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fopinion\u002Farticles\u002F2021-02-28\u002Fkominers-s-conundrums-the-most-cryptic-piece-of-art-in-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epuzzle\u003C\u002Fa\u003E &#8211;the story was: This new art is in the open; but the address is hidden, can you locate it?

And around the time I was reading a New Yorker article about the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and I was like oh wow these feel really puzzle-y too.

Where typically you&#8217;re in a self-contained environment versus treasure hunting, ARGs etc., are more broadly just site-specific gaming out in the real world (instead of contained in a controlled space). But, escape rooms are so much more than escaping or even just about rooms these days: They&#8217;re really incredible types of immersive gaming experiences that are typically puzzle-driven.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Sorry what does A-R-G stand for again?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Alternate reality game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh okay; keep going, yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Then we also have types of pervasive puzzle experiences &#8212; pulling from the great book “Pervasive Games” which uses that term to describe games that exist out in the real world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, this takes a few different forms most notably, alternate reality games: Which are sort of narrative-driven (often times also puzzle-driven games), juxtaposed on the real world &#8212; where anything and everything in the world can be part of a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere also are more contained, but also site-specific, types of puzzling: this includes treasure hunts, letterboxing, geocaching &#8212; various types of engagement with in-person sites, where you’re solving puzzles out in the real world &#8212; urban treasure hunts as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDid I miss anything Scott?

Now that we have a high-level lay of the land of puzzle types, I’d love go even deeper into the puzzle mediums – or, I guess what you just called Matthew the “puzzle presentation” aspect &#8212; especially when it comes to puzzle hunts (which you both won and mentioned a lot!)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Certainly! So, it&#8217;s sort of hard to describe as one thing, but they have a few general properties &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETypically, each puzzle solves to a word or phrase as a final answer. So in contrast to maybe a New York Times crossword, where a correctly filled in grid is the answer to the puzzle; in a puzzle hunt, if you had a crossword, it would go one step further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And that might be reading every square that has a prime number in it or something. &lt;Sonal: Got it&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;d be a clue that led you to realize, the prime numbers mattered or something.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly. Which gets to… In a crossword, you sort of know what you&#8217;re doing when you&#8217;re presented with a puzzle: You know that you have some clues, and you need to answer the clues, and fill them into a grid.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a puzzle hunt, oftentimes the puzzle is figuring out what to do: You&#8217;re presented with some information, some piece of data, some object. And, puzzle-hunt puzzles will oftentimes have (what&#8217;s called) “flavor text” accompanying them, which gives some keywords\u003Csup\u003E18\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E that you need to pay special attention to, keying in on what might be going on in the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut typically it requires: pattern observation, paying attention to small details, noticing what might be amiss, applying common techniques. You have some clues, figure out what the answers might be. Maybe some of the clues are a little bit too ambiguous to figure out the answer at first, but you fill in the ones that you know for sure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then maybe you notice that &#8212; this is just gonna be an example of a very generic, simple puzzle-hunt style puzzle &#8212; maybe you noticed that the left column of the answers, the answers are in alphabetical order; but the right column, the answers seem to be in some particular order. And then you notice that the left column maybe, are anagrams of one of the answers in the right column plus a letter. That type of wordplay is called a “transaddition”. So you match one from the left column, one to the right column; since the left column (the alphabetized ones), already has a strict ordering, you know that probably the ordering of the right column answers matters. And then maybe the extra letters spell out a clue phrase, which then clues some final word is the final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat might be the flow for &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; a really generic style of this puzzle. &lt;Sonal: Got it&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, there are things to figure out along the way; you don&#8217;t necessarily know what the later steps are &#8212; but there are layers that reveal themselves as you progress through the puzzle. And somehow you can get a final answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother property\u003Csup\u003E46\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E of puzzle hunts is “metapuzzles”. At the end of the round, you metapuzzle &#8212; which, in some way uses the answers to all the individual puzzles in that round &#8212; which are called the “feeder” puzzle answers. Again this can take so so many different forms; &lt;Sonal: yah!&gt; I&#8217;m not even going to try and get into examples of that now…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are sort of two categories of metapuzzles: “shell” metapuzzles or “shell-less” metapuzzles. Shell metapuzzles means that you&#8217;re presented with some extra information for the metapuzzle. Whereas shell-less means that the metapuzzle is elegantly contained just within the answers themselves. One is not necessarily better than the other, but, it certainly can be a level more elegant if you can make a shell-less metapuzzle &#8212; where there&#8217;s that extra layer of hidden meaning contained within the answers staring you in the face the entire time. That then once you&#8217;ve solved all of these individual puzzles (that individually are cohesive satisfying experiences), you then reveal another entirely new layer of meaning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, the structure can continue on from there; there can be meta metapuzzles that combine all the metapuzzles. Metapuzzle structures can get really creative: So, they can use more than just even the answers to the feeder puzzles. They can also use some version of the mechanics to the feeder puzzles. They can use answers to feeder puzzles from previous rounds, sort of a waterfall\u002F cascade structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favorite MIT Mystery Hunt puzzle rounds &#8212; the world&#8217;s biggest annual puzzle hunt which happens at MIT annually in January; it involves thousands of participants, hundreds of puzzles; it&#8217;s all-out battle-royale of puzzles, with pulling out all the stops in terms of difficulty and depth and such &#8212; one of my all-time favorite metapuzzle structures I&#8217;ve seen was in the 2020 Mystery Hunt designed by Galactic Trendsetters.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The official team name is like &#8220;Whoosh, Galactic Trendsetters, screeeee…&#8221; right, there you go. &lt;Matthew: Yes, that one&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Nice sound effects, Scott! &lt;Scott: thank you&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The sound effects are part of their name &lt;Sonal: I love it (laughs)&gt;; I mispronounced it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut they had this one round, the nano round &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if you remember this Scott~\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E ~Oh god yah that was epic~\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E ~Yah; Where normally, you have a bunch of feeder puzzles, and then there&#8217;s a metapuzzle at the end.

But I think a bigger theme that I&#8217;m getting at here is &#8212; puzzle design has to be for a specific audience. A puzzle is not a good puzzle generally, it&#8217;s a good puzzle relative to who it&#8217;s designed to be solved by.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if I&#8217;m designing a puzzle for team-building activity for a tech company, for a bunch of software engineers, I know I can rely on a certain type of analytical thinking and communication skills, but not on knowledge of puzzle conventions. &lt;Sonal: Right&gt; But I will know that software engineers intuitively will know what puzzle indexing is, because indexing is a key concept in programming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVersus if I&#8217;m designing a puzzle hunt for an audience of puzzle hunters, &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; I can&#8217;t just design generic\u003Csup\u003E97\u003C\u002Fsup\u003Epuzzles and expect them to be interesting and thought-provoking &#8212; because those people will know all the conventions; they&#8217;ll know what to expect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, when I&#8217;m designing for that sort of audience, I&#8217;m intending to subvert their expectations relative to how they would expect the puzzles to unfold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, if I&#8217;m designing a music puzzle for an audience of musicians, I can design a-ha moments, I can design shifts in perception around getting those musicians to maybe see conventions of musical notation, or manipulate audio files in a way that is novel to them. Versus if I&#8217;m designing a music puzzle for an audience of non-musicians, I may pick something that&#8217;s a special property of music that myself as a musician, something that I want to share with those people… Some a-ha I&#8217;ve had about music; and I&#8217;ll use the structure of the puzzle to get the solvers to experience that moment on their own.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Teach!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPuzzles have this really special property &#8212; in contrast to other types of game and interaction design &#8212; where you&#8217;re not telling people what to do; you&#8217;re providing them with some materials, some experiential framing that leads them to figure out what to do on their own. And, when done properly, it sets them up for these really powerful moments of revelation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So to pick on this education note for a moment &#8212; Scott just said, it’s like teaching &#8212; and I came from the world of developmental psychology (that was my grad work); and one of the things that was very much in vogue was you know this idea of constructivism and how students learn. It was an NSF grant, National Science Foundation grant that I was on about early numeracy in preschoolers; and it was how you harness children&#8217;s natural numeracy and skills, before they even have any formal systems for learning math.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, what was super fascinating about it is the philosophy of this Russian cognitive psychologist &#8212; Vygotsky, who wrote a book called \u003Cem\u003EMind in Society\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; and one of the key concepts that comes up is this idea of “scaffolding”… as a way to set up the learning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the ideal teacher essentially &#8212; in this context (and this applies in Montessori, Reggio Emilia, lots of school practices) &#8212; they essentially set up a scaffolding in the environment, that this child or student or person then explores, to construct their own learning. And that&#8217;s literally just kinda like what you just said and how &lt;Scott: One hundred percent&gt; it maps to puzzle design. And it&#8217;s like what you said Scott about education, it&#8217;s like teaching.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s exactly it; and we should both talk about the sort of philosophies of puzzle design. But for me, this scaffolding component is absolutely central &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want people to be able to make discoveries right; you want a discovery to feel like an accomplishment and a major a-ha… But you also want to sort of enable them to make constant forward progress in some sense, right. Like it&#8217;s okay to get stuck sometimes or it&#8217;s okay to you know be thinking like where is this puzzle taking me &#8212; but it shouldn&#8217;t be a way\u002F in the sense that you&#8217;re stuck in that like you wanna quit. It&#8217;s you&#8217;re stuck, but you&#8217;re so intrigued that you have to, and you want to, understand and you wanna enable yourself to have that level-up &#8212; that it sort of continues to pull you forward even if it&#8217;s by tiny, little, marginal bits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the other thing: You have to really engage with the content of the idea or of the experience as you solve; like solving a puzzle is by nature active.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right, it&#8217;s not a passive activity; you&#8217;re not just like a recipient of a one-way dissemination &lt;Scott: Yah&gt; &#8212; or you&#8217;re receiving it in a very deeply immersive way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. Puzzle hunts and alternate reality games are especially intriguing because they are fertile ground for really densely layered puzzle architectures &#8212; contrasting with other types of puzzles where, you sort of know what you&#8217;re supposed to do; it&#8217;s more figuring out how to do it, than figuring out what to do, &lt;Sonal: mmm… mhm&gt; and then sort of peeling back layer upon layer. So what you were saying with scaffolding is absolutely spot on. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd because there’s more intricate architecture &#8212; because there is more scaffolding to sort of implicitly contained puzzle experience &#8212; there are so many opportunities for unexpected moments along the journey.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know actually just on that note, like, what strikes me about what you&#8217;re saying there Matthew… is: It&#8217;s not just like learning but how to learn; it&#8217;s creating these systems in your head.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it reminds me so much again of the work when I was in grad school in developmental psychology, and cognitive psychology because it&#8217;s also very closely tied to this other hot topic back then &#8212; which was metacognition, and like awareness of your own mind, and how you think and navigate a system &#8212; And of course this then connects to even the interesting question of what happens when computer AI solves puzzles right; like we&#8217;ve talked about this actually on my old podcast (the a16z Podcast), a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Ftag\u002Fdeepmind\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enumber of episodes on AlphaGo\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and how humans can learn differently from computers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The computer-solving-puzzles point is really fascinating, because I make a distinction in puzzle design between the solution and the answer &lt;Scott: yes&gt; &lt;Sonal: mhm…!&gt; &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is sort of the flag at the end of the puzzle: It&#8217;s the answer word or phrase that means that you&#8217;ve solved it; it&#8217;s the grid-is-correct notification you get when you correctly solve a crossword; it means that, yes, you&#8217;ve reached the intended end point of the puzzle. Whereas the solution is the intended path getting there. And what really matters about the puzzle (generally speaking, of course there are exceptions to this), is the \u003Cem\u003Esolution\u003C\u002Fem\u003E not so much the answer. The answer confirms that you followed the correct solution path &#8212; but, what really matters is&#8211; “it&#8217;s the journey, not the destination”… in puzzle form.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the solution path is sort of a dance between the solver and the designer. It&#8217;s in part architected when the puzzle is designed &#8212; but in part played out uniquely by each solver &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;, as they circle their way around the answer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It’s part of why it&#8217;s fun to do in teams, right; it&#8217;s a lot like engineering a new piece of software or something &#8212; you have people with different backgrounds, and experiences, and intuitions, and expertise &#8212; that together can sort of crack even the very complicated or extremely difficult puzzles and puzzle hunts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know footnote, for example: I have a perfect record of solving every “We Didn&#8217;t Start the Fire”-related &lt;Sonal chuckles&gt; puzzle that has been in Mystery Hunts since I started competing in Mystery Hunts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, the reason &#8220;We Didn&#8217;t Start the Fire&#8221; crops up frequently is &#8212; remember Matthew was explaining this idea that like you need to somehow get to a word or phrase in the answer or something? &#8212; And he mentioned this idea of an ordering, right, like maybe one column, everything&#8217;s in alphabetical order, or one thing and they&#8217;re not; and that not in alphabetical order column might tell you which order you wanna put the input data into or something &#8211;With really serious puzzlers, you&#8217;re often looking for a way to induce an ordering that is not like something as simple as alphabetical order, &lt;Sonal: mm&gt; or periodic table order, or something like a standard way of putting things in an order…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it&#8217;s useful to have lists of things in canonical orders &#8212; where, if you don&#8217;t know what the list means, like if you don&#8217;t recognize the list, you might have to think a little bit to figure out that this is the list of objects.

In the context of a competition, when something is framed as a competitive puzzle hunt and you need to call on this final answer &#8212; sure, it&#8217;s marked as solved; but solving the puzzle for me really is about experiencing that shift in perception.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah.

That it needs to be a proportionately satisfying payoff for the solver, to make them want to go through this process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you really put in the legwork, feeling like you&#8217;re making progress &#8212; not just grinding and not getting anywhere &#8212; but when you finally overcome the final hurdle, it&#8217;s all the more satisfying because of the work that you&#8217;ve put in. When that work is designed in such a way so that it does feel like it&#8217;s leading into the final answer, instead of just sort of fizzling off at the end. When done well can be this really climactic moment of revelation. &lt;Sonal: Yeah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis gets into another point, which is: A puzzle needs to be designed such that what it gates&#8211; So, gating in puzzle design or escape room design, game design generally &#8212; means, there&#8217;s something preventing you from accessing further content: So in the case of an escape room, it might be a padlock that you have to put a number into that opens a chest that has a new item you need. Or in the case of a puzzle hunt, it might be typing in your answer to a puzzle, which in turn unlocks a new round of puzzles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gating needs to be conceived such that it&#8217;s worth fully solving the puzzle, it&#8217;s worth &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; getting a satisfying experience instead of being inclined to sidestep that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, to give a simple example from a sort of escape room-type mindset: If you have a padlock on a chest, the a-ha of the puzzle aligns with the satisfaction of the lock popping open, and then you move on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, say you had four separate puzzles that each gave you one digit &#8212; in addition to it not being very satisfying to just get a digit from zero through nine from a puzzle &#8212; It also means that when you get down to that last puzzle, it&#8217;s not a matter of if I fully solve this one puzzle that has a cohesive mechanic, but rather, do I go through the process of solving this last puzzle? Or do I do what&#8217;s probably less effort of just spinning the last dial?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you&#8217;re sort of gating yourself instead of the game gating you. So, the stakes for the a-ha feel less real because you&#8217;re sort of breaking the immersion. It really has to be worth it for you to solve that last puzzle &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; if that requires more effort than the other path of just brute-forcing it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis applies to competitive framing as well: Does it make sense to fully solve the puzzle; are you borrowing the answer from a different team who you happen to hear the answer from. What types of behavior are you incentivizing? And, is the path of least resistance &#8212; is that the experience you want solvers to take? What types of behavior at each possible point throughout the experience, are you setting them up for?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So talking about incentive design and behavioral design &lt;Matthew: yah&gt;, and this, obviously maps onto crypto &#8212; given what we&#8217;ve talked about so far, taxonomy of puzzles, some of the mechanics, some of the design, some of the software analogies &#8212; how would you think about this in the context of crypto?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well first of all, it&#8217;s very similar to the intellectual challenge of designing an incentive scheme. Like how is your token going to work; what is it going to do or enable your community to do? What will happen as people start to engage with it; how will the experience evolve? Like these are all the same types of questions that you sort of formulate when you&#8217;re constructing a puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike I often think of a token system as being sort of a big community puzzle environment, that&#8217;s set up by the project creators, and enabling it to evolve and build upon itself in exactly the way that like a collaborative puzzle-solving exercise works. And that means that as the designer that you have to think about all of these things that Matthew was just talking about in terms of puzzle design: You want it to drive incentives that make people excited about engaging and exploring the boundaries of what your design can do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also wanna make the thing feel intuitive &#8212; even if it&#8217;s new; right something can be novel and yet sort of be intuitive at every step of engagement &#8212; And if you&#8217;re a crypto project that&#8217;s trying to reach broad consumers, you&#8217;re facing very much the same design challenge that Matthew and I face when we write puzzles for general audiences. It turns out: you can get people in very very general audiences to solve incredibly difficult puzzles… even thinking going in that they&#8217;re not gonna be able to, if you design the architecture of the puzzle in a way that sort of leads them along, and then the unlocks start to appear, and then they gain confidence and understanding of the structure of the puzzle as they go, and it can get harder. Similarly, that&#8217;s very much how a crypto project &#8212; especially one that&#8217;s trying to reach an audience that&#8217;s not already deep in the weeds of crypto, but rather that is going to engage with it and sort of use it as an exploration and a path in…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then similarly, this point about audiences, right &#8212; the idea that the same thing will be interpreted very differently by two audiences with different experiences and different backgrounds &#8212; this crops up in crypto design all the time, too. Even just the interfaces through which we interact with crypto, right: Are you using a custodial wallet or a non-custodial wallet; are you minting on a website, or are you minting through the contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, you see you see NFT launches that are only minted through contract. And why is that? The aesthetic of what the project is trying to accomplish, they essentially want to limit to people who have the technical sophistication to access it in this way: It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re trying to be a closed community for the sake of just being insular, rather, the technical complexity of joining is helping screen for the audience that they think will actually appreciate what they&#8217;re doing. &lt;Sonal: Yeah…&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo in a puzzle hunt, often the first puzzles or the first round of puzzles are much more accessible than the others. And then if you find that the environment and the ecosystem being set up by the project is one that feels right, then you might start working really hard and be willing to like put much more effort in. And all of that pulls back to a design problem on behalf of the creator &#8212; right, if you&#8217;re creating this project, you want to enable people to dip their toe in and then discover &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; they want to swim and then you know also immerse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, that intro round really is a welcome &#8212; but it&#8217;s also about building trust in the integrity of the design. It&#8217;s also an opportunity to level the playing field just a little bit. &lt;Scott: yes&gt; So, when people are newer to puzzles, they may not be as familiar with the conventions &#8212; or even just the conventions of a particular designer or design team &#8212; and those newer puzzles are opportunities to present the atomic elements of whatever puzzle world people are being presented with. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, like in a video game where you&#8217;re maybe taught some basic mechanics, and then you&#8217;re throwing variation after variation and hybrids of those variations &#8212; similarly with puzzle mechanics, you&#8217;re introducing people to the general style and aesthetics and what they can do, what they can&#8217;t do: Are the puzzles going totally outside of the box, and expecting you to dive into the source code, and use real-world components? Are they all just contained within PDF? Are you expected to maybe interact with other teams who have different types of data than you?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThey&#8217;re establishing the rules of the world that you&#8217;re playing in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Which that is also a component of crypto projects &#8212; Every crypto project you&#8217;re entering into, by conceptual definition, has a set of rules, and ecosystem constraints, and features that you have to learn as a new entrant.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so when you&#8217;re onboarding new people, you have to sort of help them understand like what your ecosystem feels like, and what its boundaries are, like what it contains, and how it might evolve.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s funny this reminds me so much of the art of onboarding &lt;Scott: yes&gt; &#8212; into any new open-source community, and any community in general &#8212; But particularly in open source, there&#8217;s a whole school of thought \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2017\u002F04\u002F08\u002Fculture-open-source-community\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eabout how\u003C\u002Fa\u003E the attention you pay proactively to really having good onboarding documentation, mentoring, partnerships, people who can kinda hold your hand, guide you, shepherd you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, we might be talking about a nuance in puzzles where people might actually like solving it themselves; but to your guys&#8217; point, they don&#8217;t wanna feel like they&#8217;re just flitting about in something that&#8217;s just really rough and raggedly designed and they have to like slog through it. They wanna get the intentionality (to Matthew&#8217;s point), that they are in a trusted place, where someone has intentionally put things together for them; &lt;yah&gt; so I think that&#8217;s a really great analogy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne quick thing: The two of you are kinda dancing in a really interesting tension between both the idea of insider access, and the idea of accessibility &lt;Scott: yes&gt; It&#8217;s almost like a bit of a paradox &#8212; Okay there&#8217;s a little signaling to your like-minded, quote-&#8220;community&#8221;, whatever it is, it could be cut across whatever level &#8212; a certain domain knowledge, a certain specialty, a certain interest; it could just be puzzles in the meta. Or, there&#8217;s also the sense of, well, how do we also make it not too insular and inaccessible to people joining? &lt;Scott: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause honestly when I hear you guys talk, it feels extremely intricate\u003Csup\u003E73\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E and internal &#8212; and frankly just to draw the analogy to crypto &#8212; that also comes up quite a bit with people feeling like they&#8217;re entering into a crypto community. So I&#8217;d love you to kinda break down how this works in the puzzle world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally; this is such a great question.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So I think this touches on a few things. One is, how to approach difficulty in puzzle design. Because difficult puzzles can be fun, but it&#8217;s a lot harder to design an easy novel elegant puzzle than it is to design a difficult puzzle. And of course it&#8217;s challenging to design a difficult puzzle that is also elegant and satisfying… But the easiest type of puzzle to design is a very very difficult puzzle that absolutely nobody can solve and nobody would have fun solving. And, we see plenty of people doing this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, one of the safeguards against this is of course, “playtesting” &#8212; where when you come up with a puzzle idea, implement it, you don&#8217;t just release it to your solvers; you show it to some playtesters first who are a curated community of people. When I&#8217;m designing a project, depending on the audience and timeline and budget, I&#8217;ll have anywhere from one or two playtesters to dozens across multiple rounds &#8212; from people playtesting sort of a stub of the initial idea, to a fully implemented draft, to final proofing the sort of post-prod, fully artified version of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I&#8217;m designing a puzzle hunt for a crypto community for instance, it&#8217;s likely that those people aren&#8217;t going to be familiar with puzzle hunts already. They aren&#8217;t going to know all of these conventions and all of the sort of in-the-weeds nuances that Scott and I are discussing here. And, to some extent they don&#8217;t have to, but to some extent we also need to meet them halfway: We need to recognize what their behaviors are going to be, what their initial perceptions are going to be, how to properly engage them and really get them excited about exploring this world in the way that we hope for them to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it&#8217;s important to playtest with a representative sampling of the type of community who is actually going to be playing the game. So, I have (for my own puzzle work) a private Discord server where I have a bunch of puzzle people who regularly playtest my puzzles, give me their feedback, make sure the actual puzzle mechanics work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then when I&#8217;m figuring out the exact framing of the puzzle, how it&#8217;s going to be presented, the flavor text, the hints that accompany the puzzle, I&#8217;m not playtesting with those people still &#8212; I&#8217;m finding some people who are of a similar demographic, similar background to the actual people who are going to be solving my hunt. And, that allows me to sort of gauge the way the puzzles are going to be received, before they&#8217;re actually out in the field. And if things go terribly wrong then, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the hunt is going to be wrong, it is going to be totally broken; &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; I can adjust accordingly in advance. &lt;Sonal: that’s great&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is similar to software development cycles as well: &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; We would never release a piece of software without unit-testing everything, and integration testing everything, and making sure that it fully works at all stages. We would never commit one final code change and be like oh it worked in the last stage &lt;Sonal: yah… totally&gt; so it probably still works; we would run all of our tests again before releasing it. And the same applies to experience design and its many forms, and especially to puzzle design, where, we are actively encouraging solvers to pay attention to every last detail to get in the mindset that anything could be part of the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… in an elegant puzzle-hunt style puzzle, everything sort of is part of the puzzle. We&#8217;re not adding in random text that seems puzzle-y but actually means nothing. There&#8217;s a lot of attention paid to making sure that any actual noise in the puzzle couldn&#8217;t be interpreted as meaningful noise. &lt;Sonal: right!&gt; So that means if we expect the solvers to put a list of data in a new ordering based on some property of the data, we intentionally put the data initially in some ordering that&#8217;s clearly not the final ordering. So like I was saying previously, that can be alphabetical ordering, that can be a bullet-point list rather than a numbered list; various things to signal the type of behavior we expect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what this all translates to in terms of access to the community, is: Not that we should design easier puzzles, but rather that we should give accessible points to people and welcome them into this community. Where, by the final puzzle, the solvers are solving things that they didn&#8217;t realize they were able to &#8212; they&#8217;re presented with something that would&#8217;ve seemed utterly impenetrable at the beginning… but by the end through the way in which the game has guided them to build up their abilities they realize that yes, they&#8217;re able to do this as well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this actually gets at one of the biggest differences between newer puzzlers, and people who are familiar with these styles of puzzles (or any styles of puzzles really) &#8212; which is: Simply just the willingness to try things. Oftentimes when I&#8217;m running puzzles of any level of difficulty for people who are new to puzzles, they&#8217;ll prematurely come to me or whoever is running the game, for hints. And of course, prior to telling them what to do, we&#8217;ll say, &#8220;What have you tried so far?&#8221; And oftentimes they&#8217;ll make a correct observation; they&#8217;ll describe part of the solution, and then I&#8217;ll reply &#8220;Well, did you try that?&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so many times I hear the response, &#8220;No, because I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would be correct.&#8221; And it&#8217;s that willingness to just try that really differentiates those more novice solvers from more experienced solvers who are willing to go down a rabbit hole, see if it works… and then embrace the fact that even when it doesn&#8217;t work, they perhaps learn something interesting along the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s so fascinating ‘cause earlier when you talked about the &#8220;payoff&#8221; &#8212; that was like a word that I use in editorial all the time &#8212; because a lot of people have these religious debates about how long a piece should be… &lt;Matthew: mhm&gt; and I always say length is arbitrary to me, quite frankly; it&#8217;s really about the “payoff proportional” to what you&#8217;re putting in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, editorially, when you just described that like the designer has to put in these sort of intermediate things, and things to kinda bring people along – and-and you again, reinforced this idea of trust &#8212; it made me think of a very editorial concept that I use all the time when it comes to religious debates between quote-&#8220;dumbing things down&#8221; or not (‘cause a lot of people say, oh technical content, oh we have to simplify it) and I&#8217;m just like, it&#8217;s not like an either\u002For, you can actually have both: as long as you have good “signposting” to bring people along.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, this insider\u002Foutsider piece is very salient… coming back to how you think about this from the perspective of crypto, a lot of crypto communities are mostly &#8212; by nature at the moment, right, mostly made up of people who are insiders because they&#8217;ve overcome tremendous technical hurdles to gain access in the first place &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a custodial crypto wallet and you&#8217;re just collecting you know NBA Top Shot NFTs or something like that, you learned a bunch of stuff: You&#8217;ve signed up for a piece of software; you&#8217;ve overcome a bunch of different steps to get in; and you already have some intuition for the lingo, for the lay of the land, for the types of things you might be doing. And for what the crypto actually is: Like what are these digital assets that you&#8217;re trading, or like what are these protocols you&#8217;re interfacing with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one thing is the people who have all done that have a shared text, right &#8212; it&#8217;s very much like puzzlers right, you have this set of shared knowledge and understanding of some basic conventions and features of what a thing might be &#8212; But by the same token, what&#8217;s often most intriguing or exciting are using and remixing all of those ideas in new and powerful ways; right, new, powerful, and hopefully elegant ways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd meanwhile, if you&#8217;re someone who is outside &#8212; right as you were both just saying, like the signposting, and the simple access points to start to understand what&#8217;s going on, are really really important &#8212; and the more complex the eventual exercise is, the more individual signposting steps you need, the more sort of components;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI really connected to Matthew&#8217;s description that first-time puzzlers often have really good instincts, but are afraid to try… And like crypto, because you know still so much of it is so hard to navigate, you could accidentally pay a massive gas fee while trying to do a transaction that doesn&#8217;t even succeed; like there&#8217;s lots of stuff that can go wrong: There&#8217;s the same sort of trepidation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it&#8217;s really important if you&#8217;re building &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re building something that is unusual, and novel, and exciting in all the ways that a new type of puzzle might be &#8212; it&#8217;s all the more incumbent on the builder to provide those sorts of signposting and create the trust and understanding with your user that enables them to enter, and explore, and gain confidence to explore\u003Csup\u003E25\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E further.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that&#8217;s an incentive design challenge, right; and that&#8217;s exactly what you have to do when you&#8217;re launching a crypto project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Absolutely. One of the most important principles is that puzzles are experiences, and we need to design them as experiences, not things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo looking at other experiences, a restaurant for instance: When you go to a nice restaurant, your experience starts not when you get served your plate of food &#8212; but from the moment you go to that restaurant&#8217;s website, and make a reservation; and look at the menu; figure out how to get in the door, get seated, order, your conversation with the waiter, how you pay for the food; the entire thing is part of your dining experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, a puzzle experience starts the first touch point of however you&#8217;re engaging with the puzzle &#8212; whether that&#8217;s signing up for a puzzle hunt, or getting an email about a promotional game that an NFT community is putting on. All of this affects your mindset, your motivations going into the game, and really affects how you solve the puzzle, how you experience the puzzles themselves. Those things in my opinion really are inseparable. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, you can design the most amazing crossword puzzle, and if the website that checks your answers breaks while solving it, that&#8217;s a bad puzzle experience. If, halfway through the puzzle you notice a typo in it, and you don’t get a response from the people running the puzzle hunt for three hours; that&#8217;s part of the puzzle experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can&#8217;t really distinguish between the quality of what the puzzle could have been (if it ran perfectly), and the experience you actually had with it. Your feeling of when you solve the puzzle, are you reveling in the victory, or are you worried that you didn&#8217;t win the prize so did it matter??\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This is exactly the experience of being part of an NFT community. If the community does things that don&#8217;t match your expectations in one way or another, they set up a story, and then there&#8217;s like a second like spinoff project, and there&#8217;s no sort of aesthetic sensibility…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne that did it really incredibly recently is Chain Runners &#8212; and I&#8217;m a holder, I&#8217;m a very involved member of the community (so like all biases to be clear, and this is not financial advice, of course) &#8212; but they did something really cool that I liked: So their genesis collection was these sort of pixelated, two-dimensional, characters; you know very sci-fi, cyberpunk characters. And they just launched a three-dimensional, metaverse-ready instantiation of these same types of characters (the Chain Runners). And for the experience of minting the Chain Runners XR (this follow-up collection), normally, when you mint an NFT, you just go to a website or you go to the contract, potentially, and you press some buttons, and then the NFT gets added to your wallet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere… a big part of the story was this emergence from 2-D to 3-D. And, the minting website literally took you into a 3-D world: So, you walked to the computer where you access the mint process. And then once you did the mint, it took you through a tunnel, and like now you&#8217;re in a 3-D mini escape room that you could explore (shoutouts to Nav who did most of the development; and I guess footnote disclosure: I had a little bit of influence on the puzzle design for the escape room).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, then when you solved the escape room, it gave you a code that you could bring back to the Discord server, and it would give you access to a special channel just for the people who ‘d sort of played the full mint experience through solving all the puzzles. It was totally immersive &#8212; you were immersed in almost a video game experience &#8212; but then, it turned out that the game was self-aware: It knew the experience of being a Chain Runner is not just your metaverse immersion, but also the experience with the community in the Discord, and pulls back to something that you take out of this three-dimensional world… that shows the game world and the real world are one and the same, that sort of there&#8217;s a semi-permeable membrane between the two somehow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This actually makes me think, how much puzzles apply so much to token-gated communities, and any other token-gated events; like there’s so many ways to bridge the physical and digital &lt;Scott: exactly&gt; there, as well as in going through tiering to show \u003Cem\u003Ecommitment\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. &lt;Scott: yup&gt; Because the whole point again, is skin in the game and proportional &#8212; not to necessarily financial investment of things &#8212; but actually your contributions, your work, your time, your interest; like that&#8217;s how you know people wanna be in the community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right! I mean people spent literally hours solving this escape-room game in order to gain access to this secret Discord channel. And it was incredible to think of this, realization, right: In the mint experience, people usually pop in and pop out; you&#8217;re talking a minute, you know if you sped up the gas enough, it might be seconds. Whereas here, it became this transformation of the two-dimensional to the three-dimensional world that then gives you something for the outside world as well. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd all of this fits very coherently and intuitively in the mythos of the world the Chain Runners are setting up. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; If instead, the secondary collection had been, I don&#8217;t know, renaissance fair characters or weird like cartoon animals &#8212; like nothing wrong with renaissance character NFTs, nothing wrong with cartoon animal NFTs &#8212; but they would be jarring in the experience of this cyberpunk world. Whereas in the cyberpunk world, the Discord is part of the cyberpunk world too, right; it all sort of comes together and forms a really coherent single piece.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Fantastic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so a question I&#8217;ve been dying to ask you guys throughout this episode, which is who designs the puzzle, like who is the designer. And is the puzzle architect &#8212; like you know, what&#8217;s his name from Hunger Games; I was thinking of (ohmygosh, I forgot his name, the Philip Hoffman character in the movie version but, he had some kinda Greek name) &#8212; but anyway:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn crypto, we have this unique challenge-slash \u002F opportunity of it being decentralized &#8212; even though there are people who have more stakes or are the original creators or have unique IP rights or various things &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Ewho is the creator? \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMatthew made the analogy that this is like software design, and both of you guys have said this; and to me, it strikes me as a very opinionated form of software design. Even if you have it revealing itself in gates, and various forms, it still is sort of almost pre-decided, &lt;Scott: mm&gt; and it made me think again of this notion of like smart contracts, and even formal verification: Like you put the thing out the world, you don&#8217;t get to necessarily edit it after the fact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, I wondered how does and does that not play out as analogies with puzzles and crypto; and, are there cases of successful puzzles where they are actually modified once they&#8217;ve been created, in real-time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh gosh… that is such a great analogy I&#8217;ve never thought of before &#8212; yeah, a puzzle is basically a smart contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat you design and experience, that should proceed in certain ways, and like has boundary conditions and things can happen outside the boundaries, but basically you&#8217;re helping people follow a path where all the components of the path are locked in up front. &lt;Sonal: Encoded!&gt; If you get something wrong &#8212; if you like leave a red herring that&#8217;s really confusing, that people might get lost and sort of fall off the path, and you usually don&#8217;t want to be in the position of retconning (of having to go back and remove a red herring or fix something) &#8212; ideally, it all gets locked in up front, it&#8217;s a smart contract, and then people explore all of the affordances and possibilities of the contract as they go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This leads into another distinction I like to make in puzzle design which is that between “clueing” and “hinting” &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, clues represent the integral, baked-in information needed to solve the puzzle. So a clue is something that is included with the puzzle, that you couldn&#8217;t take it away and be left with a complete puzzle. (Maybe you could still solve it by an arbitrary leap of logic, but the clue structure is really what allows the puzzle to make sense, that allows everything to lock in and be elegantly cohesive.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHinting, in contrast, is what allows you to dynamically adapt to a variety of solving behavior. It acknowledges that different people may get stuck in a certain way of thinking, or not be familiar with something: the puzzle is referring to a specific video game that isn&#8217;t as easily googleable as the designer thought, and the hint allows people who aren&#8217;t familiar with that video game reference to make that connection too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut: When we design a puzzle, we need to take into account both the static and dynamic guardrails for the experience, signposting for the experience &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; &#8212; both how we guide people to solve puzzle on the core path; and how we keep them along the intended experience, if they&#8217;re passing that “threshold of frustration”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E We&#8217;re not here to design puzzles that no one&#8217;s ever gonna be able to solve, right. Some people think the goal is actually to design puzzles that are hard &#8212; and that&#8217;s totally not the goal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This actually relates back to another extension of what I was saying previously about difficulty, which is &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I design a puzzle for different types of audiences, whether it&#8217;s designing a custom puzzle for a specific individual, for a proposal; versus for teams of 3 to 5 people with 200 teams solving at once; versus a 2000-person community solving an ARG and all uniting together to tackle puzzles (And oftentimes it&#8217;s harder to test that experience because I don&#8217;t have a group of 2000 people working together testing a puzzle).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, I approach difficulty very differently, and I approach how precisely I&#8217;m going to clue something differently. I don&#8217;t want the puzzle to be solved within minutes of its release. And at the same time, I don&#8217;t want the a-has to be completely arcane, and random, and unsatisfying. They still need to adhere to the principles of good puzzle design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know it&#8217;s interesting because &#8212; I know you joked earlier Matthew that you don&#8217;t really know games; and I did actually, growing up; I grew up on Atari games as a young child &lt;Matthew: Nice&gt; &#8212; but, one thing keeps coming up, this idea of difficulty\u002F tiering &#8212; I do wanna reference a popular law that came out of the Atari world and Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari, which was:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat games should be “easy to learn but difficult to master”. I&#8217;m just curious if you guys have any thoughts, just this general principle of “Nolan&#8217;s law”, and how that does and doesn&#8217;t apply in this context of puzzles and\u002For crypto design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah I think mastery is an interesting concept when it comes to puzzle hunts. Because, there oftentimes isn&#8217;t the same type of linear, incremental mastery that you see in videogame &lt;Sonal: a game, yah&gt; puzzles, for instance &#8212; once you cross the threshold of a specific puzzle (of knowing how it works), you know how it works; there&#8217;s no going back.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that certainly may influence your knowledge of when approaching any future puzzles of being able to recognize, “Oh I&#8217;ve seen this mechanic before”. But it&#8217;s not necessarily about iterating through a level and finding the best way to solve it, per se.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut: There&#8217;s sort of a “meta mastery” where you&#8217;re building up your skills &#8212; and “skills” not just in terms of recognizing mechanics, and having better-honed logical abilities &#8212; it&#8217;s also knowing your own behavior, the sort of psychological mastery of how you approach solving puzzles.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd… this actually gets to one of the properties of really broadly impactful puzzle design &#8212; that I somewhat rarely see but often happens accidentally &#8212; which is: Some of the best puzzles stay with you outside of the experience of solving the puzzle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd: It can also apply to yourself; it can apply to even just identifying the puzzles in the world around you. And, this actually relates back to what we were saying earlier about the difference between behavior of newer puzzle solvers versus more experienced solvers…  So, puzzles are about creating meaning from noise, from chaos. And through this, we really are telling a narrative; we are telling a cohesive story.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well I don&#8217;t know if it applies, but Loot and the derivatives that the community co-created &#8212; that&#8217;s a case where, there is like this sense of unfolding, but what&#8217;s really fascinating is undoing a lot of classic narrative construction. Because it is being created by the community, &lt;mhm&gt; and then they&#8217;re putting a lore around it. I think it&#8217;s something we see a lot more in crypto because of the decentralized nature of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s really interesting; you know there are memes that take on form in crypto, and the exact same thing happens in the puzzle community &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike, there&#8217;s a puzzle type that was invented where somebody came up with this puzzle format; and the original one I think was just called Duck Konundrum &#8212; That&#8217;s right, Matthew, right? Like, it was just called Duck Konundrum?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah by Dan Katz I believe, in a Mystery Hunt many years ago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. So they introduced this puzzle called &#8220;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fpuzzles.mit.edu\u002F2000\u002Fset5\u002F6\u002FPuzzle.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EDuck Konundrum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&#8220;, in which you get rules out of order, and you have to put them in order and then sort of step through all of them &#8212; It&#8217;s like getting a computer program in shards, and having to figure out you know the unique way in which the shards make coherent sense. And what&#8217;s fun about it is: lots of different sequences almost make sense. And then you get to the last one you&#8217;re like, Oh wait no I can&#8217;t- I now can&#8217;t use the last shard &#8212; like the n-minus-one shard has got me to a position that the last shard can&#8217;t act upon.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so you’re constantly trying to reorganize this thing in sort of like a meta-logic puzzle somehow. And this was so popular, that people started riffing off of this format, and now it&#8217;s called a “Duck Konundrum” &#8212; like you&#8217;ll open up a puzzle and be like ohmygosh, it&#8217;s another Duck Konundrum.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s kinda what happened, I think, with releasing bits of Loot. &lt;Scott: Totally!&gt; The community was like they&#8217;d come in at midnight and be like, &#8220;What does this mean,&#8221; and kinda try to figure it out together, you know.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And then these things sort of establish memes, within communities that then start crossing over across communities… And so you can introduce like a new central meme. Like some of Dom&#8217;s work, created a new way of designing an NFT project, that others then started building on, and reformatting, and remixing in different ways. That&#8217;s exactly what happens with puzzles as well. And Duck Konundrums are a perfect example of this…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou now even see ones where there are metareferences made to the duck &#8212; but you know it&#8217;s about alligators or something &#8212; but somehow there&#8217;s a duck that appears midway through the story, and you&#8217;re like wait oh I get it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. Puzzle hunts are deeply a community that constantly is riffing on their discoveries, and the way that they&#8217;re subverting expectations\u003Csup\u003E35\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E of solvers is by referencing previous things and then doing something slightly different.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd like we were saying before about how to welcome people to this community, it&#8217;s by being self-aware of how it&#8217;s so self-referential, and inviting people into the community &#8212; without expectations of needing to go so deeply &lt;Sonal: yes!&gt; but rather distilling the key experiential architecture, for people who people who don&#8217;t know or need all the context.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes exactly; it&#8217;s inclusion, not exclusion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScott:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMatthew:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, that’s a great note to end on; thank you both so much for joining this special bonus holiday-ish episode of “web3 with a16z”; we’ll resume our regular programming with the next episode.

There are, broadly speaking, two competing visions for how to bring this about: One is decentralized, generous with property rights and new frontiers, interoperable, open, and owned by the communities that build and maintain it. The other vision — too familiar to many people today — is centralized, closed, subject to the whims of corporations; and often extracts painful economic rents from its creators, contributors, and inhabitants.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe key dimension to compare these two visions is open vs closed, and the differences between them can be conceptualized as follows:\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5824\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FMetaverse-framework-In-line.jpe\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1254\" \u002F\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAn open metaverse is decentralized, allows users to control identity, enforces property rights, aligns incentives, and ensures value accrues to users (not platforms).

I&#8217;m Jon. I&#8217;m a general partner at a16z. Today we are talking about topics that I know are near and dear, and on everyone&#8217;s minds here at GDC, which are NFTs, Web3, and the impact in games. So, I&#8217;m honored to be joined by two luminaries in the Web3 games industry. Aleks Larsen, the cofounder and COO of Sky Mavis, which is behind Axie Infinity, and Gabby Dizon, the cofounder of Yield Guild Games.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet&#8217;s jump into it. Aleks and Gabby, we&#8217;ve heard a lot this past year about how NFTs and Web3 games are totally going to change the way people game, and the way the industry evolves. Let&#8217;s break it down into specifics. First, from a player perspective, what are some of the things that we can do today with NFTs or other Web3 primitives that were not possible before?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Speaking as a player from a developing country, the Philippines has always been one of the soft launch countries for games because there&#8217;s a lot of people who like to play who are very active on the social side. But people weren&#8217;t always able to receive real-world rewards for the time and skill they spent in-game. Now with NFTs in games, people can own their assets, and then participate in the game economy. So, that&#8217;s been huge for people from my country and other developing markets that have been able to participate in game economies, such as in Axie Infinity. It has allowed them to own digital assets that have their own value in the form of NFTs, like Axies or tokens. It&#8217;s just really changed the way people look at games. I think almost 2% of Filipinos play Axie Infinity, so it&#8217;s been a huge game-changer for the entire population.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think one of the things we see in Axie is higher engagement, retention, and that people actually care more about these assets more than they did in the past when they were leased by the game studios. When we&#8217;re looking at what an NFT actually is, it&#8217;s a part of your digital identity. So, I truly believe that part of why we made Axie and Sky Mavis is that we want people to own their own data. And when you&#8217;re starting your journey online, especially younger people, a lot of that is in games. Whenever you play a game, I firmly believe that you should have something that belongs to you. And this is represented by an NFT.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat has meaning for many people. And it&#8217;s not actually only about the monetary value. It&#8217;s about the emotional connection that people have to these game assets. That in the past, you used to just disappear if the games shut down. Now, at least you have some tangible proof that, &#8220;Hey, I actually did this in that game.&#8221; That has meaning. So, to me, that&#8217;s really important. And I think that was never really possible before, at least in the same way that we see now. So while the money is what draws people in, I believe that they will stay for everything else that&#8217;s surrounding these, and making them unique.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s very interesting that one of the first things that you mentioned was ownership. The concept that these are digital assets that no one can take away from you. If the game shuts down, if Axie Infinity closes tomorrow, your Axies would still be in your wallet. You can trade them and they have some intrinsic value. A common pushback that we get from Web2 developers, of which there are many in the audience today, is that digital ownership might just be a policy change that Web2 game developers could make for an existing game. For example, in World of Warcraft, they could just allow people to trade accounts with gold. In Diablo, there was a real money auction house for a time period, where people could buy and sell weapons and armors that they found in game. If you could take it one level deeper, what is it beyond just the ability to own and trade your digital items that is special about Web3 and NFTs?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It actually ties to what I said in terms of identity. Players are spending years grinding for game assets in games like World of Warcraft. The items they acquire have value to them, because of the time it took to get them, rather than y for the sales value. If they then quit the game but want to come back later to prove to someone that they did all these cool things it’s not certain they are there. The game developer could easily have deleted those game assets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. NFTs are digital property. It&#8217;s the digital analogue of owning a Magic card, or owning a baseball. You can play by different kinds of rules, or flavors of magic with Magic cards. You can also completely make up your own game around those assets. And the same thing goes with baseball. You can play it in a structured way with your friends, or you can play it in your backyard. Having NFTs transfers that concept of having digital ownership to the digital world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And from a developer&#8217;s perspective, if you are building games today, how should they be thinking about NFTs and exploring Web3? We&#8217;re seeing a massive flight of game developers moving from the Web2 world into Web3. What is it that&#8217;s motivating them? What&#8217;s exciting?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E We speak to a lot of game developers and they&#8217;re curious. “How did this innovation happen? What is the 2-token model? What is SLP?” Truth be told, a lot of it is just about experimentation, and trying to figure out what this new technology enables. For game developers coming into the space, they have to view tokens really, really carefully. And I emphasize to many entrepreneurs, especially those who are trying to raise money by selling tokens, just how important these tokens are. Because the liquidity that players immediately have, or investors immediately have, is something that you as a game studio or developer will have to defend over time.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nRather than selling NFTs, just as a light cash grab, it&#8217;s much better to actually reward early community members, and tie them into your community by giving them NFTs. And I think that actually flips the script. Because the moment that you&#8217;re selling something to a player, they feel like you owe them something. But the moment that you give something to a player, they feel like they almost owe you something in return. And that feeling of gratitude is insanely strong. And that&#8217;s how you can actually start building some very core communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E My take on the difference between Web2 to Web3 is that you really start with the assets as the base layer—the NFT is your base layer for IP, for intellectual property. Instead of thinking of the game, and then thinking of what assets you can put there, you actually think of what is the base asset itself? Let&#8217;s take Yuga Labs, for example. You have the Bored Ape, and then from there, you get airdropped Serum. And then you can create a second NFT, which is the Mutant. So, you&#8217;re actually creating your world one-by-one from those assets. And when you have that base asset, you can think, what does it mean to create a three-month game experience for my community, or a six-month game experience, or a two-year game experience? Maybe an MMO that takes five years to build. All using that same base layer of assets to reward your community, not only with different experiences, but also different assets that they can get from holding your base asset.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I find Yuga Labs and what they&#8217;re doing with ApeCoin to be really fascinating, because I think it&#8217;s a great example of bottom-up game building. They&#8217;ve basically given the community a set of primitives, the NFTs themselves, and told them, &#8220;Hey, we want to build a universe around this.&#8221; And then they&#8217;ve given commercial rights, in many cases, to the NFT holders. How do you reconcile that with the traditional model of game development? When you have a centralized game studio, an organization like Sky Mavis, which maintains a creative vision that&#8217;s balanced in the game, to make sure that things are fun to play, there are no cheaters, and so on, do you feel like these approaches are at odds? How do they reconcile?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The Sky Mavis approach is actually hybrid in a sense. When I&#8217;m looking at Yuga Labs, what are they doing? They&#8217;re giving away the commercial rights to use Apes in various things. Which is great–you can unlock creativity. As a game developer from the start, we are trying to progressively decentralize. At Axie, users can earn significant monetary value, but if they want to participate deeper in the ecosystem, they will need an agreement with us. We&#8217;re trying to make it so that the incentives are aligned with those who hold the underlying token, like the AXS, in our case. And the revenue that is generated, that either goes back to the players, or it gets put into our treasury, which then benefits the token holders.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nNow, for ApeCoin, I have stronger opinions about that because I&#8217;m not bullish on currency tokens. I believe that tokens need to have a clear way for people to collect some kind of value, whether that be money streams or to govern the platform. Just using them for trade or bartering is not really something that I believe will make the price go up, which is what a lot of this is actually about. I would rather focus on, especially if you&#8217;re issuing a token, why do people want to hold this? Make it so that people want to hold your asset for a long period of time, rather than just having it as a currency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s really difficult to build a game. But there&#8217;s a lot of things that NFTs and Web3 communities empower. One of my favorite examples is RTFKT and CloneX, which just started as a bunch of NFTs. But then they dropped another NFT, Space Pods, which is like a physical 3D space that people can decorate. A lot of people have actually entered as creators, and are decorating their own pods, and even learning Blender to do so. So, having your community feel like, &#8220;I am a real owner of this economy, and I can co-create with the developers.&#8221; And of course, you can set some boundaries there. There&#8217;s a core game experience that only the developer can create.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8230;. But if you can create a sandbox for the community to be really playful, and to have ownership, you&#8217;ll really see long-term loyalty that you won&#8217;t be able to see in any other kind of game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One of the challenges that we have today in Web3 is that there just aren&#8217;t that many players. To use a personal example, two nights ago I beat Elden Ring, which is a best-selling premium console game. They recently announced that 12 million people played Elden Ring last month. To the best of my knowledge though, there isn&#8217;t yet a blockchain game with 12 million players cumulative, let alone on a monthly active basis. What do you think needs to happen in order to have an Elden Ring level of success in blockchain gaming?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right now in Axie, we have about 1.6 million daily active players. And that is without having the game on any app stores. You can&#8217;t download the game on iOS. The only way to get it on Android is to have the APK downloaded directly. Having said that, what happens when we can reduce the barriers of entry even more? And it&#8217;s not about earning a whole lot of money as a developer, it&#8217;s about giving something back because forever gamers have been taken for granted, and actually exploited. They&#8217;re being squeezed to the max, especially by mobile game studios.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m a mobile game developer, by the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Speaking as a mobile game developer right now, we went down that path and figured out that it&#8217;s actually not the game developers who are the worst. It&#8217;s the middlemen. It&#8217;s the way that you have to spend money on ads. Now, what&#8217;s possible with blockchain games is that you can go to market directly to the consumer by dropping tokens, which is why Axie Infinity has been able to get so many users in such a short period of time. We went from 36,000 to now 2.5 million by the end of last year. By reducing the barriers even more, people are able to play for free but still experience the magic that&#8217;s surrounding Axie. That&#8217;s what it’ll take to get to those numbers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I represent how players are now engaging with gaming guilds, so I’ll talk about that. We started YGG on top of the Axie community. The community figured out that you could actually lend NFTs to other people without giving wallet access away, basically, by this kind of two-login system. If I gave you access to a username and password, without giving you access to my blockchain wallet, you could play the game, experience the game, and earn value without having to trust the person with your assets. So, we did that starting 2020 and now this has really blown up with Axie Infinity in the Philippines and other parts of the world. We are kind of set up as a player community, or run as a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) that is now purchasing assets of different kinds of games. We&#8217;ve bought assets in over 40 games now. Whether it&#8217;s a card game, or strategy, or RPG, we now have the assets for players to come in and enjoy these games, and earn it without having to buy an NFT to start. Of course, if they like it a lot, then they might buy something afterwards.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nWe&#8217;re seeing now that YGG has grown tremendously, a lot of it in developing areas such as Southeast Asia, India, Latin America, where people are playing these games and earning supplemental income. But I think we&#8217;re going to see an evolution similar to a World of Warcraft guild with a bank account. The guild itself may buy a castle or a kingdom, and it will produce buildings. And people will come in and harvest resources. The competitive people will be fighters that will be doing PvP against other people. So, having that kind of guild layer on top of digital assets gives you new gameplay primitives to play with that you&#8217;ve never seen before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Gabby, on the topic of DAOs, maybe just one contentious question… have DAOs today basically become web3 game publishers? If you&#8217;re working on a new Web3 game, you want YGG to take a look at the token design, to go through the game design docs and sign off on it. And that way, your community, your scholars and scholarship managers, will all know that this is a legitimate project and they should put their time and money behind it. Do you think there is a world where DAOs actually become too powerful in that perspective? Because they&#8217;ve actually become gatekeepers to future Web3 games and dApps in general, even outside of games. How do you think about that as you&#8217;re structuring your company and growing?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a really good question. I think the way to win and create value in Web3 is very different from how it was before. Before, if you had something proprietary, you wanted to gate it and charge for it, which is why Facebook and Google grew really big on top of their algorithms. In Web3, the way you grow is by compounding network effects, which means that if YGG comes in and helps a game launch, helps with a token design, and buys assets, we&#8217;re not going to gatekeep and not let other guilds in. We&#8217;re actually setting the design so that hundreds of other guilds can come in, enjoy the game, and have a thriving economy. We actually reduce the network effect, and therefore the value of what we&#8217;re doing, by gatekeeping. This is really the core difference in creating value between Web2 to Web3.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One final question for each of you, which is that there are a lot of Web2 developers in the audience who are crypto-curious, and want to learn more about Web3. What general advice would you have for them? How should they get started?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I would make sure that fundamentally the game that you&#8217;re designing is fun. That it can benefit from having an open or player-owned economy. And that the IP that you&#8217;re trying to create has the potential to grow outside of just being that one thing. So, truth be told, NFTs are primitives that can be used as building blocks.t. The experiences are unlimited, if you do it right. But you need to start somewhere, so I would say start from the fundamentals and go from there. Don&#8217;t get dragged into all of the hype around raising rounds before you&#8217;re ready.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Understanding the difference of the value of community in Web2 to Web3 is just so crucial to creating your game. Community has always been valuable in games, right? But in Web3, they can actually make or break your game. So, join a DAO, join the community, join a guild, and vote on some proposals. Or experience the game from the perspective of a DAO, which really gives you an idea of how powerful the network effects are of having digital assets that are owned by your player community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thank you, everyone, for joining us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FGDC-Event-1.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-310766\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FGDC-Event-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"665\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

I&#8217;m Jon. I&#8217;m a general partner at a16z. Today we are talking about topics that I know are near and dear, and on everyone&#8217;s minds here at GDC, which are NFTs, Web3, and the impact in games. So, I&#8217;m honored to be joined by two luminaries in the Web3 games industry. Aleks Larsen, the cofounder and COO of Sky Mavis, which is behind Axie Infinity, and Gabby Dizon, the cofounder of Yield Guild Games.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet&#8217;s jump into it. Aleks and Gabby, we&#8217;ve heard a lot this past year about how NFTs and Web3 games are totally going to change the way people game, and the way the industry evolves. Let&#8217;s break it down into specifics. First, from a player perspective, what are some of the things that we can do today with NFTs or other Web3 primitives that were not possible before?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Speaking as a player from a developing country, the Philippines has always been one of the soft launch countries for games because there&#8217;s a lot of people who like to play who are very active on the social side. But people weren&#8217;t always able to receive real-world rewards for the time and skill they spent in-game. Now with NFTs in games, people can own their assets, and then participate in the game economy. So, that&#8217;s been huge for people from my country and other developing markets that have been able to participate in game economies, such as in Axie Infinity. It has allowed them to own digital assets that have their own value in the form of NFTs, like Axies or tokens. It&#8217;s just really changed the way people look at games. I think almost 2% of Filipinos play Axie Infinity, so it&#8217;s been a huge game-changer for the entire population.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think one of the things we see in Axie is higher engagement, retention, and that people actually care more about these assets more than they did in the past when they were leased by the game studios. When we&#8217;re looking at what an NFT actually is, it&#8217;s a part of your digital identity. So, I truly believe that part of why we made Axie and Sky Mavis is that we want people to own their own data. And when you&#8217;re starting your journey online, especially younger people, a lot of that is in games. Whenever you play a game, I firmly believe that you should have something that belongs to you. And this is represented by an NFT.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat has meaning for many people. And it&#8217;s not actually only about the monetary value. It&#8217;s about the emotional connection that people have to these game assets. That in the past, you used to just disappear if the games shut down. Now, at least you have some tangible proof that, &#8220;Hey, I actually did this in that game.&#8221; That has meaning. So, to me, that&#8217;s really important. And I think that was never really possible before, at least in the same way that we see now. So while the money is what draws people in, I believe that they will stay for everything else that&#8217;s surrounding these, and making them unique.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s very interesting that one of the first things that you mentioned was ownership. The concept that these are digital assets that no one can take away from you. If the game shuts down, if Axie Infinity closes tomorrow, your Axies would still be in your wallet. You can trade them and they have some intrinsic value. A common pushback that we get from Web2 developers, of which there are many in the audience today, is that digital ownership might just be a policy change that Web2 game developers could make for an existing game. For example, in World of Warcraft, they could just allow people to trade accounts with gold. In Diablo, there was a real money auction house for a time period, where people could buy and sell weapons and armors that they found in game. If you could take it one level deeper, what is it beyond just the ability to own and trade your digital items that is special about Web3 and NFTs?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It actually ties to what I said in terms of identity. Players are spending years grinding for game assets in games like World of Warcraft. The items they acquire have value to them, because of the time it took to get them, rather than y for the sales value. If they then quit the game but want to come back later to prove to someone that they did all these cool things it’s not certain they are there. The game developer could easily have deleted those game assets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. NFTs are digital property. It&#8217;s the digital analogue of owning a Magic card, or owning a baseball. You can play by different kinds of rules, or flavors of magic with Magic cards. You can also completely make up your own game around those assets. And the same thing goes with baseball. You can play it in a structured way with your friends, or you can play it in your backyard. Having NFTs transfers that concept of having digital ownership to the digital world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And from a developer&#8217;s perspective, if you are building games today, how should they be thinking about NFTs and exploring Web3? We&#8217;re seeing a massive flight of game developers moving from the Web2 world into Web3. What is it that&#8217;s motivating them? What&#8217;s exciting?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E We speak to a lot of game developers and they&#8217;re curious. “How did this innovation happen? What is the 2-token model? What is SLP?” Truth be told, a lot of it is just about experimentation, and trying to figure out what this new technology enables. For game developers coming into the space, they have to view tokens really, really carefully. And I emphasize to many entrepreneurs, especially those who are trying to raise money by selling tokens, just how important these tokens are. Because the liquidity that players immediately have, or investors immediately have, is something that you as a game studio or developer will have to defend over time.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nRather than selling NFTs, just as a light cash grab, it&#8217;s much better to actually reward early community members, and tie them into your community by giving them NFTs. And I think that actually flips the script. Because the moment that you&#8217;re selling something to a player, they feel like you owe them something. But the moment that you give something to a player, they feel like they almost owe you something in return. And that feeling of gratitude is insanely strong. And that&#8217;s how you can actually start building some very core communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E My take on the difference between Web2 to Web3 is that you really start with the assets as the base layer—the NFT is your base layer for IP, for intellectual property. Instead of thinking of the game, and then thinking of what assets you can put there, you actually think of what is the base asset itself? Let&#8217;s take Yuga Labs, for example. You have the Bored Ape, and then from there, you get airdropped Serum. And then you can create a second NFT, which is the Mutant. So, you&#8217;re actually creating your world one-by-one from those assets. And when you have that base asset, you can think, what does it mean to create a three-month game experience for my community, or a six-month game experience, or a two-year game experience? Maybe an MMO that takes five years to build. All using that same base layer of assets to reward your community, not only with different experiences, but also different assets that they can get from holding your base asset.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I find Yuga Labs and what they&#8217;re doing with ApeCoin to be really fascinating, because I think it&#8217;s a great example of bottom-up game building. They&#8217;ve basically given the community a set of primitives, the NFTs themselves, and told them, &#8220;Hey, we want to build a universe around this.&#8221; And then they&#8217;ve given commercial rights, in many cases, to the NFT holders. How do you reconcile that with the traditional model of game development? When you have a centralized game studio, an organization like Sky Mavis, which maintains a creative vision that&#8217;s balanced in the game, to make sure that things are fun to play, there are no cheaters, and so on, do you feel like these approaches are at odds? How do they reconcile?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The Sky Mavis approach is actually hybrid in a sense. When I&#8217;m looking at Yuga Labs, what are they doing? They&#8217;re giving away the commercial rights to use Apes in various things. Which is great–you can unlock creativity. As a game developer from the start, we are trying to progressively decentralize. At Axie, users can earn significant monetary value, but if they want to participate deeper in the ecosystem, they will need an agreement with us. We&#8217;re trying to make it so that the incentives are aligned with those who hold the underlying token, like the AXS, in our case. And the revenue that is generated, that either goes back to the players, or it gets put into our treasury, which then benefits the token holders.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\nNow, for ApeCoin, I have stronger opinions about that because I&#8217;m not bullish on currency tokens. I believe that tokens need to have a clear way for people to collect some kind of value, whether that be money streams or to govern the platform. Just using them for trade or bartering is not really something that I believe will make the price go up, which is what a lot of this is actually about. I would rather focus on, especially if you&#8217;re issuing a token, why do people want to hold this? Make it so that people want to hold your asset for a long period of time, rather than just having it as a currency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s really difficult to build a game. But there&#8217;s a lot of things that NFTs and Web3 communities empower. One of my favorite examples is RTFKT and CloneX, which just started as a bunch of NFTs. But then they dropped another NFT, Space Pods, which is like a physical 3D space that people can decorate. A lot of people have actually entered as creators, and are decorating their own pods, and even learning Blender to do so. So, having your community feel like, &#8220;I am a real owner of this economy, and I can co-create with the developers.&#8221; And of course, you can set some boundaries there. There&#8217;s a core game experience that only the developer can create.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8230;. But if you can create a sandbox for the community to be really playful, and to have ownership, you&#8217;ll really see long-term loyalty that you won&#8217;t be able to see in any other kind of game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One of the challenges that we have today in Web3 is that there just aren&#8217;t that many players. To use a personal example, two nights ago I beat Elden Ring, which is a best-selling premium console game. They recently announced that 12 million people played Elden Ring last month. To the best of my knowledge though, there isn&#8217;t yet a blockchain game with 12 million players cumulative, let alone on a monthly active basis. What do you think needs to happen in order to have an Elden Ring level of success in blockchain gaming?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right now in Axie, we have about 1.6 million daily active players. And that is without having the game on any app stores. You can&#8217;t download the game on iOS. The only way to get it on Android is to have the APK downloaded directly. Having said that, what happens when we can reduce the barriers of entry even more? And it&#8217;s not about earning a whole lot of money as a developer, it&#8217;s about giving something back because forever gamers have been taken for granted, and actually exploited. They&#8217;re being squeezed to the max, especially by mobile game studios.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m a mobile game developer, by the way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Speaking as a mobile game developer right now, we went down that path and figured out that it&#8217;s actually not the game developers who are the worst. It&#8217;s the middlemen. It&#8217;s the way that you have to spend money on ads. Now, what&#8217;s possible with blockchain games is that you can go to market directly to the consumer by dropping tokens, which is why Axie Infinity has been able to get so many users in such a short period of time. We went from 36,000 to now 2.5 million by the end of last year. By reducing the barriers even more, people are able to play for free but still experience the magic that&#8217;s surrounding Axie. That&#8217;s what it’ll take to get to those numbers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I represent how players are now engaging with gaming guilds, so I’ll talk about that. We started YGG on top of the Axie community. The community figured out that you could actually lend NFTs to other people without giving wallet access away, basically, by this kind of two-login system. If I gave you access to a username and password, without giving you access to my blockchain wallet, you could play the game, experience the game, and earn value without having to trust the person with your assets. So, we did that starting 2020 and now this has really blown up with Axie Infinity in the Philippines and other parts of the world. We are kind of set up as a player community, or run as a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) that is now purchasing assets of different kinds of games. We&#8217;ve bought assets in over 40 games now. Whether it&#8217;s a card game, or strategy, or RPG, we now have the assets for players to come in and enjoy these games, and earn it without having to buy an NFT to start. Of course, if they like it a lot, then they might buy something afterwards.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re seeing now that YGG has grown tremendously, a lot of it in developing areas such as Southeast Asia, India, Latin America, where people are playing these games and earning supplemental income. But I think we&#8217;re going to see an evolution similar to a World of Warcraft guild with a bank account. The guild itself may buy a castle or a kingdom, and it will produce buildings. And people will come in and harvest resources. The competitive people will be fighters that will be doing PvP against other people. So, having that kind of guild layer on top of digital assets gives you new gameplay primitives to play with that you&#8217;ve never seen before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Gabby, on the topic of DAOs, maybe just one contentious question… have DAOs today basically become web3 game publishers? If you&#8217;re working on a new Web3 game, you want YGG to take a look at the token design, to go through the game design docs and sign off on it. And that way, your community, your scholars and scholarship managers, will all know that this is a legitimate project and they should put their time and money behind it. Do you think there is a world where DAOs actually become too powerful in that perspective? Because they&#8217;ve actually become gatekeepers to future Web3 games and dApps in general, even outside of games. How do you think about that as you&#8217;re structuring your company and growing?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a really good question. I think the way to win and create value in Web3 is very different from how it was before. Before, if you had something proprietary, you wanted to gate it and charge for it, which is why Facebook and Google grew really big on top of their algorithms. In Web3, the way you grow is by compounding network effects, which means that if YGG comes in and helps a game launch, helps with a token design, and buys assets, we&#8217;re not going to gatekeep and not let other guilds in. We&#8217;re actually setting the design so that hundreds of other guilds can come in, enjoy the game, and have a thriving economy. We actually reduce the network effect, and therefore the value of what we&#8217;re doing, by gatekeeping. This is really the core difference in creating value between Web2 to Web3.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One final question for each of you, which is that there are a lot of Web2 developers in the audience who are crypto-curious, and want to learn more about Web3. What general advice would you have for them? How should they get started?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #93ca15;\"\u003EAleks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I would make sure that fundamentally the game that you&#8217;re designing is fun. That it can benefit from having an open or player-owned economy. And that the IP that you&#8217;re trying to create has the potential to grow outside of just being that one thing. So, truth be told, NFTs are primitives that can be used as building blocks.t. The experiences are unlimited, if you do it right. But you need to start somewhere, so I would say start from the fundamentals and go from there. Don&#8217;t get dragged into all of the hype around raising rounds before you&#8217;re ready.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #5bc3f5;\"\u003EGabby:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Understanding the difference of the value of community in Web2 to Web3 is just so crucial to creating your game. Community has always been valuable in games, right? But in Web3, they can actually make or break your game. So, join a DAO, join the community, join a guild, and vote on some proposals. Or experience the game from the perspective of a DAO, which really gives you an idea of how powerful the network effects are of having digital assets that are owned by your player community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\"color: #ed8c00;\"\u003EJon:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thank you, everyone, for joining us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FGDC-Event-1.jpg\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-310766\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FGDC-Event-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"665\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

A new generation of products is reaching hundreds of millions of people, and molding an internet that frees users and creators from intrusive, extractive, centralized intermediaries. The most exciting example of this is the breakout success of Play-to-Earn (P2E) games, which allow game creators and players to share in the value generated when more people participate.  Historically, crypto has favored technical minds, and as a result appealed to a smaller user base –– but that’s changing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe’re seeing the creative floodgates in crypto gaming open up, as studios apply their talents to craft beautiful, compelling games that bring P2E concepts and playable NFTs to the mainstream.

In the transition from web2 to web3, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.mirror.xyz\u002FRoizwoGS7sh_5xG8rpDOlDyZnJStY6bxR9wSidf2ovU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ea similar trend\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is taking shape, but this time the opportunity for entrepreneurs is the exorbitant take rates imposed by the platforms that dominate web2. In web3, ownership and control is decentralized thanks to new innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This means that a new generation of internet services and products can be built so that the value of what is being created can be shared by the builders, creators, and users of the services directly with each other, rather than going to the platform middleman. This is rapidly changing the web as we know it, and nowhere is this more obvious and exciting than in gaming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECrypto gaming has been for years considered a niche experience designed for a very small group of early adopters. In theory, applying the values and ethos of the web3 space—reclaiming power and wealth from some of the platforms that have been historically extractive and distributing back to the people participating in these ecosystems—made a lot of sense for gaming. In practice, scalability challenges of the technology that impacted speed and costs, not to mention several difficult crypto cycles, made it nearly impossible to build a new kind of decentralized game that more people could participate in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to build a fun, engaging consumer experience, while also scaling infrastructure in a way that can support extraordinary growth, is extremely rare, and that’s what is so exceptional about the team at Sky Mavis. Their brainchild, Axie Infinity, has experienced breathtaking growth this year. Like so many who are building in crypto, the Sky Mavis team remained dedicated to their vision of bringing economic freedom to the world by making crypto fun, accessible, and empowering for everyday people, even through periods in which crypto was deeply unpopular. They also realized that in order to bring the game to millions of people they would need to develop technological solutions to support massive growth, and successfully developed the Ronin sidechain.  Historically, crypto has favored technical people, and onboarding experiences for non-technical people have often felt very intimidating. Axie Infinity introduced a new way for anyone to turn their time into money through Play-to-Earn (P2E), a mechanic that allows gamers to transform their skills and time into earnings and distribution rights for tokenized in-game items.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAxie Infinity is a digital pet universe and player-owned economy consisting of a breeding game, a battle game, and a land-based Clash of Clans style game. The game’s consistent, unifying thread is the Axie, an NFT character that is used across games and can be traded on secondary marketplaces. Players earn SLP tokens by winning battles in the Axie Infinity game, and they use a combination of SLP and the AXS governance token to breed new Axies. Thanks to the team’s persistence, hard work, innovation, and an unwavering commitment to their mission, Axie Infinity is now the fastest growing game in the world. As a result, Sky Mavis and Axie Infinity have catapulted P2E into the mainstream, and are completely redefining the gaming category in the process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Axie growth story is a phenomenal testament to the power of the P2E revolution that is resonating with so many people all around the world, beyond crypto native circles. Axie has grown to be the largest NFT gaming ecosystem and has amassed players around the world with more than 1.8 million daily active users logging into the platform in August. Axie Infinity has already achieved $33 million in daily transactions, for a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcryptoslam.io\u002Faxie-infinity\u002Fsales\u002Fsummary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etotal volume\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of over $2 billion. These numbers are even more impressive given Axie is not yet in the Apple or Google App Stores.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the web2 era of the internet, the financial upside of successful games did not go to the gamer, despite the fact that you could spend hours of your life building up your in-game persona, acquiring assets, creating worlds—at the end of the day you would have nothing to show for it other than the fact that you had a great time. What Axie Infinity has unlocked is the ability to play the games you love, have fun, but also participate in the financial upside of the community. This is an incredibly powerful idea: it means that games are no longer pure entertainment, but cross over into the realm of work. Axie Infinity is transforming communities around the world and replacing traditional forms of employment, changing people’s lives as players of the game help each other succeed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAxie embodies a new generation of games, where game creators are not operating from a place of fear but rather as an open, free market economy that allows players to move freely in and out of. The new model allows gamers to actually own aspects of the game and benefit from their contributions, as the game becomes more successful and more popular. Giving players freedom and ownership in a gaming experience drives immense loyalty, as Axie has proven. What this means for the future of games, and really the web as we know it, is as big as your imagination will allow.

I’m more intrigued by this emergent stage of where we are in the mainstreaming of crypto. The first non-DeFi consumer-facing dApps are beginning to scale, L1s and L2s are starting to take activity off of the Ethereum mainnet — but the very thing that’s a testament to the strength of Ethereum (its current price) may also become a chokepoint of engagement going forward.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEthereum, and crypto in general, isn’t able to lower prices at will — the cost of bootstrapping a network and incentivizing miners and stakers renders lower prices at the infrastructure layer a difficult task (such is the reality of being a decentralized network and not a multi-billion dollar telco company with an operating budget and the ability to use debt to fund capex). There are choices up-the-funnel, however, and developers have options about how to embed features that make interacting with crypto more accessible for the everyday user. I’m not suggesting that developers make things available for free (deploying a smart contract is expensive and time is irreplaceable). But where are the opportunities for more people to engage in crypto in a capacity that isn’t buying or flipping NFTs, using DeFi, or working for a DAO? And how will people learn the joy of collaboration and collective ownership over a network that has already priced them out?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be helpful to put this on a spectrum — where we are today, and what we might want to see more of in the future. On one end of the spectrum is participation through capital: This is what we saw in the emergent days of crypto networks, DeFi participation, and NFT trading. In the middle are developing forms of earning your place at the table — everything from earning DAO tokens through participation in a working group, to submitting proposals to a DAO for a specific job, to contributing to discussions on Discord, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Frabbithole.mirror.xyz\u002FZYcTE1mh5TxpGNHEPWon8KH7R3MlllJE4VhG_yJIr-M\"\u003Eto completing quests on Rabbithole\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, to play-to-earn games like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Faxieinfinity.com\u002F\"\u003EAxie Infinity\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

While it doesn’t seem like developers have adopted this standard, this is an optimistic sign of where the energy is headed. Between efforts to make on-chain, non-financial dApps more cost-effective, and exciting projects in accessible forms of games happening on other chains, it’s clear that there’s a desire to make crypto more tangible to the everyday user, along with the kind of grassroots coordination that can help make it happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n",8,"Minimum Viable Participation in Crypto - a16z crypto","https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fminimum-viable-participation-in-crypto-games-costs-accessibility\u002F","2021-08-19 00:00:00","\u003Cp\u003ELast year, when COVID swept into the Philippines, nearly 7.3 million people in the country lost their jobs and their livelihoods as the country went into lockdown. A rural province of Nueva Ecija, near Cabanatuan City, was particularly hard hit when the local economy came to a grinding halt. In response to the suffering, Gabby Dizon, a local gaming entrepreneur, began lending out his characters in a game called \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Faxieinfinity.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EAxie Infinity\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to different people in his community. These characters, called “Axies,” were used to earn tokens in the game that could be exchanged for local currency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new model, termed “play-to-earn,” marks a meaningful evolution in gaming economies. Soon, many players in the Philippines were earning more than they had at their previous jobs. Gaming was literally lifting an entire community out of poverty. Seeing the potential, Gabby, Beryl Li, and their third cofounder Owl of Moistness (who prefers to remain anonymous) created \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fyieldguild.io\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EYield Guild Games\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (YGG) as a way to involve more people in play-to-earn games.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere’s how it works: YGG players, called scholars, are lent in-game items that they use to earn tokens within a game. Scholars can cash out their tokens for local currencies, or eventually purchase the in-game items they were originally lent. This approach to decentralized gaming by YGG has ignited a paradigm shift that is upending conventional ideas related to work, play, and who has access to economic opportunities.

In order to scale its scholarship program, YGG introduced community managers — local leaders that help onboard new scholars and serve as their guide into crypto. Community managers receive a portion of scholars’ earnings for their services, and help scale YGG with a human touch. Their commitment to this community is at the heart of YGG’s phenomenal growth. For most scholars, crypto presents unparalleled economic opportunities and YGG will be the scholars’ trusted partner.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe’re thrilled to join this community as a partner and are excited to help establish NFT-based play-to-earn games as the next major innovation in gaming. That’s why today we are announcing a $4.6 million financing round in YGG, an investment that was finalized prior to the YGG token sale on July 27.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now there is a largely untapped economic opportunity in emerging markets to provide jobs by building a virtual economy in the digital world. The way we define a “job” is quickly evolving because of crypto and gaming, and we think we’re just starting to glimpse what’s possible in this realm. With 4,700+ scholars, and over $8.6 million earned, YGG is now paying out over $1 million weekly and already proving to be an unstoppable force for good. We couldn’t be more excited to work with Gabby, Beryl, Owl, and the rest of the team to bring YGG to an even wider community of scholars around the world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E###\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
