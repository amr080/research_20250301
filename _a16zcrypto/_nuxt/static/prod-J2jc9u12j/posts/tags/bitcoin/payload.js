At their peak, dominant nations dictate the rules of trade, finance, and military power, providing their currency with global credibility and trust.

Overextension — whether through war, costly expansions, or unsustainable social commitments — eventually erodes credibility. The Spanish Real de a Ocho, once backed by vast silver reserves from Latin America, declined as Spain’s mounting debts and economic mismanagement eroded its dominance. The Dutch guilder faded as relentless wars drained the Netherlands’ resources. The French franc, dominant in the 18th and early 19th centuries, weakened under the strain of revolution, Napoleonic wars, and financial mismanagement.

There is no smooth transition from dollar dominance to a Bitcoin-based system. Some argue that Bitcoin’s appreciation could help the United States “repay” its debt, but the reality would be far harsher. Such a shift would make it exponentially more difficult for the United States to finance its obligations and sustain its economic influence. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd while many dismiss the idea of Bitcoin ever becoming a true medium of exchange and unit of account, history suggests otherwise. Gold and silver weren’t just valuable because they were scarce, they were also divisible, durable, and portable, making them effective currencies — even without sovereign backing or issuance, much like Bitcoin today. Similarly, China’s early paper money didn’t begin as a government-imposed medium of exchange. It evolved from commercial promissory notes and deposit certificates — representations of already trusted stores of value — before gaining wider acceptance as a medium of exchange.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFiat currencies are often seen as an exception to this pattern — declared legal tender by the government, they function immediately as a medium of exchange and later as a store of value. But this oversimplifies reality. What gives fiat money its strength isn’t just legal decree, it’s the government’s ability to enforce taxation and its capacity to meet debt obligations through this power. A currency backed by a state with a strong tax base has intrinsic demand because businesses and individuals need it to settle obligations. This taxation power is what enables fiat currencies to retain value, even without a direct commodity backing.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut even fiat systems weren’t built from scratch. Historically, their credibility was bootstrapped from commodities people already trusted, most notably gold. Paper money gained acceptance precisely because it was once redeemable for gold or silver. The transition to pure fiat only became viable after decades of that trust being reinforced.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBitcoin is following a similar trajectory. Today, it is primarily seen as a store of value — volatile, yet increasingly regarded as digital gold. However, as adoption expands and financial infrastructure matures, its role as a medium of exchange will likely follow.

This is where Bitcoin plays a critical strategic role — serving as a bridge between the core USD platform and non-geopolitically aligned economies. In this context, Bitcoin could serve as a neutral network and asset that facilitates financial flows while reinforcing the U.S.’s central role in global finance, thereby preventing it from ceding ground to alternatives like the yuan. Even if it serves as a pressure release valve for nations seeking alternatives to dollar hegemony, Bitcoin’s decentralized, open nature ensures that it aligns more closely with U.S. economic and social values than with those of authoritarian regimes.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIf the U.S. successfully executes this strategy, it will become the epicenter of Bitcoin financial activity, giving it greater influence to shape those flows in line with U.S. interests and principles.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis is a delicate yet viable strategy that, if executed effectively, could extend the U.S. dollar’s relevance for decades.

However, while a tax can reduce crypto-mining in the US, it is far from obvious, from an economics perspective, that the other goals will follow. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EMining taxes can be popular amongst economists. Minerals are a pure gift from the land that no one who has been around for the last 100,000 years was responsible for. While it takes some effort to extract and then ship minerals, some great luck is involved in having the license to mine a particular tract of land. The economic term for the profits that flow from this is called \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Erent\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E.

All that changes is who gets the rent – the miner or the government – which makes the tax less popular amongst miners.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIt seems perhaps unfair to compare mineral mining to crypto mining, but the crypto community chose the name for a reason. In Proof of Work blockchains, what legitimizes nodes – which propose and confirm blocks of transactions at any given time – is that they have to demonstrate that they are there to behave well and not obstruct or attack the underlying network. Satoshi Nakamoto went to some considerable effort \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbitcoin.org\u002Fbitcoin.pdf\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Eto outline\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E what might constitute “work” for the Bitcoin blockchain and to design it in such a way that it could scale.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ENakamoto’s notion of work was imposed on everybody who wanted to be a node to help run the network – an entry fee if you will. To get the chance to confirm a block of new transactions, nodes would have to compete to solve a simple computational puzzle. The puzzle was meaningless – no one cared about the answer – but it was integrated neatly into the blockchain itself. To win this computational contest, miners had to find the answer before anyone else. While they couldn’t guarantee that outcome, the more resources – that is, compute – they applied to the problem, the more likely it was that they would win. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnd what did miners get for their trouble? Transaction fees paid by users, for starters. But, more significantly, they also received new bitcoins. Just how much they earned changed over time, but when bitcoins started to be worth some real money, the prize for ten minutes of computational effort became significant. They searched and dug (by offering resources and guessing puzzle answers), and then “extracted” (by receiving tokens if they solved it): mining. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ELike mineral mining, the total amount of resources (compute) devoted to Bitcoin mining was dictated by the value of the outcome. The more bitcoins were worth, the more intense the computational contest. If blocks were minted too quickly each one would process fewer transactions per reward. Thus, to keep mining to an average of 10 minutes per block confirmation, the difficulty of the computational puzzle would adjust. The more compute added to the contest, the more difficult it became, and vice versa.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EGiven that the contest to mine bitcoins is open to anyone with a computer worldwide, how did miners make money? After all, the outcome of the broader game was driven by free entry. If there were profits to be had, it would pay someone somewhere to devote a processor and their electricity bill to the contest. They wouldn’t win often, but on average, their winnings would cover their costs. Indeed, Nakamoto outlined in his whitepaper a more democratic process. But economically, expected profits would be low, and  not at the more predictable level of diamond mines. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EConsequently, the mining business became big, and miners formed pools to provide a more certain stream of income. The miners also became more sophisticated, evolving from a person with a computer in their basement to big data centers with thousands of specialized ASIC processors devoted to crypto mining. The electricity bill from those data centers grew. Electricity companies (and chip makers) weren’t complaining, though – any more than shovel makers did during the Gold Rush.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOne result is that, by some estimates, crypto mining was consuming as much electricity as a small country. And for what, skeptics (some might say cynics) asked? To play a computational game? For cryptocurrency that seemed to some like monopoly money or worse, casino chips? What did the rest of society get from this other than higher electricity bills and increased pollution locally and potentially globally? For the past decade or more, the crypto community – at least those focused on Proof of Work –  hasn’t really had a good answer to that question. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EYet, despite this, if you were to ask an economist, they would be hard-pressed to condemn crypto mining-based electricity consumption relative to any other electricity consumption. Yes, crypto mining might look like a waste of resources – and if there is one thing economists don’t like, it is wasted resources. Many critiqued Bitcoin, for instance, for using the electricity generated by a reasonably sized country like Sweden. But you know who else is using the electricity generated by a reasonably sized country like Sweden? Sweden. And economists don’t particularly seem to mind Sweden. The point being that people are actually paying for the crypto-mining electricity and seemingly of their own free will. Who are we to judge?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EApparently, many governments are happy to judge. Some, like China, have prohibited crypto mining altogether (albeit for reasons beyond environmental concerns). The Biden proposal, called the \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.whitehouse.gov\u002Fcea\u002Fwritten-materials\u002F2023\u002F05\u002F02\u002Fcost-of-cryptomining-dame-tax\u002F\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EDAME\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E (Digital Asset Mining Energy) excise tax, stops short of prohibition but would mark up US crypto miners’ electricity bills by a flat 30 percent. The goals are, ostensibly, to lower electricity prices and, although this seems contradictory, to reduce both local and carbon pollution. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe tax  is not expected to be a big revenue generator – just a few billion over the next decade – because mining electricity bills aren’t actually that large; and also, crypto mining is globally competitive. Raise costs by that much and, unlike minerals, crypto miners can relocate to anywhere with an internet or satellite connection. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ETherein lies the issue. If the goal were to reduce what was regarded as sinful waste (in the same way one might tax tobacco to reduce health problems), it is unlikely to happen at a global level. Crypto mining exists in the U.S. because it is cheaper to mine there than anywhere else on the planet. If the tax causes some of those mines to shut down and others to open elsewhere, there would be more, not less, waste produced. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut it is even worse than that. It is far from obvious how this change will actually reduce global pollution. Reducing local pollution in the U.S. may be possible, but that pollution will follow the miners somewhere else, so this is what we would call a “beggar-my-neighbour” outcome. As the name suggests, it’s kind of selfish. Moreover, the U.S. government&#8217;s massive climate policy that passed last year involved billions of dollars of investment in renewables and innovations to make energy production less climate-damaging.
