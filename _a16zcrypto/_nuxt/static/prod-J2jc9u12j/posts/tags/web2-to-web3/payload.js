This is no longer the case: networks controlled by the largest tech companies now reach billions, but entrepreneurs and creators have learned just how untrustworthy they can be. These businesses clamp down on application programming interfaces, meddle with mysterious algorithms, and rank content according to opaque and capricious policies. Worse, big tech companies claim most of the revenue that flows through their networks. This stifles creativity, making our online lives poorer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the economics of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Ftags\u002Fnetwork-effects\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enetwork effects\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: companies provide perks and easy-to-use tools to draw in users — and then, once they are locked in, switch to extracting value from them.

First, openness: being available to anyone, anywhere. Second, trust: the rules should be transparent, fair and dependable, so builders, creators and users know the network cannot yank the rug out from under them. Finally, all users — not just centralized gatekeepers — should have a say in the networks they contribute to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworks built on blockchains have all these attributes. While it’s easy to dismiss the technology because of its associations with casino-style gambling behavior — notably FTX and meme coins — it would be a mistake to ignore its potential.

This could potentially revolutionize the internet’s power dynamics.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworks built on blockchains combine the societal benefits of early internet protocol networks (open access, democratic governance, low take rates and user ownership rights) with the competitive advantages of corporate ones (sustainable sources of funding and advanced features).

note: This is an adapted excerpt from the just-released book \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Freadwriteown.com\u002F#order\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ERead Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by Chris Dixon. The book is now available in the U.S. and in the U.K. for English-language editions; more editions in other languages coming soon. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is probably the most important invention of the twentieth century. It transformed the world much as earlier technological revolutions &#8212; the printing press, the steam engine, electricity &#8212; did before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike many other inventions, the internet wasn’t immediately monetized. Its early architects created the network not as a centralized organization but as an open platform that anyone &#8212; artists, users, developers, companies, and others &#8212; could access equally. At a relatively low cost and without needing approval, anyone anywhere could create and share code, art, writing, music, games, websites, startups, or whatever else people could dream up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd whatever you created, you owned. As long as you obeyed the law, no one could change the rules on you, extract more money from you, or take away what you built. The internet was designed to be permissionless and democratically governed, as were its original networks: email and the web. No participants would be privileged over others. Anyone could build on top of these networks and control their creative and economic destinies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis freedom and sense of ownership led to a golden period of creativity and innovation that drove the growth of the internet, leading to countless applications that have transformed our world and the way we live, work, and play.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen, everything changed. Starting in the mid-2000s, a small group of companies wrenched control away. The internet got intermediated. The network went from permissionless to permissioned.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good news: Billions of people got access to amazing technologies, many of which were free to use. The bad news: A centralized internet run by a handful of mostly ad-based services meant people had fewer software choices, weakened data privacy, and diminished control over their online lives. It also became much harder for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presences without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them and taking away their audiences, profits, and power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though those platforms deliver significant value to people, they also control what we see and watch. The most visible example of this is deplatforming &#8212; where services eject people, usually without transparent due process. Alternatively, people may get silenced and not even know it &#8212; a practice called shadowbanning. Search and social ranking algorithms can change lives, make or break businesses, and even influence elections.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA subtler and equally troubling point is how these centralized networks restrict and constrain startups, impose high rents on creators, and disenfranchise users. The negative effects of their design choices stifle innovation, tax creativity, and concentrate power and money in the hands of a few.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially dangerous when you consider that the killer app of the internet \u003Cem\u003Eis \u003C\u002Fem\u003Enetworks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of what people do online involves networks: The web and email are networks. Social apps are networks. Payment apps are networks. Marketplaces are networks. Almost every useful online service is a network. Networks &#8212; computing networks, of course; but also developer platforms, marketplaces, financial networks, social networks, and all variety of communities coming together online &#8212; have always been a powerful part of the promise of the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers, entrepreneurs, and everyday internet users have nurtured and nourished tens of thousands of networks, unleashing an unprecedented wave of creation and coordination. Yet the networks that have lasted are mostly owned and controlled by private companies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem stems from \u003Cem\u003Epermission\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Today creators and startups need to ask for permission from centralized gatekeepers and incumbents to launch and grow new products. But dominant tech businesses leverage the power of permission to thwart competition, desolate markets, and extract rents. And those rents are exorbitant: App stores charge up to 30 percent for payments. That’s more than ten times the payment industry norm. Such steep take rates are unheard of in other markets, and they reflect how powerful these companies have become. That’s what we mean when we say corporate networks tax creativity. The taxation is literal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese big, centralized networks are ruthless, anticompetitive, and abuse their power. They squelch competitors, reducing options for consumers. By cutting off third parties that were building apps for users on top of their platforms, they punished many developers &#8212; and therefore punished users by offering fewer products, fewer choices, and less freedom. Today almost no new startup activity takes place on top of social networks. Developers know better than to lay foundations on quicksand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany people don’t see a problem with the way things are, are happy with the status quo, or don’t think much about it. They are satisfied with the comforts afforded by these centralized platforms and networks. We live in an age of abundance, after all. You can connect to anyone you want (assuming the corporate owners are okay with it). You can read, watch, and share as much as you like. There are plenty of “free” services to satiate us &#8212; the price of entry being just our data. (As they say, “If it’s free, then you’re the product.”)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you think the tradeoff is worth it &#8212; or perhaps you see no other viable alternative for life online. Either way, whatever your stance, one trend is undeniable: centralizing forces are drawing the internet inward, collecting power into the center of what was supposed to be a decentralized network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inward turn of the internet is stifling innovation, making it less interesting, less dynamic, and less fair.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo the extent that anyone recognizes a problem, they usually assume the only way to rein in existing giants is through government regulation. That may be part of the solution. But regulation often has the unintended side effect of cementing existing giants’ power. Larger companies can deal with compliance costs and regulatory complexity that overwhelm smaller upstarts, while red tape restrains newcomers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need a level playing field. And in service of that, we need thoughtful regulation that respects this fundamental truth: startups and technologies offer a more effective way to check incumbents’ power. Moreover, knee-jerk regulatory responses ignore what sets the internet apart from other technologies. Many of the usual calls for regulation assume that the internet is similar to past communications networks, like telephone and cable TV networks. But these older, hardware-based networks are different from the internet, a software-based network. The internet depends, of course, on physical infrastructure owned by telecom providers. But it is the code running at the network edges &#8212; on PCs, phones, and servers &#8212; that drives the behavior of internet services. This code can be upgraded. With the right set of features and incentives, new software can propagate across the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to its malleable nature, the internet can be reshaped through innovation and market forces. Software is special because it has a nearly unbounded range of expressiveness. Almost anything you can imagine can be encoded in software; software is the encoding of human thought, just like writing or painting or cave drawings. Computers take those encoded thoughts and run them at lightning speeds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why Steve Jobs once described the computer as “a bicycle for the mind.” It accelerates our abilities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware is so expressive that it is better thought of not as engineering, but as an art form. The plasticity and flexibility of code offer an immensely rich design space, far closer in the breadth of possibilities to creative activities like sculpting and fiction writing than engineering activities like bridge building. As with other art forms, practitioners regularly develop new genres and movements that fundamentally shift what’s possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s what’s happening today. Just as the internet seemed to be consolidating beyond repair, a new software movement emerged that can reimagine the internet. The movement has the potential to bring back the spirit of the early internet; secure property rights for creators; reclaim user ownership and control; and break the stranglehold big, centralized companies have on our lives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere’s a better way, and these are still the early days. The internet can still fulfill the promise of its original vision. Entrepreneurs, technologists, creators, and users can make it happen. The dream of an open network that fosters creativity and entrepreneurship doesn’t have to die.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the beginning, not the end, of internet innovation. There’s an urgency to that conviction, though: the United States is already losing its lead in this new movement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERead Write Own: A new movement \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo understand how we got here, it helps to be familiar with the broad strokes of internet history: The first thing to know is that power on the internet derives from how \u003Cem\u003Enetworks\u003C\u002Fem\u003E are designed. Network design &#8212; the way nodes connect, interact, and form an overarching structure &#8212; might seem like an arcane technical topic, but it is the single most relevant factor in determining how rights and money are distributed across the internet. Even small initial design decisions can have profound downstream consequences on the control and economics of internet services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, network design determines outcomes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil recently, networks came in two competing types:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E&#8220;Protocol networks”, like email and the web, are open systems controlled by communities of software developers and other network stakeholders. These networks are egalitarian, democratic, and permissionless: open to anyone and free to access. In these systems, money and power tend to flow to the network edges, incentivizing systems to grow around them.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E“Corporate networks” are networks that companies, instead of communities, own and control. These are like walled gardens with one groundskeeper; they’re theme parks controlled by a single megacorp. Corporate networks run centralized, permissioned services that allow them to quickly develop advanced features, attract investment, and accrue profits to reinvest in growth. In these systems, money and power flow to the network center, to companies that own the networks, and away from users and developers at the network edges.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI see the history of the internet as unfolding in three acts, each marked by a predominating network architecture:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIn the first act, the “read era” (circa 1990-2005) early internet protocol networks democratized information. Anyone could type a few words into a web browser and read about almost any topic through websites.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIn the second act, the “read-write era” (roughly 2006-2020), corporate networks democratized publishing. Anyone could write and publish to mass audiences through posts on social networks and other services.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENow a new type of architecture is enabling the internet’s third act. This architecture represents a natural synthesis of the two prior types, and it is \u003Cem\u003Edemocratizing ownership. \u003C\u002Fem\u003EIn the dawning “read-write-own era,” anyone can become a network stakeholder &#8212; gaining power and economic upside previously enjoyed by only a small number of corporate affiliates, like stockholders and employees.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new era promises to counteract big company consolidation and return the internet to its dynamic roots.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople can read and write on the internet, but they can also now \u003Cem\u003Eown. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Blockchains” and “blockchain networks” are the technologies driving the movement. This new movement goes by a few names. Some people call it “crypto,” since the foundation of its technology is cryptography. Others call it “web3,” implying that it is leading to a third era of the internet. Whichever name you prefer, the core technology of blockchains presents unique advantages. Blockchain networks are the most credible and civic-minded force to counterbalance internet consolidation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may still be wondering, but so what? What problems do blockchains solve?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome people will tell you that blockchains are a new type of database, one that multiple parties can edit, share, and trust. A better description is that blockchains are a new class of computer, but one you can’t put in your pocket or on your desk, as you might with a smartphone or laptop. They do store information, and run rules encoded in software that can manipulate that information.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the significance of blockchains lies in the unique way that they &#8212; and the networks built on top of them &#8212; are \u003Cem\u003Econtrolled\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith traditional computers, the hardware controls the software. Hardware exists in the physical world, where an individual or organization owns and controls it. That means that, ultimately, a person or group of people is in charge of both the hardware and the software. People can change their minds, and therefore the software they control, at any time. Blockchains invert the hardware-software power relationship, like the internet before them. With blockchains, the software governs a network of hardware devices. The software &#8212; in all its expressive glory &#8212; is in charge.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does this all matter? Because blockchains are computers that can, for the first time ever, establish inviolable rules in software. This allows blockchains to make strong, software-enforced commitments to users. A pivotal commitment involves digital ownership, which places economic and governance power in the hands of users. The ability for blockchains to make strong commitments about how they will behave in the future allows \u003Cem\u003Enew networks \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eto be created.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchain networks therefore solve problems that earlier network architectures can’t solve:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey can connect people in social networks while empowering users over corporate interests.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey can underpin marketplaces and payment networks that facilitate commerce, but with persistently lower take rates.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey can enable new forms of monetizable media, and interoperable and immersive digital worlds.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey allow artificial intelligence products to \u003Cem\u003Ecompensate\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; rather than \u003Cem\u003Ecannibalize\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; creators.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, blockchains create networks, but unlike other network architectures &#8212; and here’s the key point &#8212; they have more desirable outcomes: Blockchain networks combine the societal benefits of protocol networks with the competitive advantages of corporate networks. Software developers get open access, creators get direct relationships with their audiences, fees are guaranteed to stay low, and users get valuable economic and governance rights. At the same time, blockchain networks have the technical and financial capabilities to compete with corporate networks. Blockchains therefore can:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eincentivize innovation\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ereduce taxes on creators\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Elet network contributors share in decision making and upside\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAsking “What problems do blockchains solve?” is like asking “What problems does steel solve over, say, wood?” Blockchain networks are a new construction material for building a better internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe ‘casino vs. the computer’\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENew technologies are often controversial, and blockchains are no exception. Many people associate blockchains with scams and get-rich-quick schemes. There is some truth to these claims, as there was truth to similar claims about tech-driven financial manias of the past &#8212; from the railroad boom of the 1830s to the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. The public discussion mostly focused on IPOs and stock prices, but there were also entrepreneurs and technologists who looked beyond the ups and downs, rolled up their sleeves, and built products and services that eventually delivered on the hype.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were speculators, but there were also builders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, the same cultural divide exists around blockchains:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOne group &#8212; “the casino” &#8212; is often the much louder of the two, and it is primarily interested in trading and speculation. At its worst, this culture of gambling has led to catastrophes like the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX. This group gets most of the media attention, which influences the public image for the entire category.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe other group &#8212; “the computer” &#8212; is the far more serious of the two, and it is motivated by a long-term vision. This group’s practitioners understand that the financial aspects of blockchains are only a means to an end, a way to align incentives toward a larger goal. They realize the real potential in using blockchains is to build better networks, and therefore a better internet. These people are quieter and don’t get as much attention, but they are the ones who will have lasting effects.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn’t to say the computer culture isn’t interested in making money. We’re a venture capital firm. Most of the tech industry is profit-driven. The difference is that real innovation takes time to generate financial returns. That’s why most venture capital funds (ours included) are structured with purposefully long hold periods. Producing valuable new technologies can take up to a decade and sometimes longer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComputer culture is long term. Casino culture is not.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, it’s the computer versus the casino battling it out to define the narrative for this software movement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, optimism and cynicism can both be taken too far. The dot-com bubble, followed by bust, reminded many people of that. The way to see the truth is to separate the essence of a technology from specific uses and misuses of it. A hammer can build a home, or it can demolish one. All technologies have the capacity to help or harm; blockchains are no different. The question is, how can we maximize the good while minimizing the bad?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe decisions we make now will determine the internet’s future: who builds, owns, and uses it; where innovation happens; and what the experience will be for everyone.

ways, but we like to describe them simply as \u003Cem\u003Edigital records that have a uniquely defined owner\u003C\u002Fem\u003E… sort of like digital deeds. These records are often associated with\u003Cem\u003E \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eother assets — whether digital (like images and game items) or physical (like clothing or art), or both. And just as \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fseven-types-of-nfts\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ewebsites\u003C\u002Fa\u003E did in the early days of the web, NFTs open up an endless range of applications because they have many uses and features. As more people begin figuring out these applications, we thought we’d share 5 ways different groups are already using NFTs:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor everyday consumers: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003EHave you ever tried to buy a sold-out concert ticket, and worried that the seller could have sold the exact same ticket code to someone else? Or ever wished you could move your x-rays to a new dentist more easily? NFTs solve these and other needs by turning such data into a digital asset that’s maintained in an account you uniquely own. If you wanted to move your NFT medical records, you could simply redirect access to a new provider — in the same way you might carry a sheaf of documents from one doctor’s office to another. Similarly, an NFT ticket can only be owned by one person at a time, bought and sold just like a physical good. And while some NFTs are transferable, others are non-transferable — tied to a specific account, just like a driver’s license is tied only to a specific individual. These features open up many use cases — from new kinds of loyalty programs to new kinds of experiences bridging the digital and the physical.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E…As for gamers and other power consumers: You probably collect digital assets in games like Roblox or Fortnite, or have a bunch of digital music files. Because NFT music files aren’t locked in Amazon or iTunes, and are held in an account that you control, you can connect into whatever platform you like. So NFTs allow you to use the digital stuff you “own” across different web platforms, while at the same time giving you \u003Cem\u003Etrue\u003C\u002Fem\u003E ownership. Furthermore, the content and reputation\u002F karma points you build on social media can be shared everywhere simultaneously, rather than just on a single platform. For instance, if you’re a top poster on Reddit, you would be able to carry that reputation over to TikTok and vice versa — essentially building a sovereign digital identity across the web that’s not held captive by any platform.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor a big brand, sports team, or local business: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003ENFTs provide a new way to identify and reward your fans — reinforcing brand attachment, loyalty, and identity. There’s a powerful feedback loop in giving people branded digital assets that they truly own, to then building value on top of those assets and incorporating them into user identities, and continually building organic communities around a brand. Many brands have turned their fans into \u003Cem\u003Esuperfans\u003C\u002Fem\u003E who become even more active and engaged than before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor an artist, musician, or other creator:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E It’s not a coincidence that a lot of NFT technology has been used in the art market; this is where NFTs first hit the mainstream a few years ago when traditional auction houses began embracing them in high-profile auctions. The novel feature of NFTs here is that they provide a broadly accessible way of defining a unique owner of a digital asset or media file; previously, this would have required a dealer, gallery, or other intermediary in between. Since an NFT serves as a digital “deed” with ownership tracked on a public ledger, these records make it possible for anyone to identify and verify who owns what — including provenance, history of ownership, and transfer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMore importantly for creators: NFTs help you “own” your audience — there’s no gallery, agency, record label, or web platform standing between you and your collectors\u002F followers. NFTs can also help creators get access to royalties across both primary \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C\u002Fem\u003E secondary sales. But some of the more interesting uses around NFTs for creators involve communities discovering and finding each other directly around the creator’s works. Since NFTs are digitally native, you can identify and interact with those communities globally. It’s also possible to wrap NFTs with further software functionality: For example, some web3-native media platforms offer a form of “verified display”, where the platform reads the NFT (whether art or music or whatever) to verify ownership — and then enables the owner of a work to showcase it, share its ownership with others, remix it, and do much more.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor a crypto skeptic:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E You may have heard of NFTs, for better or for worse — but when you look past the noise, most of the use cases have been useful, not just speculative. We’re already seeing \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fspotlight-on-crypto-policy\u002F\" rel=\"\"\u003Eestablished brands\u003C\u002Fa\u003E including Mattel, Nike, Starbucks, and others building sophisticated products around NFTs with growing mass-market traction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of NFTs as a broad, general-purpose technology for establishing \u003Cem\u003Eproperty rights\u003C\u002Fem\u003E in digital space, independently of any specific platform. Such property rights are the fundamental foundation of successful markets. So when faced with a new, general-purpose technology like NFTs, my advice to my students at Harvard Business School is to learn about the technology and its potential, even if that learning only reinforces your skepticism… Because it’s far better to develop an informed opinion than to be caught flat-footed when a particular technology changes business, culture, and society.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor the crypto-familiar:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003ENFTs leverage blockchain networks to establish a robust, decentralized form of ownership of digital goods. Each NFT is controlled by the wallet identified on-chain as its owner, and exists independently of whoever created it. Moreover, an NFT on a public blockchain inherently establishes and surfaces a network of affiliation among everyone who holds it — which can serve as a foundation for community co-creation. As we describe in \u003Cem\u003EThe Everything Token\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, there’s an art to (and plenty of frameworks for!) building value around these assets, tracing the path from ownership to utility to identity and community — and we’re excited that you’re a part of this journey.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESteve Kaczynski and Scott Duke Kominers are the authors of the just-released book \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"ttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.penguinrandomhouse.com\u002Fbooks\u002F723505\u002Fthe-everything-token-by-steve-kaczynski-and-scott-duke-kominers\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EThe Everything Token: How NFTs and Web3 Will Transform the Way We Buy, Sell, and Create\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (Portfolio, January 23).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Simultaneously, the startup pitches Cohort B the same offering at 5X for Good, 5Y for Better, and 5Z for Best. In this example, Cohort B&#8217;s pricing is literally five times higher than that of Cohort A. What the startup should observe, in this case, is the variation in win rate between the two cohorts. If four out of five prospects in Cohort B still sign up for the service, this suggests that the pricing shown to Cohort A undervalues the offering. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EYou might be surprised by how much people are willing to dish out on your product or service!\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAnother consideration is the denomination of your pricing.

Instagram trying to hide the number of people who liked a post, TikTok downplaying the follower count.

One common way to blow up your social network is to take a hitherto scarce or hard to attain status signal and make it widespread overnight without thinking through the downstream implications. In a lot of these cases, you either blow up the network or cause people to figure out status through other means you didn’t intend.How is this connected to high inequality? You often see networks try and do this to battle inequality and wind up creating worse problems by devaluing a key reward mechanism.

While originally intended to mean “This person is actually X who they claim to be”,  a measure intended to battle impersonation, all networks originally rolled it out to only “notable people” (read: famous in some way) who might need it. \u003Ci\u003EOops!\u003C\u002Fi\u003E Thus leading to its broad understanding as one of “This person is someone notable in the world”, something every network tries to battle to this day.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECompounding status inequality:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E One very common pitfall for naive implementations of discovery, ranking or status is to inadvertently stop newcomers from “breaking in”.Any social experience will typically have attention or display mechanisms that need to take relative status into account. A naive implementation of a “suggestions” feed or a “top users” might be to rank content based on follower count – ensuring that people with large follower counts get more views and people new to the platform never feel discovered. Very often, such naive implementations cause compounding inequality and make it impossible for newcomers to climb the status ladder.Very often, such naive implementations cause compounding inequality and make it impossible for newcomers to climb the status ladder.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest mistake you can make – as astutely \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.eugenewei.com\u002Fblog\u002F2019\u002F2\u002F19\u002Fstatus-as-a-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epointed out\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by Eugene Wei – is to not acknowledge how social networks have social capital at their core.

There were mobile devices that could access the open web but they were extremely niche (I was an avid \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=rMNDqO2HjEU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ESidekick\u003C\u002Fa\u003E user).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne striking thing about that period was the contrast between what smart founders and engineers talked about at dinner and on weekends and what the mainstream tech world took seriously during work days. For example, one popular mainstream trend was enterprise security appliances, which were basically servers preloaded with security software. Many of the very same people would go to work and talk about the “serious” products, and then go to dinner, or hang out on the weekends, and talk about consumer internet products and web 2. It was the most interesting thing happening in tech. But generally, the view was, web 2 products were toys that couldn&#8217;t be real businesses. They were hobbies, and not something you would take seriously during the workday.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne lesson for me, which took me some time to learn, and that eventually led to some blog posts I wrote, including “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2010\u002F01\u002F03\u002Fthe-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EThe next thing big thing will start out looking like a toy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” and “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2013\u002F03\u002F02\u002Fwhat-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EWhat the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years\u003C\u002Fa\u003E,” is that there&#8217;s a strong correlation between rich product design spaces and what smart people find interesting. Web 2 was captivating, and led to so many dinner and weekend conversations, because there were so many novel product design possibilities. What if you took this feature and that feature and combined them? What if you applied this design pattern to a different context? What original product concepts would be invented next? This is what got people so excited. In contrast, the “serious stuff,” security appliances and such, seemed much more limited in their possibilities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother striking thing about that period was how small and passionate the web 2 community was. I remember in 2004 going to what I think might have been the first New York Tech meetup. The whole group fit in a small room in Meetup’s headquarters. People demoed software they had created and talked late into the evening. I still have friends from that period. Sometimes I get asked how I first met old friends like Fred Wilson and Alexis Ohanian. The simple answer is there just weren&#8217;t that many people, especially on the east coast, who were interested in these topics. We all knew each other. It was a real community. I have one old friend Alex Rampell (who now works with me at a16z) who I met in 2003 because a friend of mine was at a dinner party and afterwards said “Hey, I met someone else who&#8217;s interested in consumer internet.” It was that rare. But people were very focused and excited. The feeling was that a revolution was brewing. We knew a secret and the rest of the world hadn&#8217;t figured it out yet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for me, I was working on my own web 2 startup called SiteAdvisor. Around 2003, when my co-founders and I started developing the concept, web security threats were spiraling out of control. Most people used PCs with Internet Explorer, and problems like phishing and spyware were widespread. The idea for SiteAdvisor was that we’d start off with a tool that would warn users about security threats like phishing and spyware, and then, over time, applying web 2 concepts like user-generated reviews, layer on more subjective judgements (similar to what \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.trustpilot.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ETrustPilot\u003C\u002Fa\u003E seems to do today). This staged approach was common at the time, a strategy I later characterized as “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2015\u002F01\u002F31\u002Fcome-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ECome for the tool, stay for the network\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.” We built APIs and encouraged mashups and did most of our marketing through SEO.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E2005 was a big year for web 2 because of two acquisitions, Flickr and Delicious, both by Yahoo. The dollar values were small by today’s standards, something like $30M each, but it was an important signal. The assumption up until then was that web 2 was a fun hobby, a way to build cool stuff, but not something that would produce real businesses. Yahoo was considered a savvy company, and said they were making web 2 a core part of their strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I recall, that was the point when web 2 started transitioning from a niche cult movement into mainstream tech. Some of the early web 2 founders successfully made the transition. In other cases new entrepreneurs came along who built on the work of the early enthusiasts. The basis of competition switched from creative idea generation to disciplined execution. You had to decide whether you wanted to be the idealistic band at the indy bar or be pragmatic — potentially making compromises — and play in stadiums.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy 2007, things were looking up for web 2. Among other things, Facebook passed 10M users, Twitter was growing and had just gotten VC funded, and Google acquired YouTube. Then the 2008 financial crisis hit, which was a gut check for entrepreneurs. Tech funding dried up, and a lot of smart people said we were on the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Farticles.sequoiacap.com\u002Frip-good-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Everge\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of another great depression.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe financial downturn was a difficult time for many people. But from a startup perspective, the 2008-11 era turned out to be a golden age. Apple released the iPhone app store in 2008 and by 2009 talented founders were pouring in. The mobile app revolution was in full swing. Almost all of today’s top mobile apps were created by companies founded between 2009 and 2011, including Uber, Venmo, Snap, and Instagram. In retrospect, there was a convergence of three powerful trends: social media (by then that word was replacing web 2), cloud computing (which would enable the apps to scale server side), and the rise of smartphones. Independent product design spaces are multiplicative: even if social, cloud, and mobile each improved linearly, the combination could improve exponentially.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI made the chart below to summarize how I&#8217;ve come to think about product and financial cycles. The key idea is that product and financial cycles evolve mostly independently. The top of the chart shows the Nasdaq index as a rough proxy for financial sentiment. Financial sentiment fluctuates unpredictably and sometimes wildly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next row shows the years that iconic startups or products were created. The timing is mostly dictated by product cycles, which are shown in the bottom row. Product cycles follow their own internal logic and tend to be more predictable than financial cycles. They begin with the incubation phase when enthusiasts explore ideas on nights and weekends and build products that are mostly used by other enthusiasts. The growth phase arrives when the right mix of technology, talent, and community knowledge comes together to enable the products to go mainstream. (I show the biggest tech cycles in the chart, but smaller, offshoot tech cycles happen as well, including web 2 in the 2000s, and things like fintech and SaaS in the 2010s.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\n\u003Cfigure class=\"rehype-figure\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv data-rmiz-wrap=\"visible\"\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" \u002F\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-6329 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2023\u002F02\u002F1657246770152-1-300x226.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2023\u002F02\u002F1657246770152-1-300x226.jpeg 300w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2023\u002F02\u002F1657246770152-1-1024x772.jpeg 1024w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2023\u002F02\u002F1657246770152-1-768x579.jpeg 768w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2023\u002F02\u002F1657246770152-1.jpeg 1212w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\u003Cfigcaption\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: 11.5pt;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFinancial cycles and product cycles\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigcaption\u003E\u003C\u002Ffigure\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETech is very different today than in the 2000s. A handful of tech incumbents dominate the internet, exerting vast economic and cultural influence. In the 2000s, web 2 was mostly ignored or dismissed as techies talking about trivialities. Today, entrenched interests aggressively respond to new movements that might someday threaten them. But the same creative patterns that happened in the 2000s live on today, driven by enthusiasts who see possibilities where others don’t. You just need to know where to look. My belief is that the best place to look is crypto and web 3.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom my vantage point, today’s negative financial sentiment most closely resembles 2008. If we are headed for a prolonged downturn, there are some tactical lessons from the 2008 era, namely preserving capital and staying focused on your long-term vision. The strategic lesson is to keep your eyes squarely focused on the product cycle. Things that look interesting to smart people usually do so because they are rich with product possibilities. These possibilities eventually become reality. Toys become must-have tools. Weekend hobbies become mainstream activities. Cynics sound smart but optimists build the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n"}],related_posts:O},tags:[{term_id:G,name:E,slug:E,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:G,taxonomy:f,description:a,parent:b,count:ae,filter:d},{term_id:H,name:ab,slug:ac,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:H,taxonomy:f,description:a,parent:b,count:ad,filter:d},{term_id:j,name:p,slug:q,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:j,taxonomy:f,description:a,parent:b,count:s,filter:d}],post_thumbnail:a,post_thumbnail_small:a,post_images:[],authors:[{ID:al,display_name:am,first_name:a,last_name:a,user_login:t,user_email:a,linked_account:a,website:a,description:an,user_nicename:t,type:F,nickname:a}],meta_desc:a,seo:{title_tag:jW,meta_description:a,canonical:jX,robots:{index:P,follow:Q,"max-snippet":R,"max-image-preview":S,"max-video-preview":T},open_graph_locale:U,open_graph_type:k,open_graph_title:jW,open_graph_description:a,open_graph_url:jX,open_graph_images:[],open_graph_site_name:V,estimated_reading_time_minutes:b,twitter_card:W,twitter_title:a,twitter_description:a,twitter_image:a,open_graph_article_published_time:"2022-06-27T15:13:17+00:00"},format:{term_id:i,name:n,slug:k,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:i,taxonomy:l,description:a,parent:b,count:o,filter:d},template:a,disclosure:h},{ID:4760,post_author:cD,post_date:jY,post_date_gmt:jY,post_content:a,post_title:"Methods to the Madness",post_excerpt:a,post_status:K,comment_status:r,ping_status:r,post_password:a,post_name:"methods-to-the-madness",to_ping:a,pinged:a,post_modified:"2024-09-09 11:58:01",post_modified_gmt:"2024-09-09 18:58:01",post_content_filtered:a,post_parent:b,guid:"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.approvemyviews.com\u002F?p=4760",menu_order:b,post_type:N,post_mime_type:a,comment_count:A,filter:d,taxonomies:[{term_id:J,name:t,slug:ai,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:J,taxonomy:D,description:aj,parent:b,count:ak,filter:d},{term_id:cE,name:cF,slug:eW,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:cE,taxonomy:D,description:eX,parent:b,count:aO,filter:d},{term_id:jZ,name:fx,slug:"cap-sonal-chokshi",term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:jZ,taxonomy:D,description:"Sonal Chokshi   sonal-chokshi 2508 ",parent:b,count:45,filter:d},{term_id:G,name:E,slug:E,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:G,taxonomy:f,description:a,parent:b,count:ae,filter:d},{term_id:H,name:ab,slug:ac,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:H,taxonomy:f,description:a,parent:b,count:ad,filter:d},{term_id:L,name:ag,slug:ah,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:L,taxonomy:f,description:a,parent:b,count:ap,filter:d},{term_id:ca,name:dc,slug:dd,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:ca,taxonomy:f,description:a,parent:b,count:dQ,filter:d},{term_id:z,name:X,slug:m,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:z,taxonomy:l,description:a,parent:b,count:Z,filter:d},{term_id:B,name:_,slug:$,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:B,taxonomy:C,description:a,parent:b,count:aa,filter:d},{term_id:j,name:p,slug:q,term_group:b,term_taxonomy_id:j,taxonomy:f,description:a,parent:b,count:s,filter:d}],acf:{custom_title:a,redirect_author_links_to_the_post:h,post_redirector:h,content:[{acf_fc_layout:Y,paragraph:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fplayer.simplecast.com\u002Fe3d62b87-5de9-4dc7-a51f-65c2cd69a48e?dark=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200px\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"sc-episode-details-description-p\"\u003EA conversation about the markets and how recent events affect crypto and web3; mental models for thinking about crypto and web3, and the longer arc and evolution of technology history, open source, etc.; and methods &amp; metrics for measuring price-innovation cycle ebbs and flows, creators in web2 vs web3, and much more — as well as key trends that are top of mind.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 class=\"sc-episode-details-show-notes-text-heading\"\u003EEPISODE NOTES\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Ewith @cdixon @eddylazzarin @smc90\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA conversation about the markets and how recent events affect crypto and web3; mental models for thinking about crypto and web3, and the longer arc and evolution of technology history, open source, etc.; and methods &amp; metrics for measuring price-innovation cycle ebbs and flows, creators in web2 vs web3, and much more — as well as key trends that are top of mind.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003Eweb3 with a16z is a new podcast for anyone seeking to understand and go deeper on blockchains, crypto, and web3.

creativity of its community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDAOs are novel web3 constructs that supercharge online communities by providing more sophisticated coordination methods and control over internet-native financial resources.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the past year, thousands of DAOs have been created across a broad range of categories including financial services, investing,

internet services by removing layers of intermediaries and dramatically reducing take rates (fees charged by intermediaries).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis provides an opportunity for startups to attract and foster communities by providing superior economics to creators, developers, and other network participants.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, social networks like Instagram

Centralized exchanges like Coinbase have proven the efficacy of the “custodial” model for trading crypto, in which people keep their assets with a custodian that secures and keeps track of them. The key advantage of this model is convenience: It’s become relatively easy for anyone to use the Coinbase app or other exchanges to buy crypto without having to write down a “seed phrase,” the string of words that constitute the “private key” controlling access to the assets. In this way users can buy and sell various cryptocurrencies, trade them for other cryptocurrencies, use assets for purchases and payments, and soon \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fblog.coinbase.com\u002Fcoinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Epurchase NFTs\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E.  \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EVenturing further into the broader web3 ecosystem of fully decentralized interoperable apps and networks — not just exchanges, but play-to-earn games, tokenized social networks, fan-engagement communities, and other rich user experiences — is largely inaccessible through a custodian, however. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThat\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E web3 experience requires sending their crypto to a non-custodial wallet, in which no one but the user holds the private keys and there are no limits to the types of transactions that can be done.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIndeed, this is the most exciting part of crypto, but also where we see so many first time users drop off.

For Rally, we were already building on a sidechain, so it made sense to start out with a custodial approach. Just as we envisioned progressive decentralization for the RLY ecosystem, we decided the best approach for Rally would be to begin with a familiar experience for end users and build out capabilities to expand mainnet and self-custody capabilities over time. But other products would make different decisions; for example, decentralized trading, daily fantasy sports, or hardcore games that cater to higher spend users may be better suited for a non-custodial experience from the start. The sophistication of these user bases and increased need for trustlessness warrants a non-custodial user journey from the beginning.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Custodial experiences mean infrastructure requirements\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOf course, building apps that custody assets comes with its own hurdles and challenges. Namely, compliance and security. Allowing users to move from custodial to non-custodial wallets means that know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks will be unavoidable. In addition, by custodying assets you’re also taking on the risk associated with keeping these safe on behalf of your users in the face of some very sophisticated attackers. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ERight now, crypto companies are largely on their own for this. You either have to build and manage infrastructure yourself or find one of the few trustworthy partners out there. This was no small task for Rally &#8211; it’s doable, but not straightforward or cheap. The simple truth is that there really isn’t any prescriptive advice when it comes to compliance, as there are so many factors that determine a crypto project’s compliance strategy: what phase of growth is the company? What jurisdictions does it operate in?  What level of risk tolerance does leadership have? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOne great example of how two different approaches can work is Coinbase and FTX. Coinbase was always based in the U.S. and took a careful approach to regulation with heavy investment in compliance. FTX, on the other hand, mitigated risk by launching outside of the US first and growing the company internationally. Both approaches have proven to be successful with users. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIn fact, we’re currently seeing a new wave of crypto adoption coming from emerging markets that were previously ignored by web2 companies who couldn’t profitably run advertising models in these regions. Non-custodied experiences make emerging markets really easy to access, as the app is not responsible for compliance. Custodial experiences, on the other hand, involve a well-thought out approach to enabling these users across unique payments providers. For example, credit cards are often declined in these regions, yet there are often “non-traditional” rails such as buying crypto with cash at 7\u002F11s.  Even how and where you incorporate your company has an implication on what kind of custodial experiences you can offer.  \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut as the big web2 social and financial platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Square, and PayPal begin pushing further into crypto and requiring more services, the ecosystem will rapidly grow and finding reliable and affordable partners will be much easier.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Growing demand for web3 access\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWe’re closer to this evolution towards web3 than many realize.

When Robinhood announced that it would launch its crypto wallet imminently at Messari’s Mainnet conference in September, everyone expected a big response.

But other products would make different decisions; for example, decentralized trading, daily fantasy sports, or hardcore games that cater to higher spend users may be better suited for a non-custodial experience from the start.

This was no small task for Rally &#8211; it’s doable, but not straightforward or cheap. The simple truth is that there really isn’t any prescriptive advice when it comes to compliance, as there are so many factors that determine a crypto project’s compliance strategy: what phase of growth is the company?

Custodial experiences, on the other hand, involve a well-thought out approach to enabling these users across unique payments providers. For example, credit cards are often declined in these regions, yet there are often “non-traditional” rails such as buying crypto with cash at 7\u002F11s.  Even how and where you incorporate your company has an implication on what kind of custodial experiences you can offer.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut as the big web2 social and financial platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Square, and PayPal begin pushing further into crypto and requiring more services, the ecosystem will rapidly grow and finding reliable and affordable partners will be much easier.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Growing demand for web3 access\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWe’re closer to this evolution towards web3 than many realize.

Following the launch of its protocol, the team often seeks to decentralize the protocol in order to increase its security and to distribute management of its operation to a decentralized group of token holders. This decentralization is typically accomplished through the simultaneous issuance of a governance token; the launch of a decentralized governance protocol (typically a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO); and the granting of control over the protocol to the DAO.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis decentralization process can involve many different structures and entity forms. For instance, many DAOs do not have any legal entity affiliated with them and operate solely in the digital world, while others use multi-signature (“multisig”) wallets that act at the direction of the DAO. In certain cases, nonprofit foundations are established to oversee future development of the protocol at the direction of the DAO. In nearly all cases, the original developer team continues to operate, in order to act as one of many contributors to the ecosystem created by the protocol as well as to develop supplemental or ancillary products and services.

Additionally, since MakerDAO is decentralized and its protocol’s operation is trustless and permissionless, anyone can generate or buy Dai using the protocol. And because Dai’s code is open source, developers can integrate it into their apps in a self-service manner.

This maintains accessibility to the broader community, while not diluting the exclusivity of the original set or having those original owners feel like their contributions were downgraded.

The biggest mindset shift is moving from planning to something more like gardening.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn web2 companies, founders not only set a top-down vision but are responsible for growing a team and planning and executing against that vision. In web3, founders take on more the role of a gardener, helping cultivate and nurture potentially successful products but also setting up the space for it all to happen. While web3 founders still set the purpose of the organization, and its initial governance structure, the governance structure itself might quickly lead to new roles for them. Instead of optimizing for headcount growth or revenue and profitability, founders might be optimizing for protocol usage and quality of community. In addition, following any decentralization, founders must adapt to environments in which no hierarchical power structures exist, and where they are one of many actors championing the success of a given project. As such, prior to decentralizing, founders should ensure that they are setting up their project for success in such an environment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI witnessed some of this firsthand when I was chief of staff to Tony Hsieh, former CEO of Zappos.com, an e-commerce company now owned by Amazon.

Where a web2 leader would be focused on updating the product roadmap and driving toward new product launches, Zhang considers himself more of a gardener rather than a top-down builder. His role includes watching the FWB “neighborhood” (in this case, Discord channels) and curating it by retiring channels with little traction and helping support and grow channels that have momentum. By creating a framework for these channels — and playbooks for channel success (such as a mix of activity, clear leadership, and governance structures) — Zhang becomes more of an educator and communicator.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of founders of NFT projects, their role is primarily as originators and temporary stewards of intellectual property (IP). Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fyugalabs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ewrote\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, “We see ourselves as temporary stewards of IP that is in the process of becoming more and more decentralized. Our ambition is for this to be a community-owned brand, with tentacles in world-class gaming, events, and streetwear.” Owning an NFT — whether it’s an image, a video or sound clip, or another form — conveys to the owner all the rights associated with the NFT. As the NFT is bought and sold, that ownership is transferred — and as ecosystems grow around the NFT, those benefits go to the NFT owner, not just the founding team of the NFT project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENFT ownership can also be about community-driven licensing and community-driven content (unlike traditional IP \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fcrypto-and-community-owned-characters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efranchises\u003C\u002Fa\u003E).

Traditional web2 GTM frameworks are a useful reference, and offer some helpful playbooks — but they are just a few of the many frameworks available for web3 organizations. The key difference to remember is that the goals, growth, and success metrics of web2 and web3 are often not the same. Builders should start with a clear purpose, grow a community around that purpose, and match their growth strategies and community incentives — and with them, the go-to-market motions — accordingly.

Following the launch of its protocol, the team often seeks to decentralize the protocol in order to increase its security and to distribute management of its operation to a decentralized group of token holders. This decentralization is typically accomplished through the simultaneous issuance of a governance token; the launch of a decentralized governance protocol (typically a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO); and the granting of control over the protocol to the DAO.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis decentralization process can involve many different structures and entity forms.

Additionally, since MakerDAO is decentralized and its protocol’s operation is trustless and permissionless, anyone can generate or buy Dai using the protocol.

One recent notable airdrop was from the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fboredapeyachtclub.com\u002F#\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBored Ape Yacht Club\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs; on August 28, 2021, BAYC created the corresponding Mutant Ape Yacht Club. Each of the BAYC token holders \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theblockcrypto.com\u002Fpost\u002F129023\u002Fa-mutant-ape-yacht-club-serum-sold-for-nearly-6-million-heres-what-that-means-for-the-bored-ape-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ereceived a mutant serum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, allowing them to mint 10,000 “mutant” apes, and additionally a new 10,000 mutant apes became available for new entrants. Because there were different types of serums, serums could only be used once, and since a Bored Ape could not use multiple serums of the same tier, serums added a new scarcity model.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rationale behind the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fboredapeyachtclub.com\u002F#\u002Fmayc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecreation of the MAYC\u003C\u002Fa\u003E was to “reward our ape holders with an entirely new NFT” — a “mutant” version of their ape — while also allowing newcomers into the BAYC ecosystem at a lower tier of membership. This maintains accessibility to the broader community, while not diluting the exclusivity of the original set or having those original owners feel like their contributions were downgraded. (Another way of addressing accessibility is with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffractional.art\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ENFT fractionalization\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, where an NFT has multiple owners.) The MAYC floor price, or lowest listed price for a MAYC, is consistently lower than the BAYC floor price, but owners essentially have the same benefits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese airdrops were done retroactively to reward NFT holders or network and protocol users (as was the ENS airdrop), but airdrops can also be used as a \u003Ci\u003Eproactive \u003C\u002Fi\u003EGTM motion to generate awareness for a specific project and to encourage people to check it out. Since information is public on the blockchain, a new project can airdrop to, for example, all the wallets using a specific marketplace, or all the wallets holding a specific token.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, projects should clearly articulate their overall token distribution, breakdown, and plans before conducting the airdrop. There are many examples of airdrops being used for nefarious purposes and of airdrops \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcointelegraph.com\u002Fnews\u002Fairdrop-culture-could-pose-integral-threat-to-defi-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Egone wrong\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

The biggest mindset shift is moving from planning to something more like gardening.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn web2 companies, founders not only set a top-down vision but are responsible for growing a team and planning and executing against that vision. In web3, founders take on more the role of a gardener, helping cultivate and nurture potentially successful products but also setting up the space for it all to happen. While web3 founders still set the purpose of the organization, and its initial governance structure, the governance structure itself might quickly lead to new roles for them. Instead of optimizing for headcount growth or revenue and profitability, founders might be optimizing for protocol usage and quality of community. In addition, following any decentralization, founders must adapt to environments in which no hierarchical power structures exist, and where they are one of many actors championing the success of a given project. As such, prior to decentralizing, founders should ensure that they are setting up their project for success in such an environment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI witnessed some of this firsthand when I was chief of staff to Tony Hsieh, former CEO of Zappos.com, an e-commerce company now owned by Amazon.

But Hsieh offered a useful metaphor when comparing his role as being the cultivator of a greenhouse of plants (in the holacracy model), rather than being the best plant. He had said he needed to be the “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mckinsey.com\u002Fbusiness-functions\u002Fpeople-and-organizational-performance\u002Four-insights\u002Fsafe-enough-to-try-an-interview-with-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Earchitect of the greenhouse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” — setting the right conditions to enable all the\u003Ci\u003Eother\u003C\u002Fi\u003E plants to flourish and thrive.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Alex Zhang, Mayor of Friends with Benefits (FWB), the social DAO with a fungible token, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=EVB3URImebM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eechoes the sentiment\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, describing that his job “is not to set a top-down vision” but to facilitate the creation of “frameworks, permits, and regulations for community members” to approve and to build on top of. Where a web2 leader would be focused on updating the product roadmap and driving toward new product launches, Zhang considers himself more of a gardener rather than a top-down builder. His role includes watching the FWB “neighborhood” (in this case, Discord channels) and curating it by retiring channels with little traction and helping support and grow channels that have momentum. By creating a framework for these channels — and playbooks for channel success (such as a mix of activity, clear leadership, and governance structures) — Zhang becomes more of an educator and communicator.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of founders of NFT projects, their role is primarily as originators and temporary stewards of intellectual property (IP). Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fyugalabs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ewrote\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, “We see ourselves as temporary stewards of IP that is in the process of becoming more and more decentralized. Our ambition is for this to be a community-owned brand, with tentacles in world-class gaming, events, and streetwear.” Owning an NFT — whether it’s an image, a video or sound clip, or another form — conveys to the owner all the rights associated with the NFT. As the NFT is bought and sold, that ownership is transferred — and as ecosystems grow around the NFT, those benefits go to the NFT owner, not just the founding team of the NFT project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENFT ownership can also be about community-driven licensing and community-driven content (unlike traditional IP \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fcrypto-and-community-owned-characters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efranchises\u003C\u002Fa\u003E).

Traditional web2 GTM frameworks are a useful reference, and offer some helpful playbooks — but they are just a few of the many frameworks available for web3 organizations. The key difference to remember is that the goals, growth, and success metrics of web2 and web3 are often not the same. Builders should start with a clear purpose, grow a community around that purpose, and match their growth strategies and community incentives — and with them, the go-to-market motions — accordingly.

This meant that people or organizations could grow their internet presence knowing the rules of the game wouldn’t change later on. Huge web properties were started during this era including Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. In the process, the importance of centralized platforms like AOL greatly diminished.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the second era of the internet, from the mid 2000s to the present, for-profit tech companies — most notably Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) — built software and services that rapidly outpaced the capabilities of open protocols. The explosive growth of smartphones accelerated this trend as mobile apps became the majority of internet use. Eventually users migrated from open services to these more sophisticated, centralized services. Even when users still accessed open protocols like the web, they would typically do so mediated by GAFA software and services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that billions of people got access to amazing technologies, many of which were free to use. The bad news is that it became much harder for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presence without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them, taking away their audiences and profits. This in turn stifled innovation, making the internet less interesting and dynamic. Centralization has also created broader societal tensions, which we see in the debates over subjects like fake news, state sponsored bots, “no platforming” of users, EU privacy laws, and algorithmic biases. These debates will only intensify in the coming years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E“Web 3”: the third era of the internet\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne response to this centralization is to impose government regulation on large internet companies. This response assumes that the internet is similar to past communication networks like the phone, radio, and TV networks. But the hardware-based networks of the past are fundamentally different than the internet, a software-based network. Once hardware-based networks are built, they are nearly impossible to rearchitect. Software-based networks can be rearchitected through entrepreneurial innovation and market forces.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is the ultimate software-based network, consisting of a relatively simple \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FInternet_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecore layer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E connecting billions of fully programmable computers at the edge. Software is simply the encoding of human thought, and as such has an almost unbounded design space. Computers connected to the internet are, by and large, free to run whatever software their owners choose. Whatever can be dreamt up, with the right set of incentives, can quickly propagate across the internet. Internet architecture is where technical creativity and incentive design intersect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is still early in its evolution: the core internet services will likely be almost entirely rearchitected in the coming decades. This will be enabled by crypto-economic networks, a generalization of the ideas first introduced in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbitcoin.org\u002Fbitcoin.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBitcoin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and further developed in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fethereum\u002Fwiki\u002Fwiki\u002FWhite-Paper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEthereum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy decentralization?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization is a commonly misunderstood concept. For example, it is sometimes said that the reason cryptonetwork advocates favor decentralization is to resist government censorship, or because of libertarian political views. These are not the main reasons decentralization is important.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s look at the problems with centralized platforms. Centralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. When they start out, they do everything they can to recruit users and 3rd-party complements like developers, businesses, and media organizations. They do this to make their services more valuable, as platforms (by definition) are systems with multi-sided network effects. As platforms move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and 3rd parties steadily grows.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8389 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG.png 681w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG-300x129.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing lies in extracting data from users and competing with complements over audiences and profits. Historical examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, and Twitter vs. its 3rd-party clients. Operating systems like iOS and Android have behaved better, although still take a healthy 30% tax, reject apps for seemingly arbitrary reasons, and subsume the functionality of 3rd-party apps at will.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor 3rd parties, this transition from cooperation to competition feels like a bait-and-switch. Over time, the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors have become wary of building on top of centralized platforms. We now have decades of evidence that doing so will end in disappointment. In addition, users give up privacy, control of their data, and become vulnerable to security breaches. These problems with centralized platforms will likely become even more pronounced in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EEnter cryptonetworks\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptonetworks are networks built on top of the internet that 1) use consensus mechanisms such as blockchains to maintain and update state, 2) use cryptocurrencies (coins\u002Ftokens) to incentivize consensus participants (miners\u002Fvalidators) and other network participants. Some cryptonetworks, such as Ethereum, are general programming platforms that can be used for almost any purpose. Other cryptonetworks are special purpose, for example Bitcoin is intended primarily for storing value, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgolem.network\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGolem\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for performing computations, and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffilecoin.io\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFilecoin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for decentralized file storage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly internet protocols were technical specifications created by working groups or non-profit organizations that relied on the alignment of interests in the internet community to gain adoption. This method worked well during the very early stages of the internet but since the early 1990s very few new protocols have gained widespread adoption. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F18\u002F2017\u002F05\u002F27\u002Fcrypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECryptonetworks fix\u003C\u002Fa\u003E these problems by providing economics incentives to developers, maintainers, and other network participants in the form of tokens. They are also much more technically robust. For example, they are able to keep state and do arbitrary transformations on that state, something past protocols could never do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptonetworks use multiple mechanisms to ensure that they stay neutral as they grow, preventing the bait-and-switch of centralized platforms. First, the contract between cryptonetworks and their participants is enforced in open source code. Second, they are kept in check through mechanisms for \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FExit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E“voice” and “exit.”\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Participants are given voice through community governance, both “on chain” (via the protocol) and “off chain” (via the social structures around the protocol). Participants can exit either by leaving the network and selling their coins, or in the extreme case by forking the protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, cryptonetworks align network participants to work together toward a common goal — the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This alignment is one of the main reasons Bitcoin continues to defy skeptics and flourish, even while new cryptonetworks like Ethereum have grown alongside it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday’s cryptonetworks suffer from limitations that keep them from seriously challenging centralized incumbents. The most severe limitations are around performance and scalability. The next few years will be about fixing these limitations and building networks that form the infrastructure layer of the crypto stack. After that, most of the energy will turn to building applications on top of that infrastructure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow decentralization wins\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s one thing to say decentralized networks should win, and another thing to say they will win. Let’s look at specific reasons to be optimistic about this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware and web services are built by developers. There are millions of highly skilled developers in the world. Only a small fraction work at large technology companies, and only a small fraction of those work on new product development. Many of the most important software projects in history were created by startups or by communities of independent developers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.” — \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FJoy%27s_law_(management)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBill Joy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized networks can win the third era of the internet for the same reason they won the first era: by winning the hearts and minds of entrepreneurs and developers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn illustrative analogy is the rivalry in the 2000s between Wikipedia and its centralized competitors like Encarta. If you compared the two products in the early 2000s, Encarta was a far better product, with better topic coverage and higher accuracy. But Wikipedia improved at a much faster rate, because it had an active community of volunteer contributors who were attracted to its decentralized, community-governed ethos. By 2005, Wikipedia was the most \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@cdixon\u002Fit-s-hard-to-believe-today-but-10-years-ago-wikipedia-was-widely-considered-a-doomed-experiment-a7a0dfd27b8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epopular\u003C\u002Fa\u003E reference site on the internet. Encarta was shut down in 2009.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lesson is that when you compare centralized and decentralized systems you need to consider them dynamically, as processes, instead of statically, as rigid products. Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of cryptonetworks, there are multiple, compounding feedback loops involving developers of the core protocol, developers of complementary cryptonetworks, developers of 3rd party applications, and service providers who operate the network. These feedback loops are further amplified by the incentives of the associated token, which — as we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum — can supercharge the rate at which crypto communities develop (and sometimes lead to negative outcomes, as with the excessive electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question of whether decentralized or centralized systems will win the next era of the internet reduces to who will build the most compelling products, which in turn reduces to who will get more high quality developers and entrepreneurs on their side. GAFA has many advantages, including cash reserves, large user bases, and operational infrastructure. Cryptonetworks have a significantly more attractive value proposition to developers and entrepreneurs. If they can win their hearts and minds, they can mobilize far more resources than GAFA, and rapidly outpace their product development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“If you asked people in 1989 what they needed to make their life better, it was unlikely that they would have said a decentralized network of information nodes that are linked using hypertext.” — \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffarmerandfarmer.org\u002Fmastery\u002Fbuilder.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFarmer &amp; Farmer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECentralized platforms often come bundled at launch with compelling apps: Facebook had its core socializing features and the iPhone had a number of key apps. Decentralized platforms, by contrast, often launch half-baked and without clear use cases. As a result, they need to go through two phases of product-market fit: 1) product-market fit between the platform and the developers\u002Fentrepreneurs who will finish the platform and build out the ecosystem, and 2) product-market fit between the platform\u002Fecosystem and end users. This two-stage process is what causes many people — including sophisticated technologists — to consistently underestimate the potential of decentralized platforms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe next era of the internet\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized networks aren’t a silver bullet that will fix all the problems on the internet. But they offer a much better approach than centralized systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECompare the problem of Twitter spam to the problem of email spam. Since Twitter \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theverge.com\u002F2012\u002F8\u002F23\u002F3263481\u002Ftwitter-api-third-party-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eclosed\u003C\u002Fa\u003E their network to 3rd-party developers, the only company working on Twitter spam has been Twitter itself. By contrast, there were hundreds of companies that tried to fight email spam, financed by billions of dollars in venture capital and corporate funding. Email spam isn’t solved, but it’s a lot better now, because 3rd parties knew that the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FSimple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eemail protocol\u003C\u002Fa\u003E was decentralized, so they could build businesses on top of it without worrying about the rules of the game changing later on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr consider the problem of network governance. Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms. As we know from the offline world, democratic systems aren’t perfect, but they are a lot better than the alternatives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECentralized platforms have been dominant for so long that many people have forgotten there is a better way to build internet services. Cryptonetworks are a powerful way to develop community-owned networks and provide a level playing field for 3rd-party developers, creators, and businesses. We saw the value of decentralized systems in the first era of the internet. Hopefully we’ll get to see it again in the next.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
