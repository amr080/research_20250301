In finance, our whole legal system is pretty much designed around trying to mitigate the risk of one individual having to trust another with money. We have a lot of laws around intermediaries and rules around how they&#8217;re able to act &#8212; all designed to protect consumers from the conflicts of interest that those intermediaries might have. In a peer-to-peer system, like you can have with a blockchain, you don&#8217;t need intermediaries. As a result, it&#8217;s not necessary to apply intermediary-based legal regimes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, because decentralized exchanges enable disintermediated peer-to-peer exchanges of digital assets, broker-dealer rules that are meant to protect investors from intermediaries are largely unnecessary. Rules regarding conflicts of interest don’t make sense where conflicts of interest aren’t possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA similar concept applies to digital assets and securities laws. Securities laws are meant to address risks by requiring disclosure requirements and creating a level playing field where all investors are on the same kind of footing &#8212; because otherwise you’d end up with market manipulation and people taking advantage of other people and, ultimately, inefficient capital markets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe way that our legal system generally looks at securities is that information asymmetries are most likely to happen when you have managerial efforts driving the value of a given asset. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11288\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F06\u002Fdecentralization-types_jenningsa16z.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F06\u002Fdecentralization-types_jenningsa16z.png 936w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F06\u002Fdecentralization-types_jenningsa16z-300x169.png 300w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2024\u002F06\u002Fdecentralization-types_jenningsa16z-768x433.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EJust think about the difference between Apple stock and oil: \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOne reason Apple stock is treated like a security is because Tim Cook has access to a lot of information that might affect the value of Apple stock.

So in order for Apple&#8217;s stock to publicly trade on markets they&#8217;re obligated to disclose all of the material information that might be relevant to the price of that asset.

Understanding the differences in these elements is key to designing web3 systems because design decisions with respect to one affects the others.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ETechnical decentralization\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnical decentralization relates primarily to the \u003Cstrong\u003Esecurity\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Estructural mechanisms\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. The core innovation behind programmable blockchains is that they can support technical decentralization by providing a permissionless, trustless, and verifiable ecosystem in which value can be transferred &#8212; and, more importantly, upon which web3 products and services can be \u003Cem\u003Ebuilt\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis means that products and services can be deployed and run without requiring trusted, centralized intermediaries to operate (or pull the rug out from under) them, opening a vast world of possibilities. For these reasons, technical decentralization acts as the \u003Cem\u003Efoundation\u003C\u002Fem\u003E upon which the other two types of decentralization can occur: economic and legal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EEconomic decentralization\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEconomic decentralization relates to the \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomies\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. The advent of programmable blockchains (such as Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche) and digital assets (such as ETH, SOL, and AVAX) unlocked the ability of open source and decentralized systems to finally have their own \u003Cstrong\u003Edecentralized\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomies\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (i.e., autonomous free-market economies).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a critical breakthrough. The open source and decentralized protocols of previous generations of technology like web1 (such as http, smtp, ftp, etc.) stagnated because they lacked the ability to incentivize ongoing development and\u002F or further investment of critical resources back into their systems. This left fertile ground for the centralized companies of web2 to emerge and succeed as they were able to leverage their efficiency and resources to build products and services that surpassed those of web1. But this centralization also led to countless examples of user rights abuses, de-platforming, and aggressive take-rates.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, the technology underpinning web3 makes it possible for far more sophisticated open source and decentralized systems to be created &#8212; and enables decentralized economies to form around them &#8212; which will enable the products and services of web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of web2.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilders of web3 systems can facilitate the formation of decentralized economies through careful design decisions that lead to their systems accruing “value” &#8212; whether information, economic value, voting power, or other form &#8212; from a broad array of sources, and distributing that value equitably among system stakeholders according to their contributions. In order to achieve this, web3 systems need to vest meaningful power, control, and ownership to system stakeholders (via airdrops, other token distributions, decentralized governance, etc.). This in turn encourages stakeholders to contribute meaningful value, because they have agency over how their contributions are treated and rewarded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ongoing balancing of incentives among the stakeholders &#8212; developers, contributors, and consumers &#8212; can then drive further contributions of value to the overall system, to the benefit of all. In other words: all the benefits of modern network effects, but without the pitfalls of centralized control and captive economies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ELegal decentralization\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELegal decentralization relates to the \u003Cstrong\u003Elegality\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. In this piece, I focus primarily on U.S. securities laws, which dictate how and whether web3 systems may make use of their own native digital assets. While there is no codified standard of “legal decentralization,” a first-principles analysis of U.S. securities laws, case law, and SEC guidance (including the SEC’s \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fcorpfin\u002F%20framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets#_edn1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edefinitive guidance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E from April 2019) can help us formulate a practical standard.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, U.S. securities laws are generally intended to create a “level playing field” for securities transactions by limiting the ability of those with more information from taking advantage of others with less information. This is the principle of \u003Cstrong\u003Einformation asymmetry\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and U.S. securities laws typically seek to eliminate asymmetry in certain securities transactions by applying disclosure requirements. The principle plays a role in the \u003Cem\u003EHowey \u003C\u002Fem\u003Etest, the subjective test that determines whether U.S. securities laws should apply to a digital assets transaction where there is (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profit (4) primarily based upon the managerial efforts of others. The fourth prong seeks to address information asymmetry on the basis of the belief that where there is a reliance on “managerial efforts”, the risk of information asymmetry (of the managers versus outsiders) is likely high, and therefore the application of securities laws may be necessary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the above and SEC guidance, we can surmise that if a web3 system can (a) eliminate the potential for significant information asymmetries to arise and (b) eliminate reliance on essential managerial efforts of others to drive the success or failure of that enterprise, then the system \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C\u002Fem\u003E be “sufficiently decentralized” such that the application of U.S. securities laws to its digital assets shouldn’t be necessary. For purposes of this piece, I refer to these systems as being \u003Cstrong\u003Elegally decentralized\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Admittedly, the legal decentralization threshold will not be capable of being met by most businesses, but as I outline below, the novel components of web3 systems uniquely position them to meet such a threshold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECollectively, these three separate aspects of decentralization &#8212; technical, economic, legal &#8212; must be viewed holistically, as a single design challenge, because design decisions with respect to one will affect another. In general, the interplay between \u003Cstrong\u003Etechnical\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomic\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Elegal\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is primarily \u003Cem\u003Eadditive\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, not subtractive &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Edevelopments in one create more possibilities in the others\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. For example: Decentralized economies help drive systems towards legal decentralization by prioritizing decentralized ownership among stakeholders, value accretion from decentralized sources, and value distribution to decentralized stakeholders. All of these decrease the risk of information asymmetries and the need to rely on managerial efforts of individuals.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor more background on legal and economic decentralization and how these aspects fit together, see the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F04\u002Fprinciples-and-models-of-decentralization_miles-jennings_a16zcrypto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efull paper\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed headline=&#8221;(2) components for decentralization&#8221;]\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(2) How the components of web3 systems can be used to achieve decentralization \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen web3 systems are designed well, decentralization becomes a virtuous, not vicious circle.

Within DeFi, where most clients are just simple frontend websites that provide a gateway to the underlying smart contract protocol (that is, they allow users to interact with the protocol), most developer companies make their client\u002F website open source, and host it on a decentralized file system (such as IPFS). With the client\u002F website open source, third parties that are independent from the developer company often end up hosting their own clients\u002F websites providing access to the same underlying protocol. In addition, independent third parties often build gateways to the protocol into their own aggregators and dashboards. This means that gateways to the protocol are always available, regardless of whether the developer company’s client\u002F website is maintained.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe above steps mostly eliminate the potential for information asymmetries &#8212; the impetus for much of the U.S. securities laws &#8212; because (1) information about the protocol and its operations are transparently available on a public blockchain ledger, and (2) the managerial efforts of the developer company that launched the protocol are no longer critical to the success or failure of such protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd since the blockchain and smart contract layers are operational and not controlled by any group or entity, the system has full redundancy and is no longer reliant on the developer company. DeFi primitives are a great example of this because they require little to no ongoing development to continue providing users with utility. As a result, protocols implementing this decentralization model could be considered legally decentralized, even without a fully functioning decentralized economy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003ELimitations of full decentralization\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the full decentralization model has been successfully used in DeFi, its simplicity could make it unsuitable for more complex web3 systems.

The decentralization of clients within DeFi is somewhat straightforward given their relative simplicity &#8212; very little incentivization is necessary to get third parties to build independent and simple gateways (mostly in the form of websites) to such protocols. However, as web3 products and services become increasingly complex, with computationally expensive\u002F resource-intensive client layers built on top of underlying smart contract protocols, the decentralization of the client becomes more complicated. For example, consider the difference in complexity of the clients\u002F websites that provide access to the \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Funiswap.org\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EUniswap\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"blank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECompound\u003C\u002Fa\u003E protocols, as compared to hypothetical web3 social media clients, which would need the full-featured functionality of web2 applications like Twitter and Instagram.

Even if the intellectual property was critical to the success of the system, if the owner of the intellectual property could not revoke it at any time, then the answer to both questions could be no &#8212; thus supporting the legal decentralization of the system.

But as NFT projects have grown in complexity, the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E analysis has become less straightforward.

What would that model of NFT project decentralization look like? The image below is one example. It reflects: (1) an NFT collection minted on a blockchain and held by various users; (2) intellectual property contributed to the NFT community, most likely relating to the NFTs themselves (which could be “staked” to the community by the holders) and any lore created by the community; (3) digital assets distributions and incentivization mechanisms; (4) the launching of DAO governance with respect to the community intellectual property and DAO treasury; (5) the initiation of derivative projects; and (6) the hosting of social gatherings and events.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5191 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F04\u002Fweb3opendecentralizationmodelfornfts_milesjennings_a16zcrypto-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"web3 open decentralization model for NFTs\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1445\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this model, economic decentralization for NFT projects can be achieved through several steps:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFirst, the DAO could use its initial resources on community engagement (e.g., Twitter,Discord, etc.) and to fund social gatherings and other events &#8212; thereby boosting the \u003Cstrong\u003Eimplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of the community (i.e., its popularity).\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESecond, those \u003Cstrong\u003Eimplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8212; along with \u003Cstrong\u003Eexplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (such as fungible token awards, access to NFT sales, etc.) &#8212; could then be used to incentivize the creation of \u003Cstrong\u003Ederivative projects\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E utilizing the community’s intellectual property. Developers would receive rewards for developing such projects, and consumers would receive awards for using them. For example, the DAO could employ a third-party developer to create a play-to-earn game using the community’s characters, with in-game tokenomics featuring the native digital asset of the community. In this regard, derivative projects act similarly to the clients described in the earlier open decentralization models, making the overall system less dependent on any single source to drive value to NFT holders, which helps limit the risk of significant information asymmetries arising.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFinally, another significant tool that NFT projects have at their disposal are \u003Cem\u003Eroyalties on secondary sales\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of NFTs accruing to the DAO, which can fuel their decentralized economies.

The open source and decentralized protocols of previous generations of technology like web1 (such as http, smtp, ftp, etc.) stagnated because they lacked the ability to incentivize ongoing development and\u002F or further investment of critical resources back into their systems. This left fertile ground for the centralized companies of web2 to emerge and succeed as they were able to leverage their efficiency and resources to build products and services that surpassed those of web1. But this centralization also led to countless examples of user rights abuses, de-platforming, and aggressive take-rates.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, the technology underpinning web3 makes it possible for far more sophisticated open source and decentralized systems to be created &#8212; and enables decentralized economies to form around them &#8212; which will enable the products and services of web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of web2.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilders of web3 systems can facilitate the formation of decentralized economies through careful design decisions that lead to their systems accruing “value” &#8212; whether information, economic value, voting power, or other form &#8212; from a broad array of sources, and distributing that value equitably among system stakeholders according to their contributions. In order to achieve this, web3 systems need to vest meaningful power, control, and ownership to system stakeholders (via airdrops, other token distributions, decentralized governance, etc.). This in turn encourages stakeholders to contribute meaningful value, because they have agency over how their contributions are treated and rewarded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ongoing balancing of incentives among the stakeholders &#8212; developers, contributors, and consumers &#8212; can then drive further contributions of value to the overall system, to the benefit of all. In other words: all the benefits of modern network effects, but without the pitfalls of centralized control and captive economies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Legal decentralization\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELegal decentralization relates to the \u003Cstrong\u003Elegality\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. In this piece, I focus primarily on U.S. securities laws, which dictate how and whether web3 systems may make use of their own native digital assets. While there is no codified standard of “legal decentralization,” a first-principles analysis of U.S. securities laws, case law, and SEC guidance (including the SEC’s definitive guidance from April 2019) can help us formulate a practical standard.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, U.S. securities laws are generally intended to create a “level playing field” for securities transactions by limiting the ability of those with more information from taking advantage of others with less information. This is the principle of \u003Cstrong\u003Einformation asymmetry\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and U.S. securities laws typically seek to eliminate asymmetry in certain securities transactions by applying disclosure requirements. The principle plays a role in the \u003Cem\u003EHowey \u003C\u002Fem\u003Etest, the subjective test that determines whether U.S. securities laws should apply to a digital assets transaction where there is (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profit (4) primarily based upon the managerial efforts of others. The fourth prong seeks to address information asymmetry on the basis of the belief that where there is a reliance on “managerial efforts”, the risk of information asymmetry (of the managers versus outsiders) is likely high, and therefore the application of securities laws may be necessary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the above and SEC guidance, we can surmise that if a web3 system can (a) eliminate the potential for significant information asymmetries to arise and (b) eliminate reliance on essential managerial efforts of others to drive the success or failure of that enterprise, then the system \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C\u002Fem\u003E be “sufficiently decentralized” such that the application of U.S. securities laws to its digital assets shouldn’t be necessary. For purposes of this piece, I refer to these systems as being \u003Cstrong\u003Elegally decentralized\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Admittedly, the legal decentralization threshold will not be capable of being met by most businesses, but as I outline below, the novel components of web3 systems uniquely position them to meet such a threshold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECollectively, these three separate aspects of decentralization &#8212; technical, economic, legal &#8212; must be viewed holistically, as a single design challenge, because design decisions with respect to one will affect another. In general, the interplay between \u003Cstrong\u003Etechnical\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomic\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Elegal\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is primarily \u003Cem\u003Eadditive\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, not subtractive &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Edevelopments in one create more possibilities in the others\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. For example: Decentralized economies help drive systems towards legal decentralization by prioritizing decentralized ownership among stakeholders, value accretion from decentralized sources, and value distribution to decentralized stakeholders.

Within DeFi, where most clients are just simple frontend websites that provide a gateway to the underlying smart contract protocol (that is, they allow users to interact with the protocol), most developer companies make their client\u002F website open source, and host it on a decentralized file system (such as IPFS). With the client\u002F website open source, third parties that are independent from the developer company often end up hosting their own clients\u002F websites providing access to the same underlying protocol. In addition, independent third parties often build gateways to the protocol into their own aggregators and dashboards.

The decentralization of clients within DeFi is somewhat straightforward given their relative simplicity &#8212; very little incentivization is necessary to get third parties to build independent and simple gateways (mostly in the form of websites) to such protocols. However, as web3 products and services become increasingly complex, with computationally expensive\u002F resource-intensive client layers built on top of underlying smart contract protocols, the decentralization of the client becomes more complicated. For example, consider the difference in complexity of the clients\u002F websites that provide access to the \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Funiswap.org\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EUniswap\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"blank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECompound\u003C\u002Fa\u003E protocols, as compared to hypothetical web3 social media clients, which would need the full-featured functionality of web2 applications like Twitter and Instagram.

In more complex web3 systems, we would expect to see the prevalence of such awards increase significantly. For example, in a decentralized social media ecosystem, a client’s user engagement could be measured and rewarded via tokens. Finally, in addition to incentives from the protocol, the operators of clients would be incentivized by any financial returns they are able to generate through their own proprietary clients.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilders seeking to decentralize their web3 systems via the open decentralization model will need to design their incentive mechanisms and their decentralized governance models to be “client agnostic” to encourage participation by many actors.

If such imbalances could easily occur, then the builders of these clients could view the web3 system unfavorably and be less willing to invest their time and resources in it.

It reflects: (1) an NFT collection minted on a blockchain and held by various users; (2) intellectual property contributed to the NFT community, most likely relating to the NFTs themselves (which could be “staked” to the community by the holders) and any lore created by the community; (3) digital assets distributions and incentivization mechanisms; (4) the launching of DAO governance with respect to the community intellectual property and DAO treasury; (5) the initiation of derivative projects; and (6) the hosting of social gatherings and events.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5191 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F04\u002Fweb3opendecentralizationmodelfornfts_milesjennings_a16zcrypto-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"web3 open decentralization model for NFTs\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1445\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this model, economic decentralization for NFT projects can be achieved through several steps:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFirst, the DAO could use its initial resources on community engagement (e.g., Twitter,Discord, etc.) and to fund social gatherings and other events &#8212; thereby boosting the \u003Cstrong\u003Eimplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of the community (i.e., its popularity).\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESecond, those \u003Cstrong\u003Eimplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8212; along with \u003Cstrong\u003Eexplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (such as fungible token awards, access to NFT sales, etc.) &#8212; could then be used to incentivize the creation of \u003Cstrong\u003Ederivative projects\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E utilizing the community’s intellectual property. Developers would receive rewards for developing such projects, and consumers would receive awards for using them. For example, the DAO could employ a third-party developer to create a play-to-earn game using the community’s characters, with in-game tokenomics featuring the native digital asset of the community. In this regard, derivative projects act similarly to the clients described in the earlier open decentralization models, making the overall system less dependent on any single source to drive value to NFT holders, which helps limit the risk of significant information asymmetries arising.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFinally, another significant tool that NFT projects have at their disposal are \u003Cem\u003Eroyalties on secondary sales\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of NFTs accruing to the DAO, which can fuel their decentralized economies.

Why? Because the intellectual property is contributed to the DAO from a decentralized source (the NFT holders).

But analysis of recent SEC commentary and enforcement actions suggests that true decentralization may enable a startup&#8217;s token to transmute from a security to a non-security if the team is able to sufficiently decentralize operations, eliminating information asymmetry or dependency on the efforts of the founding team to create value. One key test for whether an investment might be deemed a security is whether investors are relying on the efforts of others with the expectation of profits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Scott Kupor, managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F22\u002Fmutability-sec-recent-cases\u002F\"\u003Ehas previously written\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: “In the pre-network stage, tokens will generally be characterized as securities in light of the ‘reliance on the efforts of others’ prong of the Howey Test.

During this phase, the only thing that matters is product\u002Fmarket fit. To move fast toward finding it, it&#8217;s important to avoid design by committee (or community!) A product needs opinionated leadership to test hypotheses and update assumptions quickly. In practice, this could mean admin privileges on smart contracts, which allow for rapid iteration and product management — including upgrades, shutdown, or quick parameter setting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage, there should be no pretense of decentralization — a core team is driving all product decisions by necessity, in the interest of finding product\u002Fmarket fit. Launching a token at this stage is not advisable because it could trip compliance wires. Dependence on the core team&#8217;s efforts is one way a token might be deemed a security under the Howey Test, and thinking about this is a distraction from product development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of a core team controlling all aspects of a project may ruffle the feathers of some early users, but founders shouldn’t be wary of this. If users are complaining about the control you&#8217;ve got, that&#8217;s actually a good problem to have! It means someone cares about what you&#8217;ve built. That said, it&#8217;s important to communicate clearly about where control exists. Faking autonomy is a quick way to undermine trust, whereas transparency is a way to build it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Objective 2: Community Participation\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt early signs of product traction — a growing user base, developer ecosystem and network effects — it&#8217;s time to start devoting more cycles to fostering harmony between passive users, more-active contributors and the core team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, founders might invest more heavily in best practices for running the product like an open source project: invest in good documentation; develop openly; offer bounties, grants or other incentives for third-party development; hire community leaders to help steward open development; and introduce\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftools.ietf.org\u002Fhtml\u002Frfc7282\"\u003E rough consensus\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on decision making.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing further, it may make sense to start eliminating platform risk through imposed technical constraints.

In order to provide the same pricing in a fee-free fork, you&#8217;d need to coordinate all the liquidity providers and third-party services integrated with the original to start using said fork. The cost of coordinating all that is a switching cost. While such switching costs are lower in crypto where data is open, they still do exist.

A number of teams have elected to do this by allocating a slice of future tokens to early “power” contributors, for example through testnet programs where independent community members can register to participate in operating a node. A promissory and managed token distribution to users that contribute valuable work can help eliminate community dependency on the effort of founding teams.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, teams need to plan how remaining tokens will be distributed to participants, both fairly for past contributions, and effectively as a future incentive for ongoing participation\u003Cb\u003E.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E The distribution design needs to consider the core team that built the product, as well as the users that make it useful.

Without a working product, ownership is worthless, and the community won&#8217;t stick. Many teams that have done this are unable to back into product\u002Fmarket fit, and as a result have a hard time kickstarting meaningful community participation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother sequencing risk is jumping straight from early signs of product\u002Fmarket fit to decentralized community ownership (skipping objective 2, community participation.) Failing to formalize \u003Ci\u003Ereal\u003C\u002Fi\u003E community participation can land projects in an uncanny valley of decentralization theater. A symptom of being caught here is an apathetic community with low participation rates, and a heavy dependency on founding teams. In this situation, formalizing control (e.g. through delegation) may be a better path to building trust, whereas hiding under the pretense of decentralization is a quick way to undermine it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to get stuck is to aim to do all three things at once. Lack of focus is the death of most startups, and the same is true for crypto applications. Each of these objectives overlap and needs to be considered holistically, as part of an idea maze, but execution needs to be sequenced and prioritized, not attempted at once.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, it’s worth noting that even if you do the steps in order, once you flip the switch to full community ownership, you&#8217;re in fairly uncharted territory in terms of governing the application. Scaling effective community decision-making is challenging, but if internet communities can accomplish feats like Wikipedia, I&#8217;m optimistic that experimentation and skin-in-the-game (via valuable ownership) can lead to cooperative decision-making at unprecedented scale.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo far, we have yet to see a crypto application execute each of the objectives sequentially, but the most promising project teams I’ve spoken with have been navigating their way through this playbook.

In contrast, user-owned networks can benefit from a\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fjessewalden.com\u002Fpast-present-future-from-co-ops-to-cryptonetworks\u002F\"\u003E cooperative economic model\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that helps ensure crypto services remain better aligned with their users, even as they scale.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother important reason for achieving decentralized community control is regulatory compliance\u003Cb\u003E.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E Crypto tokens that facilitate economic alignment can be deemed securities under the\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2018\u002F05\u002F04\u002Fconsiderations-for-regulating-cryptonetworks\u002F\"\u003E Howey Test\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a regulatory framework used by the SEC. Managing a distribution of securities to a large community of users can be challenging and expensive for a startup to manage — even Airbnb and Uber \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pillsburylaw.com\u002Fen\u002Fnews-and-insights\u002Frule-701-revision-uber-airbnb.html\"\u003Ehaven’t figured out how to do it\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. But analysis of recent SEC commentary and enforcement actions suggests that true decentralization may enable a startup&#8217;s token to transmute from a security to a non-security if the team is able to sufficiently decentralize operations, eliminating information asymmetry or dependency on the efforts of the founding team to create value. One key test for whether an investment might be deemed a security is whether investors are relying on the efforts of others with the expectation of profits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Scott Kupor, managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F22\u002Fmutability-sec-recent-cases\u002F\"\u003Ehas previously written\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: “In the pre-network stage, tokens will generally be characterized as securities in light of the ‘reliance on the efforts of others’ prong of the Howey Test. However, post-network launch — provided that the network is sufficiently decentralized — the nature of the token can change from security to non-security, owing to the fact that the holder of the token is no longer relying on the efforts of others.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, with these reasons for decentralization in mind, let’s walk through a framework for tackling it as a process, with the goal of building a sustainable, compliant and community-owned product.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Objective 1: Product\u002FMarket Fit\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe earliest stage of building a crypto application requires all the ingredients of a normal startup: a great team, lean development, tight execution, and quick learning. During this phase, the only thing that matters is product\u002Fmarket fit. To move fast toward finding it, it&#8217;s important to avoid design by committee (or community!) A product needs opinionated leadership to test hypotheses and update assumptions quickly. In practice, this could mean admin privileges on smart contracts, which allow for rapid iteration and product management — including upgrades, shutdown, or quick parameter setting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage, there should be no pretense of decentralization — a core team is driving all product decisions by necessity, in the interest of finding product\u002Fmarket fit. Launching a token at this stage is not advisable because it could trip compliance wires. Dependence on the core team&#8217;s efforts is one way a token might be deemed a security under the Howey Test, and thinking about this is a distraction from product development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of a core team controlling all aspects of a project may ruffle the feathers of some early users, but founders shouldn’t be wary of this. If users are complaining about the control you&#8217;ve got, that&#8217;s actually a good problem to have! It means someone cares about what you&#8217;ve built. That said, it&#8217;s important to communicate clearly about where control exists. Faking autonomy is a quick way to undermine trust, whereas transparency is a way to build it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Objective 2: Community Participation\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt early signs of product traction — a growing user base, developer ecosystem and network effects — it&#8217;s time to start devoting more cycles to fostering harmony between passive users, more-active contributors and the core team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, founders might invest more heavily in best practices for running the product like an open source project: invest in good documentation; develop openly; offer bounties, grants or other incentives for third-party development; hire community leaders to help steward open development; and introduce\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftools.ietf.org\u002Fhtml\u002Frfc7282\"\u003E rough consensus\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on decision making.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing further, it may make sense to start eliminating platform risk through imposed technical constraints. For example, in Compound v2.2,\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fcompound-finance\u002Fupgrading-compound-governance-c56b55a2996c\"\u003E upgrades take effect 48 hours after they are pushed\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, allowing time for users to exit the protocol, or review and voice dissent.

But as you go about engaging community members, it&#8217;s important to revisit incentives. Why will community members contribute to the product on an ongoing basis?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EIncentives (Fees)\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn economic incentive is one way to engender community contribution. But where do the economics come from? A pragmatic and familiar business model for crypto services is a fee-per-call, similar to an API micro-service like Twilio or Stripe. Distributing this fee stream to active contributors can align the community around the project’s success.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat said, fees don&#8217;t always make sense at the outset of a project. Given that crypto services are open source, it may be better to introduce fees only once there are strong network effects, resulting in defensibility through switching costs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Funiswap.exchange\u002F\"\u003EUniswap\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a decentralized exchange, is an example of how a crypto application with a fee can be protected by the power of its network effects. In Uniswap, the more users that contribute liquidity to an exchange pair, the better the pricing for traders. In order to provide the same pricing in a fee-free fork, you&#8217;d need to coordinate all the liquidity providers and third-party services integrated with the original to start using said fork. The cost of coordinating all that is a switching cost. While such switching costs are lower in crypto where data is open, they still do exist. In crypto, however, protocols must remain \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.placeholder.vc\u002Fblog\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F6\u002Fprotocols-as-minimally-extractive-coordinators\"\u003Eminimally extractive\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (in other words, they cover relevant costs rather than seek to maximize profit) in order to incentivize community contribution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDistribution (Tokens)\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETokens are an instrument for effectively distributing the fundamental value of a project, including a fee stream. While token distribution can incent participation and help build defensibility, it’s important to consider how to construct a distribution that is both fair and effective.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany ICOs and airdrops were suboptimal in that they invited unengaged communities and regulatory scrutiny. Crypto applications that focus on product\u002Fmarket fit have an opportunity to do better, by distributing tokens to an already active user base.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, teams might test a distribution with a managed and permissioned group of community members. A number of teams have elected to do this by allocating a slice of future tokens to early “power” contributors, for example through testnet programs where independent community members can register to participate in operating a node. A promissory and managed token distribution to users that contribute valuable work can help eliminate community dependency on the effort of founding teams.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, teams need to plan how remaining tokens will be distributed to participants, both fairly for past contributions, and effectively as a future incentive for ongoing participation\u003Cb\u003E.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E The distribution design needs to consider the core team that built the product, as well as the users that make it useful. Getting this right is hard, and will always be specific to the application in question, but some common questions to think through are:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWhat percentage of tokens should be allocated to the initial team and cap table?\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHow will you reward different types of contributors to the product or service, historically and in the future?\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHow will technology leadership be rewarded going forward?\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnswering these requires analysis of community behavior, modeling of rational outcomes and workshopping proposals with community members.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Objective 3: Sufficient Decentralization \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you’re a crypto founder and are ready for this stage, that means you have achieved early product\u002Fmarket fit, built a robust community capable of successfully maintaining the application, and mapped out a model that properly incentivizes sustainable operations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow for the last and final step on the journey to sufficient decentralization: a widespread token distribution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn practice, I imagine teams will &#8220;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fhackernoon.com\u002Fstartups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73\"\u003Eexit to the community\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&#8221; by airdropping tokens to users and contributors based on the plan mapped out in the prior objective. This would happen the moment a smart contract is triggered to mint and distribute tokens. Optimally, once this function is triggered a number of things will have happened:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe core team will have ceded majority ownership of the application (fees and control) and mitigated platform risk by ensuring the product is community-owned and operated.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe token may have transmuted to a non-security, given that the service is now sufficiently decentralized — that is, independent of the efforts of a single entity that might have asymmetric information.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe company is sustainable, having retained enough tokens to benefit from fees and growth.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUser-owners realize increasing returns to scale, as the cooperative economics of the service allow for better alignment and growing value (as defined by users rather than shareholders.)\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe spirit of this objective is to mark a specific moment where a crypto product company completes its journey from traditional product team to sustainable community-owned-and-operated network. (Conducting a token distribution always requires careful legal review, and there is little precedent for what I’m describing, so please consult a lawyer first!)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]How to Avoid Getting Stuck\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot of teams have gotten stuck by tackling these objectives in the wrong order, &#8220;faking&#8221; decentralization, or by trying to do everything at once.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, app teams that pursue community ownership first (starting with a wide token distribution) risk engendering a community of speculators, rather than real users. Without a working product, ownership is worthless, and the community won&#8217;t stick. Many teams that have done this are unable to back into product\u002Fmarket fit, and as a result have a hard time kickstarting meaningful community participation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother sequencing risk is jumping straight from early signs of product\u002Fmarket fit to decentralized community ownership (skipping objective 2, community participation.) Failing to formalize \u003Ci\u003Ereal\u003C\u002Fi\u003E community participation can land projects in an uncanny valley of decentralization theater. A symptom of being caught here is an apathetic community with low participation rates, and a heavy dependency on founding teams. In this situation, formalizing control (e.g. through delegation) may be a better path to building trust, whereas hiding under the pretense of decentralization is a quick way to undermine it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to get stuck is to aim to do all three things at once. Lack of focus is the death of most startups, and the same is true for crypto applications. Each of these objectives overlap and needs to be considered holistically, as part of an idea maze, but execution needs to be sequenced and prioritized, not attempted at once.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, it’s worth noting that even if you do the steps in order, once you flip the switch to full community ownership, you&#8217;re in fairly uncharted territory in terms of governing the application. Scaling effective community decision-making is challenging, but if internet communities can accomplish feats like Wikipedia, I&#8217;m optimistic that experimentation and skin-in-the-game (via valuable ownership) can lead to cooperative decision-making at unprecedented scale.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo far, we have yet to see a crypto application execute each of the objectives sequentially, but the most promising project teams I’ve spoken with have been navigating their way through this playbook. Through those conversations, I&#8217;ve come to believe that progressive decentralization offers teams the most auspicious path to finding product\u002Fmarket fit, financial sustainability, a participatory community and regulatory compliance — in that order.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2020\u002F01\u002FScreen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-2.06.12-PM.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-297589 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2020\u002F01\u002FScreen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-2.06.12-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1414\" height=\"1162\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E— \u003C\u002Fi\u003EThanks to Robert Leshner, Hayden Adams, Alexis Gouba, Dan Robinson, Ali Yahya, Denis Nazarov and Toby Shorin for conversations that helped me think through these ideas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
