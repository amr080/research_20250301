He’d just spoken to our banker from the local branch down the street, where we’d kept our money for more than a decade. The bank had frozen all of our accounts indefinitely. We had no idea why. Our banker was not allowed to tell us anything else. Not even if or how or when we might get our money back. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EMy husband and I are rule followers, so this should have been impossible. And because we grew up in families on tight budgets, we’ve long kept a lot of our money in cash in a bank to be prepared for whatever surprises might arise. But our bank’s decision to freeze our accounts meant we had no access to any of our money at all. It was more than a little frightening. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAt the time, I was working for a crypto company. Was I part of the sweep many banks appear to have done to close out crypto company employees’ bank accounts? I don’t know. Honestly, I don’t think I was important enough. But did working for a crypto company play a role? Probably. Most likely I was caught in one of the hundreds of algorithms that all banks have to design and run to comply with \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fx.com\u002FMinarikLaw\u002Fstatus\u002F1879728496584376473\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Elaws that require banks\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E to help the government identify potential bad guys.

They miss plenty of bad guys. They catch plenty of good guys. And there are virtually no remedies for the harms done to those good guys who are unlucky enough to get caught up by them. Sometimes your account is closed and you can take your money and leave. Other times, as in my case, your account is frozen and the bank goes silent. Sometimes the law does not allow the bank to tell you anything at all. Not even to try to figure out if their algorithm made a mistake. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis happens all the time to Americans, not just those of us in crypto, and often with much scarier or worse outcomes.

In the first 24 hours of panic over what to do after losing access to my bank accounts, I realized I did have some assets somewhere else, an inadvertent emergency fund stored in a much safer place than cash under my mattress: I had bitcoin in a self-custody crypto wallet. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESelf-custody wallets are at the heart of DeFi. It’s not a bank account, or really an account at all. It’s a non-custodial technology service — software that lets you safely and securely store and spend your own money. It’s the digital version of the wallet in your back pocket. You are the one holding and controlling your own money at all times, not a bank or anyone else.  \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EMy self-custody wallet meant that I still had a safe way to access my own assets if I needed them. Access that could not be shut off by a bank’s misapplication of an algorithm. Access that could not be shut off by a government determination that a legal industry was not worthy of traditional banking services. It was a lifeline. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis is not a partisan issue. All Americans need access to safe financial services in order to live our lives. We shouldn’t be at risk of those services being turned off when the government or banks themselves deem whole parts of society unworthy — not unlawful, but unworthy. And now we have the technology to give every American this access, as long as we enable this technology to be built safely and responsibly here. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAmerica’s answer has never before been to shut down promising new tech entirely. We shouldn’t start now. We don’t shut down search engines because you can find bad information through them. We don’t shut down email services because bad guys commit fraud through them. The answer is to tailor regulations to actual risk, rather than force new technology into boxes so ill-fitting they destroy the potential benefits altogether. The answer is to go after the actual bad guys, not the good faith American builders eager to play by the rules. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOtherwise we are punishing every single one of us who deserves access to a safe way to store and use their assets that can’t be arbitrarily taken from them, as well as the builders who choose to create jobs and new industries here, rather than overseas.  \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAs for the end of my story, it took almost two months to get (most of) our money back from my old bank. After countless phone calls and complaints and emails and pleas. The bank wouldn’t let us pick up a check, and they wouldn’t even send the money by certified mail. They sent it by regular mail — where all kinds of financial theft happens, but of course no one wants to shut down the entire postal system because of that. So I sat on our front porch stalking our mailperson’s route until the check arrived, now safely deposited elsewhere.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EI am deeply sympathetic to the fear that new technology can create new risks. I welcome any conversation with anyone who thinks we can’t protect Americans while also building responsible DeFi that makes American lives better. And I’m sharing this very personal story publicly to shine a light on this problem in our traditional financial system that is long overdue for fixing, but also as a reminder of the individual people who can be harmed if we act out of fear and prejudice alone against the unknown.

At their peak, dominant nations dictate the rules of trade, finance, and military power, providing their currency with global credibility and trust.

Overextension — whether through war, costly expansions, or unsustainable social commitments — eventually erodes credibility. The Spanish Real de a Ocho, once backed by vast silver reserves from Latin America, declined as Spain’s mounting debts and economic mismanagement eroded its dominance. The Dutch guilder faded as relentless wars drained the Netherlands’ resources. The French franc, dominant in the 18th and early 19th centuries, weakened under the strain of revolution, Napoleonic wars, and financial mismanagement.

Gold and silver weren’t just valuable because they were scarce, they were also divisible, durable, and portable, making them effective currencies — even without sovereign backing or issuance, much like Bitcoin today. Similarly, China’s early paper money didn’t begin as a government-imposed medium of exchange.

But this oversimplifies reality. What gives fiat money its strength isn’t just legal decree, it’s the government’s ability to enforce taxation and its capacity to meet debt obligations through this power. A currency backed by a state with a strong tax base has intrinsic demand because businesses and individuals need it to settle obligations.

To conduct surveillance on customers and prepare these reports that go into the FinCEN Database, financial institutions and other covered businesses spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on compliance personnel and technology — all to appease regulators who often engage in check-the-box exercises rather than assessing the overall effectiveness of a compliance program. The costs of these programs are passed on to customers in the form of higher banking fees, overly burdensome account opening requirements, and even denial of financial services. This is especially true for low-income customers, who are more likely to transact in cash and have more difficulty proving consistent sources of income. These high compliance costs also pose formidable barriers to entry for smaller financial service providers — including fintech startups — who need to build a business before establishing million-dollar compliance programs.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThere is a better way: Blockchain technologies offer a solution to these problems.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBlockchain transactions are made on shared, public ledgers, which anyone, including law enforcement, can view. While the identity of the transactors is not publicly available on blockchains — as their inherent design protects the identity of users — financial institutions know who their customers are, so they can track which blockchain transactions affect their customers. It also means that the government, with the help of blockchain analytics firms and their own developing methods, can see criminal activity happening in real time without having to know the names of the individuals engaged in the transactions. When the criminal activity touches a financial institution, the government can then submit a subpoena for specific customer records, without having to bulk-collect that data and store it. This approach is more targeted, rather than all-seeing and all-encompassing. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBlockchain-based systems in turn create more security for customers — whose information is not preemptively sent to the government — and they also make for faster, more effective law enforcement investigations.

It’s not a flashy process, but it’s designed to ensure fairness and thoroughness. By administrative design, rulemaking is a relatively measured and deliberative process. (There’s even a section in most rule releases un-ironically entitled “The Paperwork Reduction Act.”) So it’s curious that a number of recent rules proposed under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler have sought extension to crypto assets and crypto markets, seemingly without any discussion or deliberation on how they would apply. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe SEC has frequently been criticized for its crypto-related “regulation by enforcement” over the years, but what’s less appreciated is how its “rulemaking by extension” — taking rules developed for other markets or products and applying them wholesale to new areas of technology — has been equally counterproductive. Rules for traditional securities markets often don’t align with crypto; the uniqueness of blockchain technologies warrants its own considerations. Now, there’s an opportunity for the Commission to adopt a bespoke approach to rulemaking that will help the technology thrive while protecting investors and consumers. (Except where Congress has expressed an intent to legislate — including on some matters relating to decentralized finance, or, DeFi — the agency should postpone relevant rulemaking.) \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe new administration at the SEC can address existing shortcomings by reexamining proposed rules. These include the Best Execution Rule for broker-dealers, the Safeguarding Rule for registered investment advisers, and the proposal to amend the definition of an “exchange.” These rules are primarily concerned with the regulation of traditional securities markets and market intermediaries. Yet, as proposed, all of these rules note that they would also apply to “crypto asset securities” and entities that transact in “crypto asset securities.” \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis approach fails in three aspects. First, it is based on the premise that &#8220;crypto asset securities” is a clear and well understood term. Although a tokenized version of a traditional security, such as a stock or bond, would fall within the SEC’s regulatory jurisdiction, it is much less clear when other forms of crypto assets represent securities within the SEC sphere. Proposing rules without providing clarity as to their reach or limit is a terrible practice. The proposed rules also are lacking in that they have not taken into account how crypto assets that are securities, such as tokenized equities or bonds, differ from non-crypto based securities. These differences need to be reflected in any new rulemaking if they are to be effective. In other words, on the surface these rules, designed to provide investor protections in familiar contexts, like broker-dealer order routing or asset custody — need to be carefully tailored to work with respect to this new asset class with unique features. The best way to approach this tailoring reveals the third problem in the rules as proposed — they have not been based on market data and industry input, both of which are essential to ensuring the rules work operationally.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOtherwise?

At its core, the proposal aims to ensure registered investment advisers (RIAs) properly safeguard client assets, including crypto. Sounds fair, right? But the way it’s written makes one thing clear: It’s about making custody in the crypto space commercially impracticable. Instead of being principals-based and allowing knowledgeable fiduciaries to design appropriate procedures (as is the case under much of the Investment Advisers Act), the proposed rule all but ensures that \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2023\u002F05\u002Fa16z-Safeguarding-Rule-Comment-Letter.pdf\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ERIAs won’t even bother trying\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E.  (For example, under the proposal an RIA could not legally purchase a crypto asset if custodians do not offer safeguarding services for that particular asset. Should there exist a qualified custodian that can hold the asset for the RIA, then the RIA [really, its clients] must forgo making productive use of the asset [voting or staking] while it sits idle in the portfolio.) It does the same for banks too, preventing them from doing what they do best: determining how best to safeguard assets.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe SEC would be better served by taking a different approach. Rather than suffocating custody solutions for crypto, why not offer clear guidance on how to establish safeguarding controls tailored for this unique asset class? Crypto isn’t traditional — it comes with challenges like the management of private keys, decentralized platforms, and constantly evolving technologies. But these challenges are surmountable, and regulators could work with industry leaders to craft a framework that protects investors without squelching an asset class.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ELet’s consider another example. The SEC’s proposed Best Execution Rule primarily seeks to establish a best execution standard for broker-dealers. The proposed rule focuses on the regulation of order routing practices in traditional securities markets and on payment-for-order-flow arrangements, but it also observes that it “would apply to all securities, including any digital asset that is a security or a government security under the Federal securities laws.” Despite this, the SEC provides no evidence to suggest that payment-for-order-flow is as prevalent in crypto markets as it is in traditional securities markets. Nor does the SEC even consider that direct retail participation in the crypto markets is far more significant than in traditional securities markets — meaning that brokers play a very different role in crypto markets. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EMost puzzling of all is that the SEC does not even consider what “best execution” might mean in the context of crypto markets, making compliance with the proposed rule nearly impossible. Should a broker-dealer seek execution on the best regulated crypto asset market? Or should it seek execution on the deepest crypto asset markets, irrespective of that market’s regulatory status? Should a broker-dealer consider only the universe of U.S. domiciled crypto asset markets when seeking to identify the best market? Or should it consider all crypto asset markets, irrespective of location? The proposal provides no answer, just the blanket application of rules that were designed for an entirely different system and do not have an obvious application to transactions in crypto assets.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFinally, let’s consider the SEC’s proposal to redefine the term “exchange” under Securities Exchange Act Rule 3b-16. The proposal has been so controversial that it was opened for comment three times over two years. For context, ordinary proposals will be opened only once by the SEC prior to rule adoption. The initial proposal ignored crypto asset markets altogether. Then over a year later, the SEC re-proposed the rule with a supplement noting that the proposed revisions would apply to all crypto exchanges, centralized and decentralized. Amazingly, the SEC noted in that proposal that it lacked data on both crypto asset securities as well as crypto asset trading platforms, yet it went ahead with some crypto-focused revisions anyway. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ERather than forcing ill-fitting rules onto crypto, the SEC should reconsider its misguided approach. It should start with the assumption that rules for traditional securities markets don’t apply to crypto, unless explicitly stated otherwise. It should gather data and collaborate with industry experts to understand the unique features of the assets and the technologies so that it can craft a regulatory framework specifically suited to them. And while not giving the crypto industry a free pass, it should recognize that it already has powerful tools, like Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, to address fraud and manipulation. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EA bespoke approach to rulemaking is superior. After the financial crisis, the SEC adopted a tailored approach to regulating security-based swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, SEC rules exempted swaps and swap market participants from some registration requirements as the regulator learned how these markets work and adapted its approach to more appropriately handle the unique risks of these instruments. This allowed the SEC to tailor specific rules to the contours of swap trading while still retaining the power to address fraud and manipulation.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhile the SEC’s campaign of “regulation by enforcement” has attracted the most attention in recent years, its “rulemaking by extension” has also been damaging. Hopefully, the new leadership at the SEC will adopt an approach where new instruments, technologies, and new business models are regulated with clarity and on terms that accommodate innovation. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EScott Walker\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E is Chief Compliance Officer at Andreessen Horowitz.

Stablecoins are digital assets whose designer pegs their price to another reference asset, typically a currency like the U.S. dollar.

(How the underlying assets can be redeemed by repaying \u002F burning the associated stablecoin depends on every protocol’s specific architecture and governance.) The optimal nature of these backing mechanisms, however, remains an open question.

Tokenization may sound like some kind of mysterious alchemy, but the concept is simple: It means “creating a digital representation of” some physical thing — a stock, bond, commodity, or other asset — in a database, usually a blockchain or distributed ledger. The token serves as a financial record.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EHowever, most of these projects either have launched outside the U.S., or have been forced to limit their operations to cut off the world of digital finance from the rest of the financial ecosystem. U.S. regulators have to date mostly failed to appreciate the many benefits of tokenization, and so have enforced artificial and arbitrary distinctions that effectively disallow it in traditional finance. In the past few years the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has drawn hard and fast lines between tokens and other assets. It has done this even though its own pre-existing regulatory frameworks around financial recordkeeping would otherwise allow it. The time is now to remove these flawed and untenable restrictions in place of appropriate measures.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFinancial records have taken various forms over the years, from written ledgers to tapes to electronic systems. As recently as a few years ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required brokers to maintain their electronic records “exclusively in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format” — a permanent record, in other words. Firms were forced to maintain a mirror set of records on obsolete media such as tapes and optical disks for official purposes even as they kept books and records for actual use in modern formats, like cloud storage. It was wasteful and backwards.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ETo the SEC’s credit, it amended the record keeping rules in January 2023. The change permitted firms to use electronic records as long as the systems provided for a complete audit trail, enabling original records to be recreated even if modified or deleted. There was no specific requirement for the type of database in which these records must be stored, as long as the audit trail requirements were met. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ETheoretically, this should have opened the door to using the latest and most sophisticated technologies available — including blockchains and distributed ledgers. The benefits of such systems — advancing liquidity, reducing counterparty risk and trade failures, and creating efficiencies across markets — make them a compelling choice. Through blockchains, outdated systems could be replaced with technologies that streamline the process of execution and clearing of trades. Arcane and completely unnecessary registered entities such as transfer agents could be cut out entirely. Data reconciliation could occur automatically by connecting the systems of various financial intermediaries. And reporting could be automated by including self-regulatory organizations as observers. Indeed, what better audit trail than an indelible blockchain that shows a record of all transactions? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut U.S. regulators haven’t seen it this way. Through informal guidance and statements (rather than formal rulemaking and legislation), they have severely curtailed the adoption of blockchains and distributed ledger technologies across the financial industry. For example, a joint statement issued by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in 2019 effectively prohibited registered broker-dealers from holding tokenized securities on behalf of customers. Their statement said that it may be impossible for broker-dealers to establish that they have “control” over tokenized securities, making it infeasible to comply with customer protection rules. They cited the risks of fraud and theft as well as information security risks. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis prohibition misses the mark. Financial institutions already all use digital records to evidence possession or control. Paper stock certificates have been obsolete since the paperwork crisis of the 1960s and, since then, various institutions in the chain of custody have represented interests in securities through ledger entries. The concerns about tokenized securities cited by the regulators — potential loss of private keys or misdirected transfers — are technical considerations similar to those associated with the transformation of markets to digital records, and these technical considerations already have many solutions in the marketplace. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe 2019 guidance seems to posit that tokenized securities are different in character from securities whose records are maintained in non-distributed ledgers. No one would think to view these non-distributed records as separate assets from the rights in the shares themselves, or that these records are somehow regulated differently from the shares. Ownership rights in securities can be recorded in written or electronic form, but the ink or computer code does not replace the rights; if a copy of a ledger is made, the owner of an asset listed on the ledger does not suddenly have an entitlement to twice the number of securities that it did before. Just so, it does not appear necessary to regulate the tokenized representation of a security as anything different from the security itself. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIf not for U.S. regulators’ somewhat recent artificial and arbitrary restrictions, existing regulatory frameworks would already allow financial industry participants to use blockchains to record transactions in traditional assets — securities in particular — without thinking of digital tokens as separate from the assets they represent. While the SEC has allowed a narrow subset of broker-dealers to maintain blockchain-based records through guidance issued in 2021, this guidance is extremely narrow, limited to broker-dealers who deal only in digital asset securities. Most large broker-dealers deal in many types of securities and have legacy recordkeeping systems that would need to be transitioned to blockchain-based systems over time. The SEC’s current guidance precludes that from happening. It’s unsurprising therefore that pilot projects relating to blockchain-based securities records have taken place in the UK, the EU and Singapore…but not the United States.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhile the full realization of the initial dream of blockchains in finance may be years off, there is no reason for the industry to subject itself to additional regulatory impairments when the legal infrastructure already exists to support the recording of asset transactions onchain. Assets are just assets, regardless of their material qualities. How their records are kept should mostly be a matter of housekeeping, with the most advantageous technology prevailing.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EJenny Cieplak\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E is a partner at Latham &amp; Watkins LLP who advises fintech and financial services clients on the development and deployment of new technologies.

Money-transmitting businesses are subject to certain registration and information-reporting provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 5312, and a criminal code provision punishing people for failing to register their business, 18 U.S.C. § 1960. The penalties are extraordinarily harsh: Section 1960 subjects violators up to $250,000 in fines and up to five years in prison.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EClarifying and codifying a correct interpretation of money transmission law necessarily involves incorporating concepts of custody and control into the law itself. This also means ensuring government entities consistently interpret the law in a way that incorporates those concepts. We believe this issue is the most critical one facing the industry in the United States because, left unaddressed, the DOJ can continue to accuse developers of non-custodial software — be it a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, the bitcoin protocol, or a similar neutral protocol — of running “unlicensed money transmitting businesses,” even where the allegation makes no sense because those developers have no control over the software or user assets. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe definitions of the terms relating to “money transmission” should leave no doubt about their correct interpretation.

Take a person swapping digital assets: The person can use the services of a centralized exchange business or DeFi protocols to do so. To use a centralized exchange, the person first transfers their digital assets to the exchange, after which the exchange has custody of and exercises control over those assets. The exchange, in turn, effectuates transactions on behalf of the person at that person’s direction. In other words, the exchange “accepts” and “transmits” a user’s funds on the user’s behalf. The centralized exchange’s control over the person’s funds presents certain risks (e.g., loss and misuse) —and policy responses targeting what it can and cannot do with that control can mitigate those risks. In the event the centralized exchange loses the assets they’re controlling on behalf of the person, the exchange should be on the hook.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIn DeFi, the person can accomplish a similar result but without having to cede control over their assets to a third party. When using a decentralized software protocol to exchange digital assets, a person retains control over their digital assets and never cedes that control. Instead, the person uses a novel kind of software tool — a DeFi exchange protocol — to unilaterally conduct the exchange on their own, at their own direction. And unlike the centralized exchange business, the original developer of a DeFi protocol does not retain control over the protocol or have the ability to control how third-parties use it. Only the users of a DeFi protocol exercise control over their own assets. And while there are risks associated with using a DeFi protocol (e.g., it can be complicated technology with higher instances of user error), there is less risk that a third party will lose user funds because the user never gives up custody in the first place. (The bank going down isn’t a risk to you if you’re holding on to your own assets yourself.)\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EA basic understanding of control — in this case, the ability of a third party to actually move funds belonging to the user — is key here. It’s why a centralized exchange business, like the one described above, is appropriately regulated as a “money transmitting” business while the developers of an immutable, non-custodial smart contract protocol are not. It also highlights the perils of improperly understanding and misattributing control. To identify and mitigate sources of risk, on the one hand, and to properly assign liability when things go wrong, on the other hand, requires either identifying who has the necessary control over a system to mitigate risks or who is most responsible for some action in need of redress.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIndustry and lawmakers must come together in 2025 to ensure the law properly reflects accurate concepts of custody and control and the responsibilities that flow from it — whether that’s in the context of a market structure bill, broker reporting obligations, or in reforming Section 1960. At the moment, the industry faces a real threat from the DOJ’s overbroad and erroneous interpretation of what constitutes an unlicensed money transmitting business, one of many misunderstandings that exist all across the crypto policy landscape. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAs we saw in the analogy above, the automobile likely would not have succeeded if carmakers were held liable for every collision outside of their control.

Despite the clear benefits and growth of these networks, the SEC has asserted that some staking as a service business models constitute an investment activity or contract under U.S. securities laws. In-line with former Chairman Gary Gensler’s unfortunate and misguided “regulation by enforcement” approach, a number of SEC enforcement actions have in many instances chilled or halted staking models, thereby harming individuals across the country who seek to support decentralized blockchain protocols.

Proof-of-stake blockchains allow all token holders to participate in maintaining and securing the network.

and comprehensive regulatory framework for decentralized open-source systems remains a challenge, as it requires the effective tailoring of various legislative and policy initiatives within existing laws across the entire U.S. regulatory framework.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the complexity of the tax code and innovative organizational structures essential to decentralized systems, it is no surprise that policymakers have struggled to effectively establish clear rules regarding the reporting requirements and tax treatment of digital assets.  However, this legislative session provides a historic opportunity to reclaim leadership in a technology that’s reshaping global finance, as well as the future of the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 2025 expiration of numerous provisions of the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.irs.gov\u002Fnewsroom\u002Ftax-cuts-and-jobs-act-a-comparison-for-businesses\"\u003ETax Cuts and Jobs Act\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (TCJA) have set the stage for income tax to be addressed in the first session of the 119\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E Congress.  It is expected that tax legislation will be passed through an expedited process known as reconciliation.  While limited to budgetary items like taxes, spending and the debt limit, reconciliation provides Congress the ability to enact legislation with a simple majority vote.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the most comprehensive tax legislation since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), the extension of the TCJA will be a significant undertaking, which will require multiple Congressional committees to each contribute legislation to address their respective reconciliation instructions, further complicated by President Trump’s wide expansion of tariffs and the expected formation of an External Revenue Service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Republican majority in both the House and Senate has committed to enacting President Trump’s legislative agenda \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.reuters.com\u002Fworld\u002Fus\u002Fus-house-republicans-divided-over-how-pay-trumps-tax-cuts-2025-01-26\u002F?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"\u003Ewhile prioritizing substantial reductions in spending\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.  Although budgetary scoring is likely to be offset by the expected revenue derived from tariffs and spending cuts, for American citizens to realize tangible benefits, enacted policy changes must result in increased domestic production and economic growth within the United States.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPresident Trump’s commitment to the rapidly growing crypto industry, along with targeted legislation, can realize these tangible benefits by addressing lingering uncertainties and incentivizing American industry to remain in America.  In particular, the U.S. should act to protect decentralized finance (DeFi), provide clarity for domestic projects, and provide a pathway for foreign projects to return to the United States.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EProtect decentralized finance (DeFi)\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs disappointing as it was predictable, the final Treasury Regulations providing guidance on tax reporting requirements applicable to certain DeFi platforms released on December 27, 2024, far exceeded the provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobst Act (IIJA).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is entirely appropriate and expected for the Treasury Secretary to be involved in the crafting of legislation relevant to the application of the Internal Revenue Code, after advocating for amended language, having that language be specifically excluded from the legislation and then proceeding as if no amended language was necessary (in this case an exceedingly broad definition of “broker” beyond any existing or proposed meaning), it is utterly indefensible for the Treasury Department and the IRS to proceed with finalized Treasury Regulations flaunting the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fpolicy\u002F2021\u002F12\u002F14\u002Fus-lawmakers-ask-janet-yellen-to-define-broker-for-infrastructure-bill\"\u003Eintent of

to be enacted, but even so, final Treasury Regulations cannot merely be set aside, and a significant amount of time, money and effort will be spent rectifying this unnecessary impediment.  To that end, immediate replacement legislation is being considered, lawsuits have been filed and Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mike Carey have introduced a \u003Ca

being entered into the Federal Registry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELimited to just the final regulations pertaining to DeFi, the CRA does not include the final Treasury Regulations providing reporting procedures for more conventional “custodial brokers,” released on June 28, 2024.  Far from perfect, the “custodial broker” regulations did at least reflect genuine consideration of the comments received and are serviceable final regulations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CRA prevents reissuance of “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcrsreports.congress.gov\u002Fproduct\u002Fpdf\u002FIF\u002FIF10023\"\u003Esubstantially the same form\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” which is typically ameliorated by the affected agency focusing on changing the aspects giving rise to the specific objections.  Currently, the specific objections have not been fully articulated.  However, as the entire final regulations are premised on an interpretation beyond authority granted by Congress, it is unlikely that the specific objections can be addressed through resubmission.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile further study has been recommended on this subject and there are many details to be considered around the upgradeability of smart contracts, enacted legislation should unambiguously state that interaction with smart contract protocols, whether through a front-end or not, should not be considered sufficient intermediation giving rise to tax reporting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ERemove uncertainty for domestic projects\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA number of modest legislative considerations can help to remove lingering uncertainties for domestic projects, thereby fostering U.S. innovation. These could be introduced into the expected taxation legislation and provide significant benefits without requiring stand-alone legislation or significant effort to explain their purpose.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the IRS has provided \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.irs.gov\u002Fbusinesses\u002Fsmall-businesses-self-employed\u002Fdigital-assets\"\u003Esignificant sub-regulatory guidance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that is fairly consistent with first principles analysis and existing law, a general lack of cohesion and consistency in how defined terms are utilized creates significant ambiguity in the application of that guidance.  Simply including more thorough and consistent definitions of activity pertaining to terms like “digital assets,” “airdrops,” and “smart contract protocols” would provide unambiguous guidance in how to apply existing tax law, which can easily be accomplished in the expected 2025 legislation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, given the scope of the provisions under review, legislative developments should be monitored for appropriate additions of items like the electability of mark-to-market method for dealers and traders of digital assets, exclusion of income earned from proof-of-stake delegation to third party validators from unrelated business taxable income and clarification that wrapping tokens to enhance functionality is not a realization event if the custodian has no right to transfer the underlying cryptocurrency and the value of the wrapped token is pegged to that of the original token.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, as Congress considers the particular merits of each provision of the TCJA, a number of broader tax considerations could have a direct impact on the taxation of digital assets and the crypto industry, and any such provision should be monitored to ensure that the provision is inclusive of digital assets and the crypto industry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, provisions like the Domestic Production Activities Deduction (DPAD) and the deductibility of casualty and theft loss were removed from the original TCJA – however, both have been mentioned as possibly being included in the tax legislation around extending the expiring provisions of the TCJA.  DPAD is the likely vehicle for President Trump to enact a favorable rate of taxation for domestic production, and it is particularly likely to be at least considered within the upcoming tax legislation.  As the purpose of DPAD is to promote domestic production that includes software development, if measures to include DPAD were to be undertaken, any limitations on software development to exclude the crypto industry should be addressed as the legislation evolves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EProvide a pathway for offshore projects to return to the U.S.\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe opportunity to finally resolve the confusion surrounding the classification of digital assets under securities laws with market structure legislation will allow the industry to finally move past the specter of former chairman Gary Gensler’s SEC and provide a clear path for new blockchain projects to form in the United States.  Unfortunately, legislative solutions are likely necessary to address the tax ramifications for projects wishing to form in the United States that already utilized offshore foundations (a practice involving significant risk and in their typical utilization, necessitated delegation of authority away from decentralized governance mechanisms in favor of centralized boards, counter to crypto’s ethos of decentralization).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile unlikely to be persuasive as a singular issue within President Trump’s commitment to foster domestic production and incentivize operational activity within the United States, the original TCJA provided provisions for repatriation of offshore assets for multinational corporations that could potentially be widened should the domestication of foreign businesses become a legislative priority.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EConclusion\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe success of crypto is not dependent on special treatment under the law.  The technological and societal benefits of blockchain technology is neither dependent on the outcome of political elections nor on the actions of government to succeed.  However, for that success to continue to be an \u003Cem\u003EAmerican\u003C\u002Fem\u003E success, Congress must enact rules that apply fairly to crypto and apply uniformly across all industries.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 2025 legislative window offers a last chance to align rules with technological reality.  Congress must choose: Will America write the playbook for the

Decentralization is actually at the heart of many issues dominating our conversations &#8212; whether it’s about who controls social media networks that influence our public discourse; who financial institutions choose to bank; who controls the AI tools that help us, but that can also generate bots and deepfakes; and other concerns.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does “decentralization” come in?

The same can be said of governments. This is why centralization and consolidation are the norm today: See Big Government, Big Banks, Big Tech, and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch like gravity, centralization is a force that’s hard to resist. By comparison, decentralization &#8212; transferring control and power to distributed groups &#8212; is inefficient.

It’s been hard to pull off in practice, however, because the technologies to coordinate at scale haven’t been possible (or available to all).

Decentralization means asking entrepreneurs and developers to give up control of their projects and proceed by consensus, rather than by singular command-and-control. Decentralization means builders, creators, and investors  distribute ownership to other network participants, thereby diluting their own economic interest. Decentralization means actively inviting third-parties to build out a given network, thereby reducing the founders’ own importance, standing, and singular vision. All of these forces push against decentralization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the easiest and cheapest path to building with blockchain technology is to take shortcuts &#8212; or skip decentralization altogether.

The test requires that for a national securities exchange, such as NYSE or NASDAQ to trade a commodity-based ETP, the listing exchange must have a surveillance agreement with a “regulated market of significant size” in either the commodity or a derivative thereof. Given that the SEC does not consider crypto trading platforms to be “regulated markets,” this functionally means that ETPs can only exist for those crypto assets that have futures markets (regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) which have demonstratively high predictive price discovery of the underlying commodity. This approach overlooks the significant size and transparency of current crypto markets. More importantly, it creates an arbitrary distinction in the standards applicable to crypto-based ETP listing applications and all other commodity-based listing applications.

While it may sound technical, decentralization is the core premise of blockchain technologies. The \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fwhy-decentralization-matters-builders\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebenefits\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of decentralization include promoting competition, creativity, and collaboration while protecting freedom and value &#8212; both financial and reputational.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut why should decentralization be enshrined in law? By adopting policies that incentivize it, we can ensure three important outcomes:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we can guard against the big, centralized companies &#8212; from Big Tech, Big Finance, and Big Entertainment &#8212; entrenching their dominance in the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem. As we’ve seen across internet, banking, and entertainment networks, centralized control has led to consolidation and value extraction to the detriment of the people who use those products. The next iteration of the internet should focus on uplifting those in Little Tech, because the world needs more options, not the same few options.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, we can ensure founders and builders are rewarded for giving up unilateral control and for creating systems that function more like public infrastructure, and less like proprietary technologies. The internet rapidly evolved because entrepreneurs could build on top of shared, open protocols like email and the web. Blockchains unlock a similar, but even more expansive, world of possibilities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we can protect consumers and promote long-term investment and building. Minimum standards of decentralization would push digital assets to function more like commodities than securities, helping to guard against volatility, scams, and the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fblockchain-culture-computer-vs-casino\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecasino culture\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of pump-and-dump schemes &#8212; without stifling innovation.

Even though blockchains now make decentralization more technically possible and easier to implement at scale, it’s still far too convenient for builders to make unilateral decisions, rather than build consensus; and it’s tempting to hoard profits for a few, rather than distribute them among a community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how do we incentivize decentralization?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need a new “fit for purpose” regulatory framework for decentralized technologies like blockchains &#8212; one that isn’t predicated on the existence of centralized intermediaries, the way securities laws currently require. Such a framework could incentivize decentralization by reducing regulatory burdens; and by enabling broader market access for projects that both disseminate ownership \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C\u002Fem\u003E control as well as provide tailored disclosures.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis approach is not new &#8212; it builds on the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fabout\u002Fdivisions-offices\u002Fdivision-corporation-finance\u002Fframework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESEC’s 2019 Framework for Digital Assets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E &#8212; but it also solves one of the key paradoxes that framework had introduced. The framework sought to mitigate risks to users by limiting reliance on centralized actors. But, it also incentivized projects to obfuscate their ongoing development efforts &#8212; or to even abandon work altogether &#8212; exposing users to significant risks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy reframing decentralization in terms of control &#8212; and combining control-related decentralization requirements with disclosure requirements &#8212; this new regulatory framework would empower founders to build decentralized technologies, helping them resist the convenience and ease of centralization. And it would do so without exposing consumers to the risks securities laws aim to address.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis approach would also be malleable enough to evolve as the industry grows. It therefore fosters innovation, accelerates the progress of decentralized technologies, and enables the crypto ecosystem to thrive in the U.S. over the years to come.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere will obviously be pushback from those in the industry looking to advance their own agendas and gains &#8212; but let’s not lose sight of the benefits of blockchain technologies, not just for crypto users, but for all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we win the battle for decentralization, we can defend the purpose of crypto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMiles Jennings is general counsel of a16z crypto.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis post first appeared \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fopinion\u002F2024\u002F12\u002F17\u002Fdecentralization-is-why-we-fight-for-crypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eon Coindesk\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEditors: Paul Cafiero and Sonal Chokshi;

But it does mean that we have to do the hard work of understanding how to staunch the flow of illicit crypto activity. The good news is that thanks to the transparency and auditability of most blockchain transactions, blockchain analytics firms and law enforcement agencies have already done much of this hard work. We know, for instance, that the bulk of illicit financial activity in the crypto ecosystem moves through just a handful of exchanges in jurisdictions with weak or non-existent anti-money laundering regimes. We also know that this activity is performed by foreign actors who typically cannot be reached through existing U.S. enforcement mechanisms. For this reason, introducing laws that would attempt to regulate peer-to-peer transactions between private individuals in the same way we regulate banks and other financial intermediaries would ultimately not address the core issues. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo what should the U.S. government do instead?

An explicit grant of extraterritorial jurisdiction would make it crystal clear that Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) can regulate foreign transactions that impact U.S. markets. OFAC could then take action against entities that have established relationships with U.S. businesses that operate abroad, or those that provide services to U.S. residents. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis change could prevent virtual asset service providers and covered digital asset platforms from locating abroad and engaging in jurisdictional arbitrage to avoid regulations.

It would allow authorities to pursue bad foreign actors more aggressively.

Law enforcement became more effective once specialized cyber forensic tools became broadly available, and when their employees were trained to use them.

At its inception, Ethereum was created and financed by a combination of founders and investors. The prominent role of these creators and supporters caused some to question that the original distribution of Ether formed part of an investment contract, thus a security under federal law. Over time, the role of these early participants diminished and the development of the Ethereum blockchain became diffuse. Today it rests in the hands of its user community. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAn asset’s status as a security or a non-security affects the way it is regulated. Ether being a non-security makes it more like other commodities, like oil, that have no central owner and operator. If Ether were a security that would subject it and transactions in ETH to a panoply of compliance and ongoing disclosure requirements. Worse yet, it is unclear how Ethereum could even comply with those rules given that it is a decentralized open source project with many contributors and no single party in control. Those impossible-to-meet obligations could have severely jeopardized the promise of Ethereum and other blockchain-based technologies.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe ETP listings indicate that the SEC has reevaluated the status of Ether, whatever the circumstances around its launch may have been.

Occasionally, issuers will do this to be able to market their products as funds subject to the additional protections of the ‘40 Act.)\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EGoing deeper: Crypto ETPs\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBitcoin vs. Ethereum: What’s in a BTC ETP vs. ETH ETP?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBitcoin and Ether are two of the most prominent digital assets, yet they serve fundamentally different purposes. BTC is primarily a unit of exchange or account on a distributed ledger, functioning as a decentralized digital currency. Its primary utility is its ability to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBy contrast, ETH acts as a unit of compute within a global virtual computer known as the Ethereum network. This network supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), enabling a wide range of functionalities beyond value transfer. Consequently, while both BTC and ETH are important to the digital asset ecosystem, their differing utilities underscore their unique roles and potential applications.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhat are the advantages of ETH ETPs?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFor crypto assets, some of the traditional advantages of ETPs may not exist. For instance, direct holders of ETH have 24&#215;7 liquidity in crypto markets and can maintain direct control of the asset. Some buyers, particularly buyers new to crypto, may be more comfortable with owning ETPs than owning their assets in wallets or crypto custodial arrangements. Although exchanges on which ETP shares trade are often deeper than markets for the asset(s) underlying the ETP, it remains to be seen whether ETH and other crypto-based ETPs will enjoy markets of comparable or better depth than those found on today&#8217;s crypto trading platforms. Additionally, for reasons discussed below, the ETP shares may trade at a discount to ETH due to certain operational limitations placed on the ETPs.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EEven so, ETP products for ETH can expand the market of potential buyers and sellers of ETH to fiduciaries that would otherwise be precluded due to myriad reasons including, investment restrictions or compliance considerations. Holding assets through an ETP can significantly reduce the complications associated with managing and safeguarding assets. For example, while holding crypto can be technologically complex for some investors and consumers, ETPs provide individuals the option to have a regulated institution manage custody for them while investing in the asset class. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhat are the disadvantages of BTC and ETH ETPs?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOne limitation placed on the ETH and BTC ETPs is that, unlike most other ETP products, one mechanism by which the trading price of the ETP is kept in line with the market value of the underlying asset is constrained. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EUnder the SEC orders for ETH ETPs, buyers cannot bring the underlying ETP assets to the trust and request ETP shares in exchange, and sellers cannot request redemptions of ETP shares they acquire in the market and receive underlying assets. Under the SEC ETH orders, the creation and redemption of ETP shares can only settle for cash. Although this is not important to most individual investors, this limitation on institutions maintaining liquidity when there are buy and sell excesses in the arbitrage process may subject the issuer to inefficiency as it attempts to acquire or dispose of underlying assets. Given the volatility in crypto prices, this extra step may result in spreads between the ETP price and the value of the asset that it is designed to track. This unfortunate limitation may lessen the attractiveness of the ETP product as a way to gain exposure to this asset class.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EHow do ETH ETPs deal with staking?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EETH ETPs have another quirk: the SEC orders approving them contain a prohibition against “staking,” the process for securing the blockchain, which in return dispenses rewards. This is a right that direct holders of the asset can exercise. ETH ETP owners are now exposed to the underlying ETH asset but precluded from earning any additional ETH through staking rewards. This prohibition on staking may complicate the arbitrage process described above and could be considered a “bug” of holding the ETH ETP, rather than owning ETH directly, depending on the investors’ views.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOn the one hand, eliminating staking could be considered a “feature” as it simplifies some aspects of the ETPs, including reducing technical complexity, liquidity constraints, and the risk of slashing, the loss of ETH due to computational misconduct. On the other hand, being able to stake ETH that is directly held, can provide a source of income and defray carrying costs of the investment. It will be interesting to follow the pricing implications to ETH ETPs of the prohibition on staking ETP-held ETH. If the foregone income is reflected in a discount in the pricing of ETP units, some investors may prefer holding ETH ETPs to holding ETH directly. In other words they may find the discount more attractive than the potential staking returns which, as described above, come with some complications.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EA second-order effect of the staking prohibition is that it could cause network security issues to the extent that an outsized portion of all ETH is locked in the ETP and prohibited from staking. Although unlikely, this would result in a smaller (relatively speaking) set of holders of ETH that validate transactions in ETH and could provide that group disproportionate influence.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhat’s more advantageous: ETH ETPs or directly holding ETH?\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EInvestors can weigh the convenience and accessibility of holding ETPs against the benefits of direct ownership.

Which alternative they choose will depend on each of their own assessments of the factors outlined above and whether they intend to use ETH for its computational purposes.

But it also created the conditions for new and more powerful intermediaries to emerge — from marketplaces and payments, to messaging and social media, the creator economy, and so on. Propelled by the need to monetize the fast-growing networks they created, internet-based intermediaries proceeded to limit interoperability and constrained consumers and businesses within their walled gardens.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EToday, those garden walls define how businesses surface products to their customers, how developers distribute their apps, how we interact with our social network, how creators connect to their audiences, and a lot more. By controlling not only access but also the underlying data and the algorithms that rank results and match buyers and sellers, each one of these platforms shapes how society allocates attention, effort, and money.

The first sees blockchains as a way to build new networks. I call this culture the computer because, at its core, it’s about blockchains powering a new computing movement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other culture is mainly interested in speculation and money-making. Those of this mindset see blockchains solely as a way to create new tokens for trading. I call this culture the casino because, at its core, it’s really just about gambling.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMedia coverage exacerbates confusion over the two cultures. Tales of fortunes won and lost are dramatic, easy to explain, and attention-grabbing. In contrast, the technology story is nuanced, slow to develop, and requires historical context to understand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECasino culture is problematic — and, in the extreme case of the defunct offshore exchange FTX, it’s outright destructive. It takes tokens out of context, wraps them in marketing language, and encourages speculation in them. Whereas responsible token exchanges provide useful services, such as custody, staking, and market liquidity, reckless ones encourage bad behavior and play fast and loose with people’s money. At worst, they’re outright Ponzi schemes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that the fundamental goals of regulators and of blockchain builders are ultimately aligned. Securities laws try to eliminate pockets of asymmetric information with respect to publicly traded securities, thereby minimizing the trust that market participants need to place in management teams. Blockchain builders also try to eliminate centralized pockets of economic and governance power, thereby reducing the amount of trust users must place in other network actors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of this writing, the last time the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the main regulator of the U.S. securities markets, gave substantive guidance on the topic was in 2019. The agency has since brought several enforcement actions alleging that certain transactions of tokens were subject to securities laws, and it has done so without providing further clarification about the criteria by which it makes these determinations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EApplying pre-internet legal precedents to modern networks leaves gray areas that provide significant advantages to bad actors and non-U.S. companies that don’t follow U.S. rules. The situation today is so complex that regulators themselves can’t agree where to draw the line. For example, the SEC has suggested that Ethereum’s token is a security, but the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the primary U.S. regulator of commodities, has said that it is a commodity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EOwnership and Markets Are Inextricable\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome policymakers have proposed rules that would effectively ban tokens and therefore, for all practical purposes, blockchains. If tokens were purely for speculation, these proposals might be justified. But speculation is just a side effect of tokens’ true purpose as essential tools that enable community-owned networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause tokens can, like all ownable things, be traded, it is easy to think of them as purely financial assets. Properly designed tokens have specific uses, including as native tokens that incentivize network development and power virtual economies. Tokens are not a sideshow of blockchain networks, a nuisance that can be stripped out and discarded. They are a necessary and central feature. Community ownership doesn’t work unless communities have a way to own.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes people ask if it’s possible to get the benefits of blockchains while removing any hint of the casino by making tokens impossible to trade, through either legal or technical means. If you remove the ability to buy or sell something, however, you remove ownership. Even intangibles, like copyrights and intellectual property, can be bought and sold at their owners’ discretion. No trading means no ownership; you can’t have one without the other.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne interesting question is whether hybrid approaches can tame the casino while still allowing the computer to be built. One proposal would prohibit token reselling after the debut of a new blockchain network, either for some fixed period or until specified milestones are met. Tokens could still be awarded as incentives to grow the network, but token holders might need to wait several years, or until the network hits certain thresholds, before trading restrictions are lifted.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETime horizons can be a very effective way to align people’s incentives with broader, societal interests. Think of the hype cycle described earlier that technologies go through, with the early hype phase followed by a crash and then the “plateau of productivity.” Long-term restrictions force token holders to weather the hype and its aftermath and to realize value by contributing to productive growth.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe industry needs further regulation, to be clear, and that regulation should focus on achieving policy objectives, like punishing bad actors, protecting consumers, providing stable markets, and encouraging responsible innovation. The stakes are high. As I’ve argued throughout “Read Write Own,” blockchain networks are the only known technology that can reestablish an open, democratic internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ELimited Liability Corporations: A Regulatory Success Story\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory shows that smart regulation can accelerate innovation. Until the mid-nineteenth century, the dominant corporate structure was a partnership. In a partnership, all the shareholders are partners and bear full liability for the actions of the business. If the company has a financial loss or causes nonfinancial harm, the liability pierces the corporate shield and falls on the shareholders. Imagine if shareholders of public companies like IBM and GE were personally liable, beyond any money invested, for mistakes the companies made. Very few people would buy stocks, making it much harder for companies to raise capital.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELimited liability corporations did exist back in the early nineteenth century, but were rare. Forming one required a special legislative act. As a result, almost all business ventures were close-knit partnerships among people who deeply trusted one another, like family members or close friends.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis changed during the railway boom of the 1830s and the period of industrialization that followed. Railroads and other heavy industries required significant up-front capital—more than could be provided by small groups, even when the groups were very wealthy. New and broadened sources of capital were needed to fund a transformation of the world economy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you might expect, the upheaval ignited controversy. Lawmakers faced pressure to make limited liability the new corporate standard. Meanwhile, skeptics argued that expanding limited liability would encourage reckless behavior, effectively transferring risk from shareholders to customers and society at large.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the factions settled on a way forward. Industry and lawmakers crafted sensible compromises, arranged legal frameworks, and made limited liability the new norm. This led to the creation of public capital markets for stocks and bonds and all the wealth and wonders those innovations have generated since. Thus, technological innovation drove pragmatic changes to regulation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe history of economic participation is one of increasing inclusion thanks to a combination of tech and legal advances. Partnerships had small groups of owners that counted in the tens. The limited liability structure expanded ownership dramatically, to the point that public companies today have millions of shareholders. Blockchain networks, through mechanisms such as airdrops, grants, and contributor rewards, expand the circle once more. Future networks could have billions of owners.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as industrial-era businesses had new organizational needs, so do network-era businesses today. Corporate networks bolt an old legal structure, C-corporations and LLCs and the like, onto a new network structure. This mismatch is the root cause of many of the problems with corporate networks, including their inexorable switchover from attract to extract mode and the exclusion of so many contributors from the upside of their networks. The world needs new, digitally native ways for people to coordinate, cooperate, collaborate, compete.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains provide a sensible organizational structure for networks. Tokens are the natural asset class. Policymakers and industry leaders can work together to find the right guardrails for blockchain networks, just as their forerunners did for limited liability corporations. The rules should permit and encourage decentralization, not default to centralization as corporate entities do. There are many things that can be done to rein in casino culture while allowing computer culture to develop. Hopefully, smart regulators will encourage innovation and let founders do what they do best—build the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe casino should not hold the computer down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis book excerpt, adapted from \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Freadwriteown.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ERead Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eby Chris Dixon, first\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003E appeared on \u003C\u002Fem\u003EFortune&#8217;s \u003Cem\u003Ewebsite on Sunday, March 10, 2024. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

This is no longer the case: networks controlled by the largest tech companies now reach billions, but entrepreneurs and creators have learned just how untrustworthy they can be. These businesses clamp down on application programming interfaces, meddle with mysterious algorithms, and rank content according to opaque and capricious policies. Worse, big tech companies claim most of the revenue that flows through their networks. This stifles creativity, making our online lives poorer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the economics of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Ftags\u002Fnetwork-effects\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enetwork effects\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: companies provide perks and easy-to-use tools to draw in users — and then, once they are locked in, switch to extracting value from them.

First, openness: being available to anyone, anywhere. Second, trust: the rules should be transparent, fair and dependable, so builders, creators and users know the network cannot yank the rug out from under them. Finally, all users — not just centralized gatekeepers — should have a say in the networks they contribute to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworks built on blockchains have all these attributes. While it’s easy to dismiss the technology because of its associations with casino-style gambling behavior — notably FTX and meme coins — it would be a mistake to ignore its potential. Progress towards greater scalability indicates this could be as transformative as the arrival of the PC.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains are a new class of virtual computer that can, for the first time ever, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eestablish inviolable rules in software\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Usually, whoever controls computer hardware can tell the software what to do.

This could potentially revolutionize the internet’s power dynamics.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworks built on blockchains combine the societal benefits of early internet protocol networks (open access, democratic governance, low take rates and user ownership rights) with the competitive advantages of corporate ones (sustainable sources of funding and advanced features).

That’s because wallets are typically created by, and operated via,\u003Ci\u003E someone else’s software or hardware\u003C\u002Fi\u003E. Users constantly put their trust in other people, products, and computer programs.

Whether the wallet is considered custodial or non-custodial, the security properties of the key generation step are paramount to the keys’ safety thereafter. During key generation, there are three overarching concerns to keep in mind: using reliable code, implementing the code properly, and safely handling the output.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you’re not a crypto expert, it can be difficult to verify that all of the following factors are being done by the book.

Same goes for crypto, a science that is hard to get exactly right. The code composing a wallet should have a reputation for working well. Choosing poorly written software – or attempting to develop one’s own alternative \u003Ci\u003Ede novo\u003C\u002Fi\u003E – can lead to mishaps such as key leakage or revealing secret information to unauthorized parties.

Vetted software will typically set up correct parameters by default, but there can be gaps in execution. For instance, a strong source of entropy, or dose of mathematical randomness, is required to make to-be-generated keys unpredictable and, therefore, more secure. For certain key generation processes, such as for many Multi-Party Computation (MPC) algorithms, in which many separate keys – or shards, fragments of keys – must be generated and coordinated, the wallet ought to follow the precise protocol as specified by the algorithm. The algorithm may also require multiple rounds of computation as well as refreshing keys, which the wallet must integrate properly to maintain the security of the funds.\u003Cb\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EUse a wallet that can keep secrets\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe final phase of the key generation process involves the actual operation and output of the software.

When it comes to key storage options, a wallet is considered “hot” if it’s connected to the internet. A wallet is considered “cold,” on the other hand, if it’s offline and isolated. All else being equal, cold wallets are more secure than hot wallets – but they’re also more difficult to access and use. A wallet that is connected to any network is more susceptible to hacks as it allows attackers more chances for access to discover and exploit vulnerabilities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHot wallets can take a few forms.\u003Ci\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConnected software: online databases, phone or web server application memory, browser extensions\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are the riskiest options. Here, the wallet software, custodial or not, has direct access to the keys – all while being connected to the outside internet. The keys should ideally be encrypted, and the other set of keys used to encrypt them should be stored in a dedicated key management system (KMS) with highly restricted access controls such as an operating system keychain or a cloud key management system.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor software-based hot wallets, it is critical to isolate the key management and authorization from the rest of the software components. Problems can crop up in logging, error management, and memory management (especially heap-based, where keys may not be properly “zeroized,” or erased), all of which can mistakenly leak passwords, encryption keys, signing keys, or other sensitive cryptographic material. When that happens, interlopers can gain unauthorized access through connected applications or web servers, side channel attacks, or insider threats.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo matter how a service labels itself, if the signing keys are unencrypted at any time in the online system’s memory, then the model should be considered a hot software wallet.

In connected hardware, keys are generated and live only inside special-purpose hardware devices. These can then be connected either to internal or public networks. Such devices generally take on multiple responsibilities related to key management, including security for key generation, signing, and storage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EConnected hardware comes in several varieties. There are hardware wallets, such as Trezor and Ledger devices, which slightly more sophisticated crypto users commonly use. (Many more people should be using these devices, as they’re vastly safer than using connected software alone.) There are also hardware security modules, or HSMs, which are commonly used in more traditional business settings such as ones that handle sensitive data processing, like credit card payments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDevices are only as safe as the supply chain that produced and configured them. When considering connected hardware, ask yourself: What’s the likelihood that either the devices – or firmware – were tampered with before coming into your possession? To reduce this risk, it’s best to buy devices directly from trusted vendors. Have them shipped directly from the source. Make sure the packages do not appear to be compromised – no rips, tears, broken seals, etc. – which might indicate tampering amid transport. It’s also advisable to verify the firmware version and configuration before use. The steps to do so vary depending on the hardware, but all should provide instructions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there’s always the possibility that a hardware wallet could later be stolen or accessed by an unauthorized party. Given these threats, it’s important to make sure hardware wallets also have secure access control layers – safeguards ensuring they aren’t just blindly signing any and all transactions. Controls can include password requirements, prompts asking for explicit permission for every step of a transaction, and plain English summaries describing what transactions are actually doing. In addition, most hardware wallets support private key encryption, also known as “key wrapping.” Even better, secure wallets will not allow keys to be exported in raw plaintext form, even if one wished for them to be.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the level of safety that is required to truly safeguard crypto assets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]Less risky: “cold” wallets\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELess heat, lower risk. Cold wallets are, all else being equal, generally considered more secure than hot ones, though they’re also generally less usable. Cold wallets are commonly called “airgapped” wallets, meaning they have no connection to any internal or public network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELoneliness is a virtue in this case. Airgapping involves implementing rigorous physical isolation and authorization measures. These measures can include the use of Faraday cages (shields that block wireless signals), biometrics access (like fingerprint or iris scanners), motion sensors (to trip alarms in case of unauthorized use), and SCIFs, or Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (special areas for processing classified information).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s review some cold wallet options in more detail.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAirgrapped software: offline server application\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause an attacker can steal or take a machine online at any time, cold wallets should be designed with security systems that hold up even if they are brought online. Keys should be split in key shards – requiring the pieces to be rejoined to be made usable – through a standard method, such as Shamir’s Secret Sharing or Multi-Party Computation. Special purpose hardware, such as HSMs, are highly recommended over connected software as they generally offer more controls.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAirgrapped hardware: offline hardware wallet, offline hardware security module (HSM)\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis solution is considered the safest of all. Similar to the previous category, one should assume the hardware can be stolen and taken online. For that reason, it’s important again for these systems to include properly implemented access control layers, as discussed earlier. Many HSM vendors require a quorum of physical smartcards to come together before access to keys can be unlocked. Even if the device does not have a display screen, it should offer some way for users to verify the details of transactions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause cold or airgapped wallets are the safest category, most funds managed by big players are stored in this manner. Major retail services, such as Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, and others, as well as services for institutional users such as Anchorage, are among those that do so. Many of these players choose to have another line of defense in the form of backups and recovery, just in case – heaven forbid – they lose access, or machines are corrupted, stolen, or destroyed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]Backups and recovery\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESigning keys should always be backed up after being encrypted. It is critical to have redundancy of both encrypted signing keys and key-wrapping keys. Methods to back up a signing key differ, but one should always prefer hardware native solutions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor hardware wallets, backups usually involve a 12-word plaintext seed phrase from which private keys are derived. This seed phrase should be stored non-digitally (think paper, metal) and in the most secure way available (a physical vault at home, inside a bank vault). The phrase can be split into parts that are geographically distributed to prevent easy compromise of the entire secret. (People sometimes explain this approach by referencing the fictional horcruxes which dark wizards use effectively to “backup” their souls in \u003Ci\u003EHarry Potter\u003C\u002Fi\u003E.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany HSMs natively handle some of the challenges related to backup and recovery. Standard ones have mechanisms that can export keys that are, by default, encrypted with access controls. If the access controls are satisfied, keys can then be imported into other HSMs. Usefully, fleets of HSMs can also be provisioned with a common encryption key, derived from a quorum of smartcards. Decoupling the hardware from the key materials in this manner helps avoid single points of failure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, human factors need addressing. Recovery mechanisms should be able to withstand the temporary or permanent unavailability of any individual involved in account management operations. Individuals should make sure to provide ways for close family members or other trusted parties to recover keys in case of death or other emergencies. Group operations, meanwhile, should define a quorum – such as 2-out-of-3 or 3-out-of-5, say – that can reasonably operate despite life events, travel, illness, or accidents.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\"key-usage\"\u003EKey usage: wallet security\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter keys are generated and stored, they can be used to create digital signatures that authorize transactions.

To reduce risk, wallets should abide by the following guidelines for authorization and authentication.\u003Cb\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETrust, but verify\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWallets should require authentication.

The most common safeguards here are PIN codes or passphrases. As always, these should be sufficiently long and complex – using many different types of characters – to be maximally effective.

Some signature schemes may require a \u003Ci\u003Enonce\u003C\u002Fi\u003E meaning, “number used once,” an arbitrary number only meant to be used, well, once in a system. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is one such signature scheme that does so. If a nonce is reused with ECDSA, it can lead to key compromise. Various other algorithms are not affected so, as usual, make sure well-established cryptographic libraries are being used. (Certain cryptographic libraries ensure unique nonces by hashing transaction data, which include other unique data such as account nonces.) But this attack vector has been exploited before in high-profile hacks outside of web3, such as this 2010 \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.engadget.com\u002F2010-12-29-hackers-obtain-ps3-private-cryptography-key-due-to-epic-programm.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESony PlayStation 3 hack\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003Cb\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EOne key per purpose\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother best practice is avoiding reuse of a key for more than a single purpose.

The principle of “least privilege” can, when properly implemented, drastically limit the blast radius of a successful attack. Different keys will have different requirements for backups and access management depending on their purpose. In the context of web3, it is a best practice to separate keys and seed phrases between assets and wallets, so compromise of one account does not affect any other.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EConclusion\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe custodial or non-custodial nature of key ownership is not so black and white as conventional thinking would have one believe.

For instance, a strong source of entropy, or dose of mathematical randomness, is required to make to-be-generated keys unpredictable and, therefore, more secure. For certain key generation processes, such as for many Multi-Party Computation (MPC) algorithms, in which many separate keys – or shards, fragments of keys – must be generated and coordinated, the wallet ought to follow the precise protocol as specified by the algorithm.

Make sure the packages do not appear to be compromised – no rips, tears, broken seals, etc. – which might indicate tampering amid transport.

Controls can include password requirements, prompts asking for explicit permission for every step of a transaction, and plain English summaries describing what transactions are actually doing.

Standard ones have mechanisms that can export keys that are, by default, encrypted with access controls. If the access controls are satisfied, keys can then be imported into other HSMs. Usefully, fleets of HSMs can also be provisioned with a common encryption key, derived from a quorum of smartcards. Decoupling the hardware from the key materials in this manner helps avoid single points of failure.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFinally, human factors need addressing. Recovery mechanisms should be able to withstand the temporary or permanent unavailability of any individual involved in account management operations. Individuals should make sure to provide ways for close family members or other trusted parties to recover keys in case of death or other emergencies. Group operations, meanwhile, should define a quorum – such as 2-out-of-3 or 3-out-of-5, say – that can reasonably operate despite life events, travel, illness, or accidents.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\"key-usage\"\u003E[toc-embed]Key usage: wallet security\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAfter keys are generated and stored, they can be used to create digital signatures that authorize transactions.

In other words, they should verify that users are who they say they are, and that only authorized parties can access the wallet’s contents. The most common safeguards here are PIN codes or passphrases. As always, these should be sufficiently long and complex – using many different types of characters – to be maximally effective.

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is one such signature scheme that does so. If a nonce is reused with ECDSA, it can lead to key compromise. Various other algorithms are not affected so, as usual, make sure well-established cryptographic libraries are being used. (Certain cryptographic libraries ensure unique nonces by hashing transaction data, which include other unique data such as account nonces.)

The principle of “least privilege” can, when properly implemented, drastically limit the blast radius of a successful attack. Different keys will have different requirements for backups and access management depending on their purpose.

Hatred for spam email is nearly universal, but what would the web of today look like if authorities made it illegal for the email protocol (SMTP) to facilitate the sending of spam? The answer: not good. What constitutes junk email is inherently subjective and changes over time. Massive companies like Google spend fortunes trying to eliminate spam from their email apps or clients (e.g., Gmail) – and they still get it wrong. In addition, even if some authority mandated that SMTP filter spam by default, malicious actors could, because protocols are open source, simply reverse engineer the filter in order to circumvent it.

SMTP enables us to send email to anyone in the world, but if the U.S. required SMTP to filter spam email, we can assume that foreign governments would require similar restrictions. Further, because what constitutes spam is subjective, we can also assume that governments’ requirements would differ. So, even if it were technologically possible to build protocols capable of making complex and subjective decisions, doing so is antithetical to the concept of establishing a standard that is practical on a global scale. It’s simply not possible for SMTP to incorporate the changing spam filter requirements of 195 countries, and even if the protocol could, it wouldn’t know what country users are in and how to prioritize competing determinations with any fairness. Adding subjectivity to protocols destroys one of the pillars that makes them useful: standardization.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ERules are context dependent. In web3, what’s permissible under securities and derivatives laws varies by country, and those laws change all the time. A DEX has no way of establishing a global standard for such laws and, like SMTP, has no way to curtail access based on geography. Ultimately, there’s no way for protocols to be successful if they are required to be built on top of the shifting sands of global regulation.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Avoid these problems by making apps or clients comply\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBy now it should be obvious why it’s critical to regulate apps instead of protocols. App-level regulation can accomplish the goals of governments without jeopardizing the underlying technology. We know this because the approach already works.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EEarly web protocols remain useful after more than 30 years because they continue to be open source, decentralized, autonomous, and standardized. But governments can restrict the information passing through these protocols by regulating apps. Or they can protect the free flow of information, as the U.S. did by approving Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Each country can determine its own approach and the businesses that operate browsers, websites, and applications in their respective jurisdictions are capable of tailoring products to comply with such decisions.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAs the dichotomy between protocols and apps is the same in web3, the regulatory approach to web3 should stay the same. Web3 apps like wallets, webapps, and other applications enable users to deposit digital assets in liquidity pools of lending protocols, to buy NFTs through marketplace protocols, and to trade assets on DEXs. Those wallets, websites, and applications can be regulated in every jurisdiction where they seek to provide access, and it’s reasonable to require them to comply.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe first generation of the web gave us incredible tools in the form of networking, data exchange, email, and file transfer protocols, all of which made it possible to move information at the speed of the internet.

Only a handful of clearly qualified crypto custodians operate in the U.S. – and these few qualified custodians service only a limited number of crypto assets.

Building on the examples already mentioned above: While developers can, in principle, create adventure games around whatever themes and item concepts they want, the fact that many are choosing to develop around Loot bags reflects the community cohesion within the Lootverse. Meanwhile, Blitmap derivative project Flipmap \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fflipmap.art\u002Ffaq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eshared\u003C\u002Fa\u003E part of their revenue with the original Blitmap artists in recognition of that project&#8217;s core position within the community – a move that can promote a healthy culture within a cc0 project ecosystem.

Moreover, while cc0 has some superficial similarity to the strategy of allowing NFT owners specifically to commercialize the intellectual property associated with the NFTs they hold – à la \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fboredapeyachtclub.com\u002F#\u002Fterms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBored Ape Yacht Club\u003C\u002Fa\u003E – there is a crucial difference: cc0 holders don’t have the right to exclude others from using the same IP. This can make it harder for holders to build commercial brands on top of the cc0 asset themselves or grant specific rights to partners – although holders can, of course, still introduce expanded intellectual property (such as backstories or derivatives) that they do completely control.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E*  *  *\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization and open development are core elements of blockchain technologies and the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fweb3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebroader crypto ethos\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

As the NFT space continues to evolve and mature, we expect to see more organized infrastructure and design patterns supporting these efforts. There’s also likely to be innovation around frameworks for value capture, just as there has been with open source software.

And as creators continue to advance the space, we expect to see them develop, and experiment with, novel rights and licensing models far beyond what’s in use today.

If, for example, UrbanOutfitters wanted to put my design on a tee, instead of hiring someone on their team to design something that looks like it, they can just use the actual work.&#8221; Sometimes, adopting cc0 can effectively turn competition into cooperation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, cc0 projects can benefit significantly from community agreement about core assets’ value and contribution. Community cohesion and engagement is essential here. Building on the examples already mentioned above: While developers can, in principle, create adventure games around whatever themes and item concepts they want, the fact that many are choosing to develop around Loot bags reflects the community cohesion within the Lootverse. Meanwhile, Blitmap derivative project Flipmap \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fflipmap.art\u002Ffaq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eshared\u003C\u002Fa\u003E part of their revenue with the original Blitmap artists in recognition of that project&#8217;s core position within the community – a move that can promote a healthy culture within a cc0 project ecosystem.

Moreover, while cc0 has some superficial similarity to the strategy of allowing NFT owners specifically to commercialize the intellectual property associated with the NFTs they hold – à la \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fboredapeyachtclub.com\u002F#\u002Fterms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBored Ape Yacht Club\u003C\u002Fa\u003E – there is a crucial difference: cc0 holders don’t have the right to exclude others from using the same IP. This can make it harder for holders to build commercial brands on top of the cc0 asset themselves or grant specific rights to partners – although holders can, of course, still introduce expanded intellectual property (such as backstories or derivatives) that they do completely control.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E*  *  *\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization and open development are core elements of blockchain technologies and the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fweb3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebroader crypto ethos\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

Some cc0 project leaders, like the creators of Chain Runners, have continued building atop the initial cc0 assets themselves, actively establishing an \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.chainrunners.xyz\u002Fthe-universe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eenvironment\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that derivative projects can plug into and build on top of.

As the NFT space continues to evolve and mature, we expect to see more organized infrastructure and design patterns supporting these efforts. There’s also likely to be innovation around frameworks for value capture, just as there has been with open source software.

And as creators continue to advance the space, we expect to see them develop, and experiment with, novel rights and licensing models far beyond what’s in use today.

There are, broadly speaking, two competing visions for how to bring this about: One is decentralized, generous with property rights and new frontiers, interoperable, open, and owned by the communities that build and maintain it. The other vision — too familiar to many people today — is centralized, closed, subject to the whims of corporations; and often extracts painful economic rents from its creators, contributors, and inhabitants.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe key dimension to compare these two visions is open vs closed, and the differences between them can be conceptualized as follows:\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5824\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002FMetaverse-framework-In-line.jpe\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1254\" \u002F\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAn open metaverse is decentralized, allows users to control identity, enforces property rights, aligns incentives, and ensures value accrues to users (not platforms).

For example, the Domain Name System, the internet’s “phone book”, is controlled by a distributed network of people and organizations, using rules that are created and administered in the open. This means that anyone who adheres to community standards can own a domain name and establish an internet presence. It also means that the power of companies operating web and email hosting is kept in check &#8212; if they misbehave, customers can port their domain names to competing providers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the mid 2000s to the present, trust in open protocols was replaced by trust in corporate management teams. As companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook built software and services that surpassed the capabilities of open protocols, users migrated to these more sophisticated platforms. But their code was proprietary, and their governing principles could change on a whim.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do social networks decide which users to verify or ban?

So what should a 21st century regulator look like? Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Christopher Giancarlo (more about him below) shared the following remarks on how the CFTC has been evolving and crafting a modern regulatory approach at the inaugural a16z Crypto Regulatory Summit &#8212; which brought together leading crypto experts and builders, other technologists, academics, industry executives, and government officials along with forward-thinking regulators to foster collaboration and the exchange of ideas. What are the &#8220;formula&#8221; or four key elements\u002F mindsets involved, how might they inform regulators, and what should entrepreneurs do as a result?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGood Morning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’d like to talk to you about the tension between the current FinTech revolution and our existing financial regulatory structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you know, the digitization of information that took place in the last decades of the 20th century occurred in a regulatory “light” zone of the US Constitution’s protection of speech.  Conversely, the current, early 21st century digitization of finance is taking place in a regulatory “heavy” zone of the long-established authority of U.S. state and federal governments to protect consumers of financial services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, the practices that guided the digitization of information (and that you are all familiar with, such as “don’t ask permission, ask forgiveness”) will not work, as we have seen with initial coin offerings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet, regulation and regulators need to adapt and not be an impenetrable barrier to the current wave of fintech innovation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, I want to explain the four-part model for regulatory adaptation to fintech innovation that we have successfully deployed at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut first, some personal background. I spent a decade and a half practicing law in New York and in London in the 80s and 90s.  And in 2001, I teamed up with a group of entrepreneurs, and we built the world&#8217;s first hybrid electronic trading platform for over-the-counter derivatives. We raised three rounds of private equity. We built trading platforms in 18 financial centers around the world. And in 2005, we took our company public and had one of the most successful IPOs and follow-on offerings of that period of time. And we were doing fintech before anybody had even an idea what fintech was, very successfully, I might add.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008, we had emerged into the world&#8217;s largest trading platform for a type of a derivative traded over the counter called, “credit default swaps”. You may have heard of them &#8211; played a role in the financial crisis. And I want to tell you a story about that, that tells you about a little bit of the junction of markets, regulation and technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn September of 2008, on a Wednesday afternoon, three days before Lehman Brothers failed, I got a call from a senior official of the New York Federal Reserve. And he said to me, &#8220;We&#8217;ve met before, right?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Remind me what you guys do again.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;We&#8217;re the world&#8217;s largest platform for trading credit default swaps.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Right, that&#8217;s what I thought you did.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Now, what are you seeing in the markets?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s pandemonium. It&#8217;s absolute crisis conditions in the markets.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well, what does that mean? Does it mean things aren&#8217;t trading?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;No. What it means is, the price of getting protection against the default of one major Wall Street bank against another major Wall Street bank is going through the roof. Credit default swaps are priced as a spread to the expected survivability of Treasury securities. And the spreads we&#8217;re now running in hundreds of basis points above.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich meant that the marketplace perceived that the likelihood of failure, of not just Lehman Brothers, but JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, was also very great. So we knew, the marketplace knew of the crisis. But the major regulator, the New York Federal Reserve, was calling around to platforms like us, asking, &#8220;What do you guys do, again? And what is the market telling us about what&#8217;s happening?&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI explained to him what&#8217;s happening and he said to me: &#8220;That is really interesting. I&#8217;d really like to understand that a lot better. Do you have time to come around the Federal Reserve and talk to us about this?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, gosh, it is such a crazy day.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But maybe by 8:00 or 9:00 tonight, I&#8217;ll get off the floor and come over and visit with you.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Oh, no, no, I&#8217;m way too busy.&#8221; He says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time. Look in your calendar. Maybe sometime in October, we can get together.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Boy, in October, I may have plenty of time to sit down with you and talk about this because it may all be over.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo realizations in that experience. One is, that there needed to be a regulatory intervention in this unregulated over-the-counter market. It just was not acceptable that in a crisis, regulators had to make phone calls around to understand what was going on in the market. But two, there needed to be a data and technology intervention in this market. It was perceived at the time, in September of 2008, the amount of credit default swaps protection written against Lehman Brothers was $400 billion, or thereabouts. But they didn&#8217;t know for sure. And if you multiply that across every Wall Street bank, you will get an idea of what would happen if any bank failed, with that much exposure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we now know, that if you took all of that exposure on Lehman Brothers, that $400 billion and netted it down, longs against shorts, collateralization, the total exposure would have been less than $9 billion, if Lehman Brothers failed. If we knew in 2008, that the failure of Lehman Brothers was a $9 billion exposure, the regulatory response could have been entirely different.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, that would have been a decision for the officials then. But certainly, $9 billion is a number the federal government could have guaranteed, and we could have a very different financial situation. The lack of visibility into counterparty credit exposure was at the root of the crisis. Why is that relevant? Because if all of that exposure had been on a blockchain, we would have known in real time, immediately, that it wasn&#8217;t $400 billion, that it was $9 billion. So, a tremendous amount of technology and market intelligence needs to come into the regulatory scheme. And it turns the conversation on its head. Just listening to Mark, interestingly, he was talking about why does the United States need to make sure innovation happens here? I take that even further and say, we, regulators, need fintech innovation to happen here and be available to us to change the dynamic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI became an advocate for the core reforms that made its way into Title VII of Dodd Frank, which are the reforms of the swaps market. And in 2013, I was honored by President Obama to serve on the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In 2017, President Trump named me as Chairman of the agency. And what I&#8217;ve observed over the last five years, is this phase of innovation that we&#8217;re in, this phase of fintech innovation is unlike ones that came before, because when the innovation came into the information space [in the late 20th century], it came into a regulatory light-touch environment because of our First Amendment, because information, and opinion, and speech is largely unregulated. But this level of innovation is entirely different. This round of innovation is coming smack dab into a brick wall of a heavily regulated space &#8212; financial services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs my colleague, Dan Gorfine says, &#8220;Whenever you&#8217;re talking about people&#8217;s money, you&#8217;re talking about regulation.&#8221; Every Congressman and Congresswoman and every Senator has a concern about the sanctity of the money and savings of their constituents. And this is a new phase of “innovation meets regulation” &#8212; and a very different one than before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me tell you a number of reasons why:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENumber one, the exponential rate of change, the exponential rate of innovation, the exponential rate of adoption, is totally alien to a political and regulatory system that was built and purposely designed to be impervious to change. Our founders didn&#8217;t trust political power and they built a system that is very difficult to change. Our system is intended to change very, very slowly.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESecondly, our system of regulation is one that is favorable to intermediation. If you think about the way regulators approach an ecosystem to regulate it, they look at the ecosystem and they say, &#8220;Okay, who are the intermediaries? Let&#8217;s register them. Let&#8217;s authorize them. Let&#8217;s confirm them. And let&#8217;s give them authority in the space.&#8221; Whether they be banks, exchanges, clearing houses. They&#8217;re all authorized, they have responsibilities. Regulators seek to intermediate spaces, whereas innovators seek to disintermediate and decentralize systems. So, this is another large conflict.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAnother difference is, these new fintech protocols are brand new, whereas regulatory protocols go back to the 1930s. The securities laws were written in the 1930s, our Commodity Exchange Act was written in the 1930s. So, you have a lot of inherent conflict between innovation and financial regulation.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what have we tried to do with the CFTC to change some of that dynamic? We try to do four things at the CFTC and we like to think that they&#8217;re perhaps a model for what other regulators in Washington and abroad can be doing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we&#8217;ve sought to adopt an exponential growth mindset. That is a mindset throughout our agency, expecting that the rate of innovation and the rate of market adoption of new technologies will be in line with Moore&#8217;s Law, that is grown exponentially faster all the time.

So what should a 21st century regulator look like? Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Christopher Giancarlo (more about him below) shared the following remarks on how the CFTC has been evolving and crafting a modern regulatory approach at the inaugural a16z Crypto Regulatory Summit &#8212; which brought together leading crypto experts and builders, other technologists, academics, industry executives, and government officials along with forward-thinking regulators to foster collaboration and the exchange of ideas. What are the &#8220;formula&#8221; or four key elements\u002F mindsets involved, how might they inform regulators, and what should entrepreneurs do as a result?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGood Morning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’d like to talk to you about the tension between the current FinTech revolution and our existing financial regulatory structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you know, the digitization of information that took place in the last decades of the 20th century occurred in a regulatory “light” zone of the US Constitution’s protection of speech.  Conversely, the current, early 21st century digitization of finance is taking place in a regulatory “heavy” zone of the long-established authority of U.S. state and federal governments to protect consumers of financial services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, the practices that guided the digitization of information (and that you are all familiar with, such as “don’t ask permission, ask forgiveness”) will not work, as we have seen with initial coin offerings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet, regulation and regulators need to adapt and not be an impenetrable barrier to the current wave of fintech innovation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, I want to explain the four-part model for regulatory adaptation to fintech innovation that we have successfully deployed at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut first, some personal background. I spent a decade and a half practicing law in New York and in London in the 80s and 90s.  And in 2001, I teamed up with a group of entrepreneurs, and we built the world&#8217;s first hybrid electronic trading platform for over-the-counter derivatives. We raised three rounds of private equity. We built trading platforms in 18 financial centers around the world. And in 2005, we took our company public and had one of the most successful IPOs and follow-on offerings of that period of time. And we were doing fintech before anybody had even an idea what fintech was, very successfully, I might add.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008, we had emerged into the world&#8217;s largest trading platform for a type of a derivative traded over the counter called, “credit default swaps”. You may have heard of them &#8211; played a role in the financial crisis. And I want to tell you a story about that, that tells you about a little bit of the junction of markets, regulation and technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn September of 2008, on a Wednesday afternoon, three days before Lehman Brothers failed, I got a call from a senior official of the New York Federal Reserve. And he said to me, &#8220;We&#8217;ve met before, right?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Remind me what you guys do again.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;We&#8217;re the world&#8217;s largest platform for trading credit default swaps.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Right, that&#8217;s what I thought you did.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Now, what are you seeing in the markets?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s pandemonium. It&#8217;s absolute crisis conditions in the markets.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well, what does that mean? Does it mean things aren&#8217;t trading?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;No. What it means is, the price of getting protection against the default of one major Wall Street bank against another major Wall Street bank is going through the roof. Credit default swaps are priced as a spread to the expected survivability of Treasury securities. And the spreads we&#8217;re now running in hundreds of basis points above.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich meant that the marketplace perceived that the likelihood of failure, of not just Lehman Brothers, but JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, was also very great. So we knew, the marketplace knew of the crisis. But the major regulator, the New York Federal Reserve, was calling around to platforms like us, asking, &#8220;What do you guys do, again? And what is the market telling us about what&#8217;s happening?&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI explained to him what&#8217;s happening and he said to me: &#8220;That is really interesting. I&#8217;d really like to understand that a lot better. Do you have time to come around the Federal Reserve and talk to us about this?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, gosh, it is such a crazy day.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But maybe by 8:00 or 9:00 tonight, I&#8217;ll get off the floor and come over and visit with you.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Oh, no, no, I&#8217;m way too busy.&#8221; He says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time. Look in your calendar. Maybe sometime in October, we can get together.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Boy, in October, I may have plenty of time to sit down with you and talk about this because it may all be over.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo realizations in that experience. One is, that there needed to be a regulatory intervention in this unregulated over-the-counter market. It just was not acceptable that in a crisis, regulators had to make phone calls around to understand what was going on in the market. But two, there needed to be a data and technology intervention in this market. It was perceived at the time, in September of 2008, the amount of credit default swaps protection written against Lehman Brothers was $400 billion, or thereabouts. But they didn&#8217;t know for sure. And if you multiply that across every Wall Street bank, you will get an idea of what would happen if any bank failed, with that much exposure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we now know, that if you took all of that exposure on Lehman Brothers, that $400 billion and netted it down, longs against shorts, collateralization, the total exposure would have been less than $9 billion, if Lehman Brothers failed. If we knew in 2008, that the failure of Lehman Brothers was a $9 billion exposure, the regulatory response could have been entirely different.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, that would have been a decision for the officials then. But certainly, $9 billion is a number the federal government could have guaranteed, and we could have a very different financial situation. The lack of visibility into counterparty credit exposure was at the root of the crisis. Why is that relevant? Because if all of that exposure had been on a blockchain, we would have known in real time, immediately, that it wasn&#8217;t $400 billion, that it was $9 billion. So, a tremendous amount of technology and market intelligence needs to come into the regulatory scheme. And it turns the conversation on its head. Just listening to Mark, interestingly, he was talking about why does the United States need to make sure innovation happens here? I take that even further and say, we, regulators, need fintech innovation to happen here and be available to us to change the dynamic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI became an advocate for the core reforms that made its way into Title VII of Dodd Frank, which are the reforms of the swaps market. And in 2013, I was honored by President Obama to serve on the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In 2017, President Trump named me as Chairman of the agency. And what I&#8217;ve observed over the last five years, is this phase of innovation that we&#8217;re in, this phase of fintech innovation is unlike ones that came before, because when the innovation came into the information space [in the late 20th century], it came into a regulatory light-touch environment because of our First Amendment, because information, and opinion, and speech is largely unregulated. But this level of innovation is entirely different. This round of innovation is coming smack dab into a brick wall of a heavily regulated space &#8212; financial services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs my colleague, Dan Gorfine says, &#8220;Whenever you&#8217;re talking about people&#8217;s money, you&#8217;re talking about regulation.&#8221; Every Congressman and Congresswoman and every Senator has a concern about the sanctity of the money and savings of their constituents. And this is a new phase of “innovation meets regulation” &#8212; and a very different one than before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me tell you a number of reasons why:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENumber one, the exponential rate of change, the exponential rate of innovation, the exponential rate of adoption, is totally alien to a political and regulatory system that was built and purposely designed to be impervious to change. Our founders didn&#8217;t trust political power and they built a system that is very difficult to change. Our system is intended to change very, very slowly.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESecondly, our system of regulation is one that is favorable to intermediation. If you think about the way regulators approach an ecosystem to regulate it, they look at the ecosystem and they say, &#8220;Okay, who are the intermediaries? Let&#8217;s register them. Let&#8217;s authorize them. Let&#8217;s confirm them. And let&#8217;s give them authority in the space.&#8221; Whether they be banks, exchanges, clearing houses. They&#8217;re all authorized, they have responsibilities. Regulators seek to intermediate spaces, whereas innovators seek to disintermediate and decentralize systems. So, this is another large conflict.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAnother difference is, these new fintech protocols are brand new, whereas regulatory protocols go back to the 1930s. The securities laws were written in the 1930s, our Commodity Exchange Act was written in the 1930s. So, you have a lot of inherent conflict between innovation and financial regulation.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what have we tried to do with the CFTC to change some of that dynamic? We try to do four things at the CFTC and we like to think that they&#8217;re perhaps a model for what other regulators in Washington and abroad can be doing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we&#8217;ve sought to adopt an exponential growth mindset. That is a mindset throughout our agency, expecting that the rate of innovation and the rate of market adoption of new technologies will be in line with Moore&#8217;s Law, that is grown exponentially faster all the time. And we&#8217;ve tried to adopt that same mindset in how we go about things. Now, part of that is in the CFTC’s DNA as an agency because we&#8217;re a principles-based, not a rules-based regulator. But we&#8217;ve tried to take that even further. So I&#8217;m very proud to say that several of my CFTC staff colleagues are with us today and one of my fellow Commissioners, Rostin Behnam.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re here. Why? Because if you&#8217;re going to have an exponential setup mindset, you&#8217;ve got to be learning. You&#8217;ve got to be with innovators.

As an agency, we try to flood the zone of learning, of understanding.  We can only regulate effectively, if we understand and anticipate the potential disruption to our regulatory framework.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, we&#8217;ve built an internal stakeholder at the CFTC to represent innovation within our agency, and it&#8217;s called Lab CFTC.

This meant that people or organizations could grow their internet presence knowing the rules of the game wouldn’t change later on. Huge web properties were started during this era including Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. In the process, the importance of centralized platforms like AOL greatly diminished.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the second era of the internet, from the mid 2000s to the present, for-profit tech companies — most notably Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) — built software and services that rapidly outpaced the capabilities of open protocols. The explosive growth of smartphones accelerated this trend as mobile apps became the majority of internet use. Eventually users migrated from open services to these more sophisticated, centralized services. Even when users still accessed open protocols like the web, they would typically do so mediated by GAFA software and services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that billions of people got access to amazing technologies, many of which were free to use. The bad news is that it became much harder for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presence without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them, taking away their audiences and profits. This in turn stifled innovation, making the internet less interesting and dynamic. Centralization has also created broader societal tensions, which we see in the debates over subjects like fake news, state sponsored bots, “no platforming” of users, EU privacy laws, and algorithmic biases. These debates will only intensify in the coming years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E“Web 3”: the third era of the internet\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne response to this centralization is to impose government regulation on large internet companies. This response assumes that the internet is similar to past communication networks like the phone, radio, and TV networks. But the hardware-based networks of the past are fundamentally different than the internet, a software-based network. Once hardware-based networks are built, they are nearly impossible to rearchitect. Software-based networks can be rearchitected through entrepreneurial innovation and market forces.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is the ultimate software-based network, consisting of a relatively simple \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FInternet_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecore layer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E connecting billions of fully programmable computers at the edge. Software is simply the encoding of human thought, and as such has an almost unbounded design space. Computers connected to the internet are, by and large, free to run whatever software their owners choose. Whatever can be dreamt up, with the right set of incentives, can quickly propagate across the internet. Internet architecture is where technical creativity and incentive design intersect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is still early in its evolution: the core internet services will likely be almost entirely rearchitected in the coming decades. This will be enabled by crypto-economic networks, a generalization of the ideas first introduced in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbitcoin.org\u002Fbitcoin.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBitcoin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and further developed in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fethereum\u002Fwiki\u002Fwiki\u002FWhite-Paper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEthereum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy decentralization?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization is a commonly misunderstood concept. For example, it is sometimes said that the reason cryptonetwork advocates favor decentralization is to resist government censorship, or because of libertarian political views. These are not the main reasons decentralization is important.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s look at the problems with centralized platforms. Centralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. When they start out, they do everything they can to recruit users and 3rd-party complements like developers, businesses, and media organizations. They do this to make their services more valuable, as platforms (by definition) are systems with multi-sided network effects. As platforms move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and 3rd parties steadily grows.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8389 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG.png 681w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG-300x129.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing lies in extracting data from users and competing with complements over audiences and profits. Historical examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, and Twitter vs. its 3rd-party clients. Operating systems like iOS and Android have behaved better, although still take a healthy 30% tax, reject apps for seemingly arbitrary reasons, and subsume the functionality of 3rd-party apps at will.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor 3rd parties, this transition from cooperation to competition feels like a bait-and-switch. Over time, the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors have become wary of building on top of centralized platforms. We now have decades of evidence that doing so will end in disappointment. In addition, users give up privacy, control of their data, and become vulnerable to security breaches. These problems with centralized platforms will likely become even more pronounced in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EEnter cryptonetworks\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptonetworks are networks built on top of the internet that 1) use consensus mechanisms such as blockchains to maintain and update state, 2) use cryptocurrencies (coins\u002Ftokens) to incentivize consensus participants (miners\u002Fvalidators) and other network participants. Some cryptonetworks, such as Ethereum, are general programming platforms that can be used for almost any purpose. Other cryptonetworks are special purpose, for example Bitcoin is intended primarily for storing value, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgolem.network\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGolem\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for performing computations, and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffilecoin.io\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFilecoin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for decentralized file storage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly internet protocols were technical specifications created by working groups or non-profit organizations that relied on the alignment of interests in the internet community to gain adoption. This method worked well during the very early stages of the internet but since the early 1990s very few new protocols have gained widespread adoption. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F18\u002F2017\u002F05\u002F27\u002Fcrypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECryptonetworks fix\u003C\u002Fa\u003E these problems by providing economics incentives to developers, maintainers, and other network participants in the form of tokens. They are also much more technically robust. For example, they are able to keep state and do arbitrary transformations on that state, something past protocols could never do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptonetworks use multiple mechanisms to ensure that they stay neutral as they grow, preventing the bait-and-switch of centralized platforms. First, the contract between cryptonetworks and their participants is enforced in open source code. Second, they are kept in check through mechanisms for \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FExit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E“voice” and “exit.”\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Participants are given voice through community governance, both “on chain” (via the protocol) and “off chain” (via the social structures around the protocol). Participants can exit either by leaving the network and selling their coins, or in the extreme case by forking the protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, cryptonetworks align network participants to work together toward a common goal — the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This alignment is one of the main reasons Bitcoin continues to defy skeptics and flourish, even while new cryptonetworks like Ethereum have grown alongside it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday’s cryptonetworks suffer from limitations that keep them from seriously challenging centralized incumbents. The most severe limitations are around performance and scalability. The next few years will be about fixing these limitations and building networks that form the infrastructure layer of the crypto stack. After that, most of the energy will turn to building applications on top of that infrastructure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow decentralization wins\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s one thing to say decentralized networks should win, and another thing to say they will win. Let’s look at specific reasons to be optimistic about this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware and web services are built by developers. There are millions of highly skilled developers in the world. Only a small fraction work at large technology companies, and only a small fraction of those work on new product development. Many of the most important software projects in history were created by startups or by communities of independent developers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.” — \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FJoy%27s_law_(management)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBill Joy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized networks can win the third era of the internet for the same reason they won the first era: by winning the hearts and minds of entrepreneurs and developers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn illustrative analogy is the rivalry in the 2000s between Wikipedia and its centralized competitors like Encarta. If you compared the two products in the early 2000s, Encarta was a far better product, with better topic coverage and higher accuracy. But Wikipedia improved at a much faster rate, because it had an active community of volunteer contributors who were attracted to its decentralized, community-governed ethos. By 2005, Wikipedia was the most \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@cdixon\u002Fit-s-hard-to-believe-today-but-10-years-ago-wikipedia-was-widely-considered-a-doomed-experiment-a7a0dfd27b8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epopular\u003C\u002Fa\u003E reference site on the internet. Encarta was shut down in 2009.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lesson is that when you compare centralized and decentralized systems you need to consider them dynamically, as processes, instead of statically, as rigid products. Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of cryptonetworks, there are multiple, compounding feedback loops involving developers of the core protocol, developers of complementary cryptonetworks, developers of 3rd party applications, and service providers who operate the network. These feedback loops are further amplified by the incentives of the associated token, which — as we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum — can supercharge the rate at which crypto communities develop (and sometimes lead to negative outcomes, as with the excessive electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question of whether decentralized or centralized systems will win the next era of the internet reduces to who will build the most compelling products, which in turn reduces to who will get more high quality developers and entrepreneurs on their side. GAFA has many advantages, including cash reserves, large user bases, and operational infrastructure. Cryptonetworks have a significantly more attractive value proposition to developers and entrepreneurs. If they can win their hearts and minds, they can mobilize far more resources than GAFA, and rapidly outpace their product development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“If you asked people in 1989 what they needed to make their life better, it was unlikely that they would have said a decentralized network of information nodes that are linked using hypertext.” — \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffarmerandfarmer.org\u002Fmastery\u002Fbuilder.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFarmer &amp; Farmer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECentralized platforms often come bundled at launch with compelling apps: Facebook had its core socializing features and the iPhone had a number of key apps. Decentralized platforms, by contrast, often launch half-baked and without clear use cases. As a result, they need to go through two phases of product-market fit: 1) product-market fit between the platform and the developers\u002Fentrepreneurs who will finish the platform and build out the ecosystem, and 2) product-market fit between the platform\u002Fecosystem and end users. This two-stage process is what causes many people — including sophisticated technologists — to consistently underestimate the potential of decentralized platforms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe next era of the internet\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized networks aren’t a silver bullet that will fix all the problems on the internet.

Since Twitter \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theverge.com\u002F2012\u002F8\u002F23\u002F3263481\u002Ftwitter-api-third-party-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eclosed\u003C\u002Fa\u003E their network to 3rd-party developers, the only company working on Twitter spam has been Twitter itself. By contrast, there were hundreds of companies that tried to fight email spam, financed by billions of dollars in venture capital and corporate funding. Email spam isn’t solved, but it’s a lot better now, because 3rd parties knew that the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FSimple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eemail protocol\u003C\u002Fa\u003E was decentralized, so they could build businesses on top of it without worrying about the rules of the game changing later on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr consider the problem of network governance. Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms. As we know from the offline world, democratic systems aren’t perfect, but they are a lot better than the alternatives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECentralized platforms have been dominant for so long that many people have forgotten there is a better way to build internet services. Cryptonetworks are a powerful way to develop community-owned networks and provide a level playing field for 3rd-party developers, creators, and businesses. We saw the value of decentralized systems in the first era of the internet. Hopefully we’ll get to see it again in the next.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

A few years later, business professors Ian Mitroff and R.

Senator Warren’s act \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wsj.com\u002Farticles\u002Fcompanies-shouldnt-be-accountable-only-to-shareholders-1534287687\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eproposes\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that shareholders have a “cause of action” to sue companies if they have not considered \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C\u002Fem\u003E stakeholders in their decisions. Meanwhile, Senators Schumer and Sanders have also raised this issue in the context of stock buybacks and dividends among U.S. corporations, since 93% of corporate profits in the last ten years have been disbursed that way, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2019\u002F02\u002F03\u002Fopinion\u002Fchuck-schumer-bernie-sanders.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Earguing\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that this excess cash could have instead been allocated to wages, hiring, and R&amp;D.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd even before this more recent wave of legislation, many states created a legal structure about a decade ago &#8212; the B Corporation &#8212; as a way to structurally enforce the concept of stakeholder primacy. “B-corps” enable companies to more explicitly consider the interests of constituents, even where such activities may not enhance shareholder value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of these proposals, while noble, are not really new.

Because the tension between “shareholder” and “stakeholder” primacy \u003Cem\u003Eis a false dichotomy\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. For good corporations, these two principles have never been in conflict. Good corporations have long recognized that maximizing long-term shareholder value requires an understanding of how customers, employees, and other constituents make decisions to engage (or not) with corporations, based on whether those corporations respect their priorities. In fact, deep and sustained engagement from stakeholders can translate into greater corporate profits, which drives \u003Cem\u003Elong-term\u003C\u002Fem\u003E shareholder value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[toc-embed]The virtuous loop: Customers &gt; Stakeholders &gt; Shareholders \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a corporation is managed well, balancing the goals of profit and purpose through good decision making, governance, and more, then “stakeholder primacy” reinforces “shareholder primacy”, and both are ultimately subservient to \u003Cem\u003Ecustomer primacy\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. But how is that possible, given seemingly competing motives among all these stakeholders?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause before anything or anyone else, corporations exist to serve the customers of their products or services. Without customers &#8212; without a market &#8212; a corporation cannot exist (at least, not without subsidies or other wells of cash). And customers &#8212; who have choice in a capitalist economy &#8212; can vote with their wallets. Don’t like something? Leave. This is why often brand boycotts and campaigns prove more effective in changing things than do laws.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, customers who care about social responsibility can not only leave, but can influence corporate behavior in the same way that customers who request or desire new features or service offerings do. And it’s the job of the board and the executive team to respond to this broad array of customer demands and prioritize them appropriately. Failing to do so will mean the end of the corporation and the destruction of shareholder value. In this way, responding appropriately (and proportionally) to customer needs drive long-term growth, profitability, and shareholder value. Everyone wins.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAirbnb’s \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cnbc.com\u002F2018\u002F09\u002F21\u002Fairbnb-wants-hosts-to-own-equity-is-asking-sec-for-a-rule-change.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Erecent request\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to the SEC for a rule change to provide stock options to home hosts is just one example of this alignment.

The only people who have a claim on the underlying value generated by a corporation are equity holders. In some cases, as in venture-backed startups, employees can also be equity holders through the grant of stock options… but that’s not the case for the vast majority of employees in traditional enterprises.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet we still don’t need legislation to compel better longer-term or broader ESG thinking from these corporations. The free market works well here.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETake for example cryptonetworks, which we’ve \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2018\u002F05\u002F04\u002Fconsiderations-for-regulating-cryptonetworks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Edefined as\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a new way to build “community owned and operated digital services”. As such, these new networks &#8212; and ways of coordinating human activity well beyond the scope of the traditional, limited structure of a firm &#8212; might have more answers for a more socially and economically conscious form of capitalism. (Or at least one that aligns participants in each cryptonetwork to the networks that match \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C\u002Fem\u003E values, instead of a one-size-fits-all model of “the firm”).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause cryptonetworks don’t rely on the good behavior of centralized corporations, but are governed by a decentralized network\u002Fcommunity of users, operators, maintainers, and others, the value created by them can accrue to any participant in different ways. The key mechanism for this is through “tokens” &#8212; which seek to align economic, capital, governance, mission, reputation, or any other incentives for the community &#8212; through proof of work, proof of stake, skin in the game, power users, karma points, and other game-theoretic and mathematical (and therefore more reliable) mechanisms for measuring work and value. In this sense, cryptonetworks could be the ultimate vehicle to democratize access for more people to capital, to wealth gains, and a say in governance &#8212; not just for corporations themselves but also for the ownership of their own identities and data too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe actual mechanisms are much \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Ftag\u002Fgovernance\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Emore nuanced\u003C\u002Fa\u003E than this, but the key point is that software now allows much more than what’s possible in traditional offline structures for coordinating activity. In fact, this networks model might be even \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C\u002Fem\u003E efficient than the classic coordination costs of the firm &#8212; the original argument made in Ronald Coase’s 1937 paper for why firms exist &#8212; because there is no one central entity determining and extracting value. Not only have many of the frictions and transaction costs been mediated by software, new forms of coordination and incentive mechanisms become possible as a result.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo make this more concrete, imagine a company like Airbnb, but built in the era of fully developed cryptonetworks. If it were established using blockchain architectures, this new organizational entity could issue a token that would be utilized as a reward system for the operators (or miners) who would ensure the veracity of transactions on the network and for the participants in the network (i.e., hosts, reviews, etc.). If the organization were to then become a successful business, the value of the token could increase commensurate with this value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut for company builders and developers, not just users and maintainers, there are other benefits. We believe such token economies could help solve the network-bootstrapping problem: Instead of having to subsidize hosts (and therefore have to take more, as in the high “take rate” of marketplace businesses) to help build the supply side in these new markets, the early users (both hosts and early adopters) could participate in the gains of the marketplace, thus aligning their participation with the growth of the company and its value. Similarly, guests could own their own reputation, reviews, and other associated data and activity on the network (as opposed to the network itself owning it). Or, power users like superhosts and frequent\u002F loyal guests could have more say in the future strategic direction of the entire organization by voting based on the level of their involvement(as opposed to who arbitrarily got there first, or only speculatively snapped up the tokens first). All of this would be structurally built in up front, through code (as opposed to corporate fiat).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this way, cryptonetworks could not only address many of the issues outlined above, but through decentralized autonomous organizations, could even reinvent the very nature of the firm… which is due to be revisited in an era of globalization, abundant bits, and widespread software.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E*    *    *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, the question isn’t who or what should have more say &#8212; shareholders or stakeholders, profit or purpose, wealth or capital &#8212; but rather, what’s the right time frame to judge tthat a corporation has satisfied its constituents? Short-termism &#8212; whether in the form of activist shareholders who demand cash-ectomies from corporations (through dividends and stock repurchases) or through fund managers who punish companies for trading off near-term earnings per share for long-term investments &#8212; is at the root of issue.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don’t need legislation to compel longer-term and broader ESG thinking from corporations; we need to give corporation the benefit of time and for consumers to exercise their voice through their wallets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECorporations and boards of directors already understand very clearly that they’re beholden to customers; without this, those companies can (and should) die.
