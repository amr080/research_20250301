Decentralization is actually at the heart of many issues dominating our conversations &#8212; whether it’s about who controls social media networks that influence our public discourse; who financial institutions choose to bank; who controls the AI tools that help us, but that can also generate bots and deepfakes; and other concerns.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does “decentralization” come in?

The same can be said of governments. This is why centralization and consolidation are the norm today: See Big Government, Big Banks, Big Tech, and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch like gravity, centralization is a force that’s hard to resist. By comparison, decentralization &#8212; transferring control and power to distributed groups &#8212; is inefficient. It&#8217;s like a rocketship: Decentralization requires immense energy, effort, and engineering to overcome the natural order.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo why fight this force of gravity?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause centralization has led us to countless services that leave users in the clutches of monopolies, capricious gatekeepers, unreliable platforms and extractive rent-seekers. But breaking up Big Everything through traditional regulations like anti-trust alone is just as fraught an approach.

It’s been hard to pull off in practice, however, because the technologies to coordinate at scale haven’t been possible (or available to all). Decentralization has therefore cost more, produced less, moved slower &#8212; not to mention also adding more complexity, redundancy, and messiness.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen going up against the well-established efficiency and stability of centralized systems, decentralized options didn’t stand a chance&#8230; Until now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, we have over a decade of proven technologies and techniques for decentralization to work at scale, through blockchains\u002F crypto &#8212; and we’ve already seen the results.

It’s also the force behind the United States itself; “federation” is just decentralization by another name. Yes, we have a centralized government, but each state also has power to make decisions democratically &#8212; unlike in dictatorships.

Decentralization means asking entrepreneurs and developers to give up control of their projects and proceed by consensus, rather than by singular command-and-control. Decentralization means builders, creators, and investors  distribute ownership to other network participants, thereby diluting their own economic interest. Decentralization means actively inviting third-parties to build out a given network, thereby reducing the founders’ own importance, standing, and singular vision. All of these forces push against decentralization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the easiest and cheapest path to building with blockchain technology is to take shortcuts &#8212; or skip decentralization altogether.

Against a hostile administration and unprecedented lawfare, the industry fought back boldly &#8212; and won.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut now, the industry faces a more pressing task: Helping to shape the legislation and policies that will govern it for decades to come. At the core of this fight is the issue of “decentralization.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, decentralization is the distribution of control and decision-making, eliminating the need for a central authority &#8212; ensuring more choice, transparency, security, and resilience for users. While it may sound technical, decentralization is the core premise of blockchain technologies. The \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fwhy-decentralization-matters-builders\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebenefits\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of decentralization include promoting competition, creativity, and collaboration while protecting freedom and value &#8212; both financial and reputational.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut why should decentralization be enshrined in law? By adopting policies that incentivize it, we can ensure three important outcomes:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we can guard against the big, centralized companies &#8212; from Big Tech, Big Finance, and Big Entertainment &#8212; entrenching their dominance in the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem. As we’ve seen across internet, banking, and entertainment networks, centralized control has led to consolidation and value extraction to the detriment of the people who use those products. The next iteration of the internet should focus on uplifting those in Little Tech, because the world needs more options, not the same few options.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, we can ensure founders and builders are rewarded for giving up unilateral control and for creating systems that function more like public infrastructure, and less like proprietary technologies. The internet rapidly evolved because entrepreneurs could build on top of shared, open protocols like email and the web. Blockchains unlock a similar, but even more expansive, world of possibilities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we can protect consumers and promote long-term investment and building. Minimum standards of decentralization would push digital assets to function more like commodities than securities, helping to guard against volatility, scams, and the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fblockchain-culture-computer-vs-casino\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecasino culture\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of pump-and-dump schemes &#8212; without stifling innovation.

Even though blockchains now make decentralization more technically possible and easier to implement at scale, it’s still far too convenient for builders to make unilateral decisions, rather than build consensus; and it’s tempting to hoard profits for a few, rather than distribute them among a community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how do we incentivize decentralization?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need a new “fit for purpose” regulatory framework for decentralized technologies like blockchains &#8212; one that isn’t predicated on the existence of centralized intermediaries, the way securities laws currently require. Such a framework could incentivize decentralization by reducing regulatory burdens; and by enabling broader market access for projects that both disseminate ownership \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C\u002Fem\u003E control as well as provide tailored disclosures.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis approach is not new &#8212; it builds on the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fabout\u002Fdivisions-offices\u002Fdivision-corporation-finance\u002Fframework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESEC’s 2019 Framework for Digital Assets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E &#8212; but it also solves one of the key paradoxes that framework had introduced. The framework sought to mitigate risks to users by limiting reliance on centralized actors. But, it also incentivized projects to obfuscate their ongoing development efforts &#8212; or to even abandon work altogether &#8212; exposing users to significant risks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy reframing decentralization in terms of control &#8212; and combining control-related decentralization requirements with disclosure requirements &#8212; this new regulatory framework would empower founders to build decentralized technologies, helping them resist the convenience and ease of centralization. And it would do so without exposing consumers to the risks securities laws aim to address.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis approach would also be malleable enough to evolve as the industry grows. It therefore fosters innovation, accelerates the progress of decentralized technologies, and enables the crypto ecosystem to thrive in the U.S. over the years to come.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere will obviously be pushback from those in the industry looking to advance their own agendas and gains &#8212; but let’s not lose sight of the benefits of blockchain technologies, not just for crypto users, but for all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we win the battle for decentralization, we can defend the purpose of

Crucially, in web3, this can be done without the permission of the original deployer of the protocol or the need to use a centrally controlled interface. For example, contrast, say, Twitter with a web3 protocol that provides an underlying data architecture designed for social media that is controlled by the public through token ownership rather than a corporation.

Upon meeting such a threshold the system may be “sufficiently decentralized” so that the application of U.S. securities laws to such system’s tokens should be unnecessary. As a threshold matter, this necessitates that a given token does not provide its holder with any contractual rights with respect to the ongoing efforts, assets, income, or resources of the issuer or any of its affiliates. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFactors of decentralization\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIn web3 systems that make use of native tokens, the three types of decentralization — technical, economic, legal — must be viewed holistically. Changes to one may affect the others. For example, decentralized economies help drive systems towards legal decentralization by prioritizing decentralized ownership among stakeholders, value accretion from decentralized sources, and value distribution to decentralized stakeholders. All of these decrease the risk of information asymmetries and the need to rely on managerial efforts of individuals.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EConversely, if the value of a digital asset of a web3 system is dependent on the ongoing managerial efforts of the original development team, then the decentralization of the system on all three levels may be jeopardized.

The answer may seem straightforward: crypto enthusiasts would answer with a resounding “yes,” while skeptics shake their heads. But the decision has less to do with faith than with practical market design considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fundamental question is how, precisely, decentralization through a blockchain can bring value to your business. In this article, I will guide you through an analysis of this question that’s rooted in economic theory and provide some insights to inform your decision. Like all models in economics, mine is built on several simplifying assumptions, which may not be applicable in all contexts. But the simplified model nevertheless helps uncover key sources of value for blockchains, and also helps characterize the context in which when decentralization may or may not be valuable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the center of this analysis is the “locked-in effect” – the idea that a user often finds it hard to leave a network after they have joined. Locked-in effects manifest for different reasons. Users may incur switching costs – the cost of the annoyance of setting up an account in another network. Alternatively, users may find leaving less attractive after they have spent time and effort training the algorithm of the network to adapt to their needs – think how Google learns from your past searches and personalizes search results to match your interests. Additionally, locked-in effects can be exacerbated by network effects that can give large networks significant advantages over competitors. Locked-in effects are inherent to many businesses, but their size varies case-by-case.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the business owner, locked-in effects come with a temptation to exploit locked-in users to increase profits. Suppose you own a company that has millions or potentially even billions of users and market research indicates that you can increase monetization – perhaps through advertising or charging higher platform fees – without losing customers. What would you do? A game theoretic analysis (and, quite frankly, common sense) predicts that you should increase monetization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe obvious danger, though, is that users may know that they can become locked-in and don’t want to be exploited. If you can’t credibly commit to not exploiting them (and you often can’t), then rational users, in my model, would demand “compensation” upfront. Such compensation might be monetary, but it can also take the form of no or very little advertisement during the growth phase of the network. Alternatively, users may refuse to join the network at all for the fear of being locked-in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key insight when considering using a blockchain, though, is that it allows you to generate \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F27\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\"\u003Ecredible commitment\u003C\u002Fa\u003Ethrough the design of the network. That is, you surrender control over monetization decisions to the users, enabling them to decide it through decentralized governance. This means that users can safely join the network because they aren&#8217;t worried about it being exploited later, even if they do get locked in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis leads to the main result of my analysis: \u003Cb\u003EIt makes sense to decentralize your business using a blockchain when the locked-in effect is sufficiently strong.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s go deeper into that conclusion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe model: game-theoretic analysis\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are the assumptions that underpin my model. Suppose that you are an entrepreneur who creates a network, deciding to either set it up using a centralized company, or to decentralize it through a blockchain. Further, the users interact with the network for many periods over a long period of time. Every day, potential users become aware of your network and can decide whether to join. Existing users can stay or leave. But existing users are locked-in, such that leaving the network in favor of another option has become less attractive. If you decide to implement the network through a regular company, you can change the intensity of monetization daily as you deem fit. If you decentralize the network through a blockchain, users will decide on the intensity of monetization through on-chain voting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this model, you as the entrepreneur are strictly interested in maximizing profits (this is another simplifying assumption), which are given by a function of the intensity with which the network is monetized, the number of users who are monetized, and the price at which such monetization can be sold – the number, for instance, of display ads on the network and the price an advertiser is willing to pay per ad and user.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers, in this model, are interested in three aspects of the network.

Two levels of monetization seem reasonable intuitively: first, a low level of monetization such that new users are willing to join, or a higher level of monetization that, while off-putting to new users, is not so high that it makes the the existing, locked-in users leave.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe monetization strategy that is more profitable depends crucially on the network’s growth prospects. When future growth is sufficiently strong, you are incentivized not to exploit the locked-in effect because you want to maintain network growth. But when growth slows down sufficiently, it makes more sense to forego network growth in favor of exploiting the locked-in effect of existing users by increasing monetization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in equilibrium, users – having been subject to the whims of Web2 platforms for so many years – have gotten smart and anticipate future exploitation. They therefore insist on being “compensated” beforehand (in my model, compensation might be monetary, but it can also take the form of little or no advertisement during the growth phase of the network, for example), which is costly to you. Thus, the control over monetization that you retain in centralized governance serves as both the advantage and the disadvantage of centralization. You can freely increase monetization to increase profits. However, you can&#8217;t commit to future monetization choices but will instead do what is optimal at each particular moment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EDecentralizing using a blockchain\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you choose to decentralize using a blockchain, the first question to answer is how to share governance, that is, how many of the tokens to keep for yourself and how many tokens to distribute to the users. If you want to credibly decentralize your business, you have to give away control, which means giving third-parties a majority of the tokens. Otherwise, you could easily win against the users in any vote.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tradeoffs are clear. If users have control over monetization, then you cannot exploit the users&#8217; locked-in effect, and they will not exploit their own locked-in effect either. As such, users do not need to be wary of future exploitation and need not be “compensated” beforehand. Thus, the network will be able to grow continuously rather than experience a growth phase followed by an exploitation phase.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet surrendering control and giving away governance tokens imposes serious costs. First, you cannot choose monetization of the network. Second, you have to share revenues with the users through the governance tokens.

Recall that the disadvantage in a centralized implementation was the lack of commitment to not exploit the locked-in effect in the future, leading to unhappy users who are nonetheless locked in. Without the locked-in effect, though, there is also no lack of commitment. This eliminates the disadvantage from centralization, and only the advantages remain. As a result, centralization will generally be preferred if there are no locked-in effects or if they are very small.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf locked-in effects are very large, it may not even be possible to attract users to the network. In particular, the threat of exploitation in the future may be too substantial to overcome, even if you did offer monetary compensation or to not monetize the network during the growth phase. In this case, decentralization is clearly preferable, as only then users can be attracted to the network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe optimal choice\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat, then, is the optimal choice of governance for the range of locked-in effects between the two extremes? A graph can help visualize the dynamic.

When there is no locked-in effect, the profit with centralized governance sits above the profit with decentralized governance. For locked-in effects that exceed some large enough threshold, we draw profit with centralized governance at 0.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the locked-in effect increases, the red line depicting the profits with decentralized governance does not change. But the profit with centralized governance – the blue line –  slopes downward as the locked-in effect grows. This may seem counterintuitive because a larger locked-in effect allows the entrepreneur to achieve higher profit in the exploitation phase. But in total, it is more expensive to induce users to join the network than the profits that can be generated from exploiting them in the future. The result, perhaps surprisingly, is that profit with centralized governance will eventually fall below the profit that can be achieved with decentralized governance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis logic brings us to the conclusion we started with: \u003Cstrong\u003Eit is optimal to choose decentralized governance if the size of the locked-in effect is sufficiently large\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. How large exactly “sufficiently large” is has to be determined on a case-by-case basis and depends on the specifics of the network, such as the strength of network effects, users&#8217; aversion to monetization, the potential profit from monetization, and user growth.

In practice, it is possible, and also quite common, to start with a centralized network and to decentralize it progressively over time. But decentralization must not be delayed for too long because the decision to decentralize is subject to a commitment problem, just as the monetization decisions are.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, suppose that you have promised your network’s users to implement decentralized governance at a later time. You keep delaying the decentralization of the network until you feel reasonably happy with the result. But by then, the network has grown very large and it is more profitable to exploit the users rather than to surrender control over the network by decentralizing it. If you delay decentralization for too long, users expect that you will not follow through with your plans.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat said, it may be beneficial to delay decentralizing the network for a while. In the model, it is profitable to delay decentralization until the commitment to not exploit your users has become sufficiently valuable. For practical purposes, it may also be advantageous to retain a larger degree of control over the network while it is being built – for example, to resolve problems, fix bugs, and otherwise improve the network (what some call “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fprogressive-decentralization-a-high-level-framework\u002F\"\u003Eprogressive decentralization\u003C\u002Fa\u003E”). But again, the network has to be decentralized before the temptation to retain control over the network to increase profits becomes too large. In practice, this would typically mean staying in charge of the network for a while and then airdropping the governance token and converting to decentralized governance. It may also be beneficial to distribute the tokens over time to gradually reinforce the desired commitment, rather than distributing them all at once. The timing of decentralization and token issuance is also often influenced by applicable regulatory considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this article, I have tried to convince you of one way (among possibly many) that decentralization can create value for your business: the value of the commitment to not exploit your users in the future.

The answer may seem straightforward: crypto enthusiasts would answer with a resounding “yes,” while skeptics shake their heads. But the decision has less to do with faith than with practical market design considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fundamental question is how, precisely, decentralization through a blockchain can bring value to your business. In this article, I will guide you through an analysis of this question that’s rooted in economic theory and provide some insights to inform your decision. Like all models in economics, mine is built on several simplifying assumptions, which may not be applicable in all contexts. But the simplified model nevertheless helps uncover key sources of value for blockchains, and also helps characterize the context in which when decentralization may or may not be valuable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the center of this analysis is the “locked-in effect” – the idea that a user often finds it hard to leave a network after they have joined. Locked-in effects manifest for different reasons. Users may incur switching costs – the cost of the annoyance of setting up an account in another network. Alternatively, users may find leaving less attractive after they have spent time and effort training the algorithm of the network to adapt to their needs – think how Google learns from your past searches and personalizes search results to match your interests. Additionally, locked-in effects can be exacerbated by network effects that can give large networks significant advantages over competitors. Locked-in effects are inherent to many businesses, but their size varies case-by-case.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the business owner, locked-in effects come with a temptation to exploit locked-in users to increase profits. Suppose you own a company that has millions or potentially even billions of users and market research indicates that you can increase monetization – perhaps through advertising or charging higher platform fees – without losing customers. What would you do? A game theoretic analysis (and, quite frankly, common sense) predicts that you should increase monetization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe obvious danger, though, is that users may know that they can become locked-in and don’t want to be exploited. If you can’t credibly commit to not exploiting them (and you often can’t), then rational users, in my model, would demand “compensation” upfront. Such compensation might be monetary, but it can also take the form of no or very little advertisement during the growth phase of the network. Alternatively, users may refuse to join the network at all for the fear of being locked-in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key insight when considering using a blockchain, though, is that it allows you to generate \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F27\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\"\u003Ecredible commitment\u003C\u002Fa\u003E through the design of the network.

Further, the users interact with the network for many periods over a long period of time. Every day, potential users become aware of your network and can decide whether to join. Existing users can stay or leave. But existing users are locked-in, such that leaving the network in favor of another option has become less attractive. If you decide to implement the network through a regular company, you can change the intensity of monetization daily as you deem fit.

When there is no locked-in effect, the profit with centralized governance sits above the profit with decentralized governance. For locked-in effects that exceed some large enough threshold, we draw profit with centralized governance at 0.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the locked-in effect increases, the red line depicting the profits with decentralized governance does not change. But the profit with centralized governance – the blue line –  slopes downward as the locked-in effect grows. This may seem counterintuitive because a larger locked-in effect allows the entrepreneur to achieve higher profit in the exploitation phase. But in total, it is more expensive to induce users to join the network than the profits that can be generated from exploiting them in the future. The result, perhaps surprisingly, is that profit with centralized governance will eventually fall below the profit that can be achieved with decentralized governance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis logic brings us to the conclusion we started with: \u003Cstrong\u003Eit is optimal to choose decentralized governance if the size of the locked-in effect is sufficiently large\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. How large exactly “sufficiently large” is has to be determined on a case-by-case basis and depends on the specifics of the network, such as the strength of network effects, users&#8217; aversion to monetization, the potential profit from monetization, and user growth.

In practice, it is possible, and also quite common, to start with a centralized network and to decentralize it progressively over time. But decentralization must not be delayed for too long because the decision to decentralize is subject to a commitment problem, just as the monetization decisions are.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, suppose that you have promised your network’s users to implement decentralized governance at a later time. You keep delaying the decentralization of the network until you feel reasonably happy with the result. But by then, the network has grown very large and it is more profitable to exploit the users rather than to surrender control over the network by decentralizing it. If you delay decentralization for too long, users expect that you will not follow through with your plans.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat said, it may be beneficial to delay decentralizing the network for a while. In the model, it is profitable to delay decentralization until the commitment to not exploit your users has become sufficiently valuable. For practical purposes, it may also be advantageous to retain a larger degree of control over the network while it is being built – for example, to resolve problems, fix bugs, and otherwise improve the network (what some call “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fprogressive-decentralization-a-high-level-framework\u002F\"\u003Eprogressive decentralization\u003C\u002Fa\u003E”). But again, the network has to be decentralized before the temptation to retain control over the network to increase profits becomes too large. In practice, this would typically mean staying in charge of the network for a while and then airdropping the governance token and converting to decentralized governance. It may also be beneficial to distribute the tokens over time to gradually reinforce the desired commitment, rather than distributing them all at once. The timing of decentralization and token issuance is also often influenced by applicable regulatory considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this article, I have tried to convince you of one way (among possibly many) that decentralization can create value for your business: the value of the commitment to not exploit your users in the future.

Many pressures push toward centralization in the short run even for companies that are committed to decentralization in the long run.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of the challenge, for instance, of initiating a product or conducting the type of quick iteration required to get to product-market fit without a core central team or a centralized process for decision-making. Furthermore, decentralization in web3 also typically comes with an expectation of composability, which introduces the risk that someone else might “fork” your product before you achieve scale.

For instance, a platform might be able to decentralize content curation even while there is still a relatively centralized tech stack. A given product can be segmented into “minimum decentralizable units” (MDUs) that are mostly independent from one another, and then decentralized along each of these dimensions separately. MDUs might include the core team, external contributors, the tech stack, and so on – we discuss various dimensions in more detail below.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then even within a given MDU, you don’t have to go from 0 to 100 all at once. A platform might gradually decentralize curation, say, by first soliciting content recommendations from the community, before eventually turning over content decisions entirely.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVisually, we think of this as like a set of slider bars – a “decentralization equalizer,” perhaps, with a different adjustment for each MDU. You can slide each bar up at its own pace, and the difficulty of sliding each bar is dependent on the business’s readiness for change on that dimension. In this sense, while architecting with decentralization in mind is more costly upfront, it can become a key source of competitive advantage because it makes the process of decentralization easier in the long run.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2023\u002F01\u002FSliders.jpeg\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Characterizing MDUs\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s important to stay aligned around a vision for how and what to decentralize, which requires some high-level coordination and usually some oversight over the “decentralization equalizer.” MDUs will vary across different business and product categories, but here are a few examples, along with illustrations of how you might set them up for decentralization success:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E1. Core team\u003C\u002Fb\u003E. Hire people who are able to set up their work so that it might be possible for external members to take over some of the responsibilities – for example, a community manager who designs the community in a way that allows members to start to self-manage and self-govern. Additionally, invest in upskilling your team with an eye toward decentralization as a long-term target, and of the new technologies and best practices that support those efforts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E2. External contributors\u003C\u002Fb\u003E. The further you slide toward fully decentralized, the more your community gets involved in how the product evolves and is governed. Calibrating based on how decentralized you want to be, you’ll want to build in a participatory way and cultivate the community that’s going to take part in building on top of shared infrastructure, contributing content, and\u002For governing the system. And it’s not just about inviting community participation – you have to design the organization in a way that enables people to contribute and rewards them for doing so. This means building robust feedback and engagement channels, together with the accompanying structures and processes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the reward side, meanwhile, introducing reward points or digital tokens to track and reward community contributions can help incentivize community activity (see \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Freputation-based-systems\u002F\"\u003Ethis article\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of ours for more on reputation system design). For example, you might start off by engaging external developers to test out your core infrastructure – perhaps by allocating rewards to developers who kick-start activity by building on top of the protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E3. The technology stack.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E The stack can be architected in a modular way that allows you to swap in decentralized versions of the centralized services that you start out with – for example, by starting out storing content on AWS and over time transitioning to decentralized storage services, such as Arweave or IPFS.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E4. Finance\u003C\u002Fb\u003E. You should plan for decentralization both in terms of how you fund the business initially and the ways you allocate resources internally and externally. In particular, you should structure finances in a resilient way that can sustain the organization without central control – for instance, consider how the investors you are bringing on would react to an \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.colorado.edu\u002Flab\u002Fmedlab\u002Fexit-to-community\"\u003Eexit to community control\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (which we might call a “decentralexit,” perhaps), and think through regular allocations to a community treasury.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E5. Internal processes\u003C\u002Fb\u003E. It’s important to invest the time upfront to think through what might be needed for you to decentralize parts of your operations and business processes – for example, you might need rich documentation that allows community members to understand precedent or context for specific decisions for governance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may be helpful to explicitly lay out your organization’s MDUs so as to provide a clear view of the various levers that you can share with the team and community. Not only would sharing the roadmap be in the spirit of decentralization, the community can also help you get there – and hold you to account. Once you have a set of MDUs, figure out where the slider currently sits on each of the dimensions and start to form a view of where you’d like it to go over time. There is also an order of operations here that will make sense, and teams should probably start with the MDUs that have less of a negative impact if things go wrong.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Which slider to move, and when?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally: how do you know when it’s time to move the slider up – that is, when can you increase decentralization of one or more dimensions?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EZooming out, it’s first important that your overall system is relatively stable. What exactly does this mean? In an earlier \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F09\u002Fprogressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management\u002F\"\u003Earticle\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for a16z, Jesse Walden encouraged teams to assess where they sit on the journey to and past \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lennysnewsletter.com\u002Fp\u002Fhow-to-know-if-youve-got-productmarket\"\u003Eproduct-market fit\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: How many more iterations do you still need to go through, and how quickly? This is important because any form of organizational change will slow down the operation; you want to time moving a slider so that the long-run benefit of slowing down outweighs the short-run cost. Ideally, you would also make the move at a time when the social and economic dynamics of your platform have stabilized enough that you can robustly predict how adjusting the level of decentralization will affect community behavior and outcomes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, you should assess each MDU in turn. Each dimension will have its own set of factors to weigh when deciding whether to adjust the slider. You might get pushed to decentralize on a specific dimension – for example, you might have too much user-generated content to manage on your own, making it critical to start involving the wider community in curation. Alternatively, you might choose to increase decentralization entirely of your own volition – one instance could be that you see long-term business value in storing content in a decentralized way, and so you make the active choice to start using such a service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd once again, it isn’t all or nothing. Decentralization happens at a different pace along each MDU. For example, you might start to plan your finances in a way that keeps the option of “exit-to-community” open from day 1; establish a community treasury six months in; and then later switch to fully decentralized financial governance. And in parallel with that, you might maintain a centralized tech stack while iterating toward a stable product before looking for more peer-to-peer options.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization is powerful, but it isn&#8217;t easy. Especially early on, the need for fast iteration, quality control, and security often drive toward centralized development (although this might change as the technology for decentralized development improves).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you aim for your business to be decentralized in the long run, the key is to plan for that upfront, and not lose track of it as you build. We might see the role of a CEO or COO evolve to take care of the &#8220;decentralization equalizer&#8221; – or even the introduction of an entirely new position, like a &#8220;Chief Decentralization Officer.&#8221; Thinking in terms of MDUs can help you figure out where and how to decentralize different aspects of your business. And then as the product evolves, you can decentralize along each MDU progressively, when the time is right.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fhbr.org\u002Fsearch?term=jad%20esber&amp;search_type=search-all\"\u003EJad Esber\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is the co-founder and CEO of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fkoodoslabs.xyz\u002F\"\u003Ekoodos labs\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (DBA \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fkoodos.com\u002F\"\u003Ekoodos\u003C\u002Fa\u003E) and an Affiliate at Harvard’s \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcyber.harvard.edu\u002Fpeople\u002Fjad-esber\"\u003EBerkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and The New School’s \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fplatform.coop\u002Fpeople\u002Fjad-esber-2\u002F\"\u003EInstitute for the Cooperative Digital Economy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

Understanding the differences in these elements is key to designing web3 systems because design decisions with respect to one affects the others.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ETechnical decentralization\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnical decentralization relates primarily to the \u003Cstrong\u003Esecurity\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Estructural mechanisms\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. The core innovation behind programmable blockchains is that they can support technical decentralization by providing a permissionless, trustless, and verifiable ecosystem in which value can be transferred &#8212; and, more importantly, upon which web3 products and services can be \u003Cem\u003Ebuilt\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis means that products and services can be deployed and run without requiring trusted, centralized intermediaries to operate (or pull the rug out from under) them, opening a vast world of possibilities. For these reasons, technical decentralization acts as the \u003Cem\u003Efoundation\u003C\u002Fem\u003E upon which the other two types of decentralization can occur: economic and legal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EEconomic decentralization\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEconomic decentralization relates to the \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomies\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. The advent of programmable blockchains (such as Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche) and digital assets (such as ETH, SOL, and AVAX) unlocked the ability of open source and decentralized systems to finally have their own \u003Cstrong\u003Edecentralized\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomies\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (i.e., autonomous free-market economies).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a critical breakthrough. The open source and decentralized protocols of previous generations of technology like web1 (such as http, smtp, ftp, etc.) stagnated because they lacked the ability to incentivize ongoing development and\u002F or further investment of critical resources back into their systems. This left fertile ground for the centralized companies of web2 to emerge and succeed as they were able to leverage their efficiency and resources to build products and services that surpassed those of web1. But this centralization also led to countless examples of user rights abuses, de-platforming, and aggressive take-rates.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, the technology underpinning web3 makes it possible for far more sophisticated open source and decentralized systems to be created &#8212; and enables decentralized economies to form around them &#8212; which will enable the products and services of web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of web2.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilders of web3 systems can facilitate the formation of decentralized economies through careful design decisions that lead to their systems accruing “value” &#8212; whether information, economic value, voting power, or other form &#8212; from a broad array of sources, and distributing that value equitably among system stakeholders according to their contributions. In order to achieve this, web3 systems need to vest meaningful power, control, and ownership to system stakeholders (via airdrops, other token distributions, decentralized governance, etc.). This in turn encourages stakeholders to contribute meaningful value, because they have agency over how their contributions are treated and rewarded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ongoing balancing of incentives among the stakeholders &#8212; developers, contributors, and consumers &#8212; can then drive further contributions of value to the overall system, to the benefit of all. In other words: all the benefits of modern network effects, but without the pitfalls of centralized control and captive economies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ELegal decentralization\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELegal decentralization relates to the \u003Cstrong\u003Elegality\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. In this piece, I focus primarily on U.S. securities laws, which dictate how and whether web3 systems may make use of their own native digital assets. While there is no codified standard of “legal decentralization,” a first-principles analysis of U.S. securities laws, case law, and SEC guidance (including the SEC’s \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fcorpfin\u002F%20framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets#_edn1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edefinitive guidance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E from April 2019) can help us formulate a practical standard.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, U.S. securities laws are generally intended to create a “level playing field” for securities transactions by limiting the ability of those with more information from taking advantage of others with less information. This is the principle of \u003Cstrong\u003Einformation asymmetry\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and U.S. securities laws typically seek to eliminate asymmetry in certain securities transactions by applying disclosure requirements. The principle plays a role in the \u003Cem\u003EHowey \u003C\u002Fem\u003Etest, the subjective test that determines whether U.S. securities laws should apply to a digital assets transaction where there is (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profit (4) primarily based upon the managerial efforts of others. The fourth prong seeks to address information asymmetry on the basis of the belief that where there is a reliance on “managerial efforts”, the risk of information asymmetry (of the managers versus outsiders) is likely high, and therefore the application of securities laws may be necessary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the above and SEC guidance, we can surmise that if a web3 system can (a) eliminate the potential for significant information asymmetries to arise and (b) eliminate reliance on essential managerial efforts of others to drive the success or failure of that enterprise, then the system \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C\u002Fem\u003E be “sufficiently decentralized” such that the application of U.S. securities laws to its digital assets shouldn’t be necessary. For purposes of this piece, I refer to these systems as being \u003Cstrong\u003Elegally decentralized\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Admittedly, the legal decentralization threshold will not be capable of being met by most businesses, but as I outline below, the novel components of web3 systems uniquely position them to meet such a threshold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECollectively, these three separate aspects of decentralization &#8212; technical, economic, legal &#8212; must be viewed holistically, as a single design challenge, because design decisions with respect to one will affect another. In general, the interplay between \u003Cstrong\u003Etechnical\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomic\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Elegal\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is primarily \u003Cem\u003Eadditive\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, not subtractive &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Edevelopments in one create more possibilities in the others\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. For example: Decentralized economies help drive systems towards legal decentralization by prioritizing decentralized ownership among stakeholders, value accretion from decentralized sources, and value distribution to decentralized stakeholders. All of these decrease the risk of information asymmetries and the need to rely on managerial efforts of individuals.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor more background on legal and economic decentralization and how these aspects fit together, see the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F04\u002Fprinciples-and-models-of-decentralization_miles-jennings_a16zcrypto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efull paper\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed headline=&#8221;(2) components for decentralization&#8221;]\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(2) How the components of web3 systems can be used to achieve decentralization \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen web3 systems are designed well, decentralization becomes a virtuous, not vicious circle.

Within DeFi, where most clients are just simple frontend websites that provide a gateway to the underlying smart contract protocol (that is, they allow users to interact with the protocol), most developer companies make their client\u002F website open source, and host it on a decentralized file system (such as IPFS). With the client\u002F website open source, third parties that are independent from the developer company often end up hosting their own clients\u002F websites providing access to the same underlying protocol. In addition, independent third parties often build gateways to the protocol into their own aggregators and dashboards. This means that gateways to the protocol are always available, regardless of whether the developer company’s client\u002F website is maintained.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe above steps mostly eliminate the potential for information asymmetries &#8212; the impetus for much of the U.S. securities laws &#8212; because (1) information about the protocol and its operations are transparently available on a public blockchain ledger, and (2) the managerial efforts of the developer company that launched the protocol are no longer critical to the success or failure of such protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd since the blockchain and smart contract layers are operational and not controlled by any group or entity, the system has full redundancy and is no longer reliant on the developer company. DeFi primitives are a great example of this because they require little to no ongoing development to continue providing users with utility. As a result, protocols implementing this decentralization model could be considered legally decentralized, even without a fully functioning decentralized economy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003ELimitations of full decentralization\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the full decentralization model has been successfully used in DeFi, its simplicity could make it unsuitable for more complex web3 systems.

The decentralization of clients within DeFi is somewhat straightforward given their relative simplicity &#8212; very little incentivization is necessary to get third parties to build independent and simple gateways (mostly in the form of websites) to such protocols. However, as web3 products and services become increasingly complex, with computationally expensive\u002F resource-intensive client layers built on top of underlying smart contract protocols, the decentralization of the client becomes more complicated. For example, consider the difference in complexity of the clients\u002F websites that provide access to the \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Funiswap.org\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EUniswap\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"blank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECompound\u003C\u002Fa\u003E protocols, as compared to hypothetical web3 social media clients, which would need the full-featured functionality of web2 applications like Twitter and Instagram.

Developer companies may intend to undertake significant operations to enhance the value of their web3 system post-launch of their digital asset.

If such imbalances could easily occur, then the builders of these clients could view the web3 system unfavorably and be less willing to invest their time and resources in it.

Understanding the differences in these elements is key to designing web3 systems because design decisions with respect to one affects the others.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]Technical decentralization\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnical decentralization relates primarily to the \u003Cstrong\u003Esecurity\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Estructural mechanisms\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. The core innovation behind programmable blockchains is that they can support technical decentralization by providing a permissionless, trustless, and verifiable ecosystem in which value can be transferred &#8212; and, more importantly, upon which web3 products and services can be \u003Cem\u003Ebuilt\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis means that products and services can be deployed and run without requiring trusted, centralized intermediaries to operate (or pull the rug out from under) them, opening a vast world of possibilities. For these reasons, technical decentralization acts as the \u003Cem\u003Efoundation\u003C\u002Fem\u003E upon which the other two types of decentralization can occur: economic and legal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]Economic decentralization\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEconomic decentralization relates to the \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomies\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. The advent of programmable blockchains (such as Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche) and digital assets (such as ETH, SOL, and AVAX) unlocked the ability of open source and decentralized systems to finally have their own \u003Cstrong\u003Edecentralized\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomies\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (i.e., autonomous free-market economies).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a critical breakthrough. The open source and decentralized protocols of previous generations of technology like web1 (such as http, smtp, ftp, etc.) stagnated because they lacked the ability to incentivize ongoing development and\u002F or further investment of critical resources back into their systems. This left fertile ground for the centralized companies of web2 to emerge and succeed as they were able to leverage their efficiency and resources to build products and services that surpassed those of web1. But this centralization also led to countless examples of user rights abuses, de-platforming, and aggressive take-rates.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, the technology underpinning web3 makes it possible for far more sophisticated open source and decentralized systems to be created &#8212; and enables decentralized economies to form around them &#8212; which will enable the products and services of web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of web2.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilders of web3 systems can facilitate the formation of decentralized economies through careful design decisions that lead to their systems accruing “value” &#8212; whether information, economic value, voting power, or other form &#8212; from a broad array of sources, and distributing that value equitably among system stakeholders according to their contributions. In order to achieve this, web3 systems need to vest meaningful power, control, and ownership to system stakeholders (via airdrops, other token distributions, decentralized governance, etc.). This in turn encourages stakeholders to contribute meaningful value, because they have agency over how their contributions are treated and rewarded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ongoing balancing of incentives among the stakeholders &#8212; developers, contributors, and consumers &#8212; can then drive further contributions of value to the overall system, to the benefit of all. In other words: all the benefits of modern network effects, but without the pitfalls of centralized control and captive economies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Legal decentralization\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELegal decentralization relates to the \u003Cstrong\u003Elegality\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of web3 systems. In this piece, I focus primarily on U.S. securities laws, which dictate how and whether web3 systems may make use of their own native digital assets. While there is no codified standard of “legal decentralization,” a first-principles analysis of U.S. securities laws, case law, and SEC guidance (including the SEC’s definitive guidance from April 2019) can help us formulate a practical standard.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, U.S. securities laws are generally intended to create a “level playing field” for securities transactions by limiting the ability of those with more information from taking advantage of others with less information. This is the principle of \u003Cstrong\u003Einformation asymmetry\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and U.S. securities laws typically seek to eliminate asymmetry in certain securities transactions by applying disclosure requirements. The principle plays a role in the \u003Cem\u003EHowey \u003C\u002Fem\u003Etest, the subjective test that determines whether U.S. securities laws should apply to a digital assets transaction where there is (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profit (4) primarily based upon the managerial efforts of others. The fourth prong seeks to address information asymmetry on the basis of the belief that where there is a reliance on “managerial efforts”, the risk of information asymmetry (of the managers versus outsiders) is likely high, and therefore the application of securities laws may be necessary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the above and SEC guidance, we can surmise that if a web3 system can (a) eliminate the potential for significant information asymmetries to arise and (b) eliminate reliance on essential managerial efforts of others to drive the success or failure of that enterprise, then the system \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C\u002Fem\u003E be “sufficiently decentralized” such that the application of U.S. securities laws to its digital assets shouldn’t be necessary. For purposes of this piece, I refer to these systems as being \u003Cstrong\u003Elegally decentralized\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Admittedly, the legal decentralization threshold will not be capable of being met by most businesses, but as I outline below, the novel components of web3 systems uniquely position them to meet such a threshold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECollectively, these three separate aspects of decentralization &#8212; technical, economic, legal &#8212; must be viewed holistically, as a single design challenge, because design decisions with respect to one will affect another. In general, the interplay between \u003Cstrong\u003Etechnical\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Eeconomic\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Elegal\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is primarily \u003Cem\u003Eadditive\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, not subtractive &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Edevelopments in one create more possibilities in the others\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. For example: Decentralized economies help drive systems towards legal decentralization by prioritizing decentralized ownership among stakeholders, value accretion from decentralized sources, and value distribution to decentralized stakeholders. All of these decrease the risk of information asymmetries and the need to rely on managerial efforts of individuals.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor more background on legal and economic decentralization and how these aspects fit together, see the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F04\u002Fprinciples-and-models-of-decentralization_miles-jennings_a16zcrypto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efull paper\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed](2) How the components of web3 systems can be used to achieve decentralization\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen web3 systems are designed well, decentralization becomes a virtuous, not vicious circle.

Within DeFi, where most clients are just simple frontend websites that provide a gateway to the underlying smart contract protocol (that is, they allow users to interact with the protocol), most developer companies make their client\u002F website open source, and host it on a decentralized file system (such as IPFS). With the client\u002F website open source, third parties that are independent from the developer company often end up hosting their own clients\u002F websites providing access to the same underlying protocol. In addition, independent third parties often build gateways to the protocol into their own aggregators and dashboards.

The decentralization of clients within DeFi is somewhat straightforward given their relative simplicity &#8212; very little incentivization is necessary to get third parties to build independent and simple gateways (mostly in the form of websites) to such protocols. However, as web3 products and services become increasingly complex, with computationally expensive\u002F resource-intensive client layers built on top of underlying smart contract protocols, the decentralization of the client becomes more complicated.

In more complex web3 systems, we would expect to see the prevalence of such awards increase significantly. For example, in a decentralized social media ecosystem, a client’s user engagement could be measured and rewarded via tokens. Finally, in addition to incentives from the protocol, the operators of clients would be incentivized by any financial returns they are able to generate through their own proprietary clients.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilders seeking to decentralize their web3 systems via the open decentralization model will need to design their incentive mechanisms and their decentralized governance models to be “client agnostic” to encourage participation by many actors.

If such imbalances could easily occur, then the builders of these clients could view the web3 system unfavorably and be less willing to invest their time and resources in it. In some ways, such a system would have similar centralization and control problems as web2 systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilders using the open decentralization model should also prioritize transparency, open-source technology, data portability, and composability to further reduce the risk of power over their systems becoming concentrated in the hands of developers.

But as NFT projects have grown in complexity, the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E analysis has become less straightforward. NFT projects now often involve additional content creation\u002F additional NFT drops, implementation of NFTs in video games, community-driven product development, and other activities &#8212; all of which potentially increase the reliance of NFT holders on the managerial efforts of others\u003Cem\u003E. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENFT projects should therefore consider incorporating the principles of decentralization into their web3 systems, particularly if they intend to couple the project with a fungible token. What would that model of NFT project decentralization look like? The image below is one example. It reflects: (1) an NFT collection minted on a blockchain and held by various users; (2) intellectual property contributed to the NFT community, most likely relating to the NFTs themselves (which could be “staked” to the community by the holders) and any lore created by the community; (3) digital assets distributions and incentivization mechanisms; (4) the launching of DAO governance with respect to the community intellectual property and DAO treasury; (5) the initiation of derivative projects; and (6) the hosting of social gatherings and events.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5191 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F04\u002Fweb3opendecentralizationmodelfornfts_milesjennings_a16zcrypto-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"web3 open decentralization model for NFTs\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1445\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this model, economic decentralization for NFT projects can be achieved through several steps:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFirst, the DAO could use its initial resources on community engagement (e.g., Twitter,Discord, etc.) and to fund social gatherings and other events &#8212; thereby boosting the \u003Cstrong\u003Eimplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E of the community (i.e., its popularity).\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESecond, those \u003Cstrong\u003Eimplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8212; along with \u003Cstrong\u003Eexplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (such as fungible token awards, access to NFT sales, etc.) &#8212; could then be used to incentivize the creation of \u003Cstrong\u003Ederivative projects\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E utilizing the community’s intellectual property. Developers would receive rewards for developing such projects, and consumers would receive awards for using them. For example, the DAO could employ a third-party developer to create a play-to-earn game using the community’s characters, with in-game tokenomics featuring the native digital asset of the community. In this regard, derivative projects act similarly to the clients described in the earlier open decentralization models, making the overall system less dependent on any single source to drive value to NFT holders, which helps limit the risk of significant information asymmetries arising.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFinally, another significant tool that NFT projects have at their disposal are \u003Cem\u003Eroyalties on secondary sales\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of NFTs accruing to the DAO, which can fuel their decentralized economies. These royalties would provide the DAO with a decentralized revenue stream during periods in which derivative projects may not be producing sufficient returns for the system.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the combination of value accruing to the ecosystem from derivative projects and secondary sales could drive the creation of a healthy decentralized economy for the NFT project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom a legal decentralization perspective, the key questions would again be: Are the essential managerial efforts of any third party necessary to drive the success or failure of the web3 system? And is there potential for significant information asymmetries to arise? The answer to both questions would depend on many of the same considerations discussed above.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, in this case, the intellectual property in the NFT scenario likely \u003Cem\u003Econtributes\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, rather than hinders, to the community’s overall decentralization. Why? Because the intellectual property is contributed to the DAO from a decentralized source (the NFT holders). Furthermore, if the DAO were to control distributions of tokens, additional minting of NFTs, and decentralized intellectual property &#8212; along with decentralized revenue streams (either from royalties or derivative projects) &#8212; the system would be unlikely to develop significant information asymmetries.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost NFT projects are still in nascent stages, so we have yet to see many examples of NFT projects deploying decentralized tokenomics, but we expect to see a variety of mechanisms.

But analysis of recent SEC commentary and enforcement actions suggests that true decentralization may enable a startup&#8217;s token to transmute from a security to a non-security if the team is able to sufficiently decentralize operations, eliminating information asymmetry or dependency on the efforts of the founding team to create value. One key test for whether an investment might be deemed a security is whether investors are relying on the efforts of others with the expectation of profits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Scott Kupor, managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F22\u002Fmutability-sec-recent-cases\u002F\"\u003Ehas previously written\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: “In the pre-network stage, tokens will generally be characterized as securities in light of the ‘reliance on the efforts of others’ prong of the Howey Test.

During this phase, the only thing that matters is product\u002Fmarket fit. To move fast toward finding it, it&#8217;s important to avoid design by committee (or community!) A product needs opinionated leadership to test hypotheses and update assumptions quickly. In practice, this could mean admin privileges on smart contracts, which allow for rapid iteration and product management — including upgrades, shutdown, or quick parameter setting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage, there should be no pretense of decentralization — a core team is driving all product decisions by necessity, in the interest of finding product\u002Fmarket fit. Launching a token at this stage is not advisable because it could trip compliance wires. Dependence on the core team&#8217;s efforts is one way a token might be deemed a security under the Howey Test, and thinking about this is a distraction from product development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of a core team controlling all aspects of a project may ruffle the feathers of some early users, but founders shouldn’t be wary of this. If users are complaining about the control you&#8217;ve got, that&#8217;s actually a good problem to have! It means someone cares about what you&#8217;ve built. That said, it&#8217;s important to communicate clearly about where control exists. Faking autonomy is a quick way to undermine trust, whereas transparency is a way to build it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Objective 2: Community Participation\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt early signs of product traction — a growing user base, developer ecosystem and network effects — it&#8217;s time to start devoting more cycles to fostering harmony between passive users, more-active contributors and the core team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, founders might invest more heavily in best practices for running the product like an open source project: invest in good documentation; develop openly; offer bounties, grants or other incentives for third-party development; hire community leaders to help steward open development; and introduce\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftools.ietf.org\u002Fhtml\u002Frfc7282\"\u003E rough consensus\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on decision making.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing further, it may make sense to start eliminating platform risk through imposed technical constraints.

In order to provide the same pricing in a fee-free fork, you&#8217;d need to coordinate all the liquidity providers and third-party services integrated with the original to start using said fork.

A number of teams have elected to do this by allocating a slice of future tokens to early “power” contributors, for example through testnet programs where independent community members can register to participate in operating a node. A promissory and managed token distribution to users that contribute valuable work can help eliminate community dependency on the effort of founding teams.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, teams need to plan how remaining tokens will be distributed to participants, both fairly for past contributions, and effectively as a future incentive for ongoing participation\u003Cb\u003E.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E The distribution design needs to consider the core team that built the product, as well as the users that make it useful.

Without a working product, ownership is worthless, and the community won&#8217;t stick. Many teams that have done this are unable to back into product\u002Fmarket fit, and as a result have a hard time kickstarting meaningful community participation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother sequencing risk is jumping straight from early signs of product\u002Fmarket fit to decentralized community ownership (skipping objective 2, community participation.) Failing to formalize \u003Ci\u003Ereal\u003C\u002Fi\u003E community participation can land projects in an uncanny valley of decentralization theater. A symptom of being caught here is an apathetic community with low participation rates, and a heavy dependency on founding teams. In this situation, formalizing control (e.g. through delegation) may be a better path to building trust, whereas hiding under the pretense of decentralization is a quick way to undermine it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to get stuck is to aim to do all three things at once. Lack of focus is the death of most startups, and the same is true for crypto applications. Each of these objectives overlap and needs to be considered holistically, as part of an idea maze, but execution needs to be sequenced and prioritized, not attempted at once.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, it’s worth noting that even if you do the steps in order, once you flip the switch to full community ownership, you&#8217;re in fairly uncharted territory in terms of governing the application. Scaling effective community decision-making is challenging, but if internet communities can accomplish feats like Wikipedia, I&#8217;m optimistic that experimentation and skin-in-the-game (via valuable ownership) can lead to cooperative decision-making at unprecedented scale.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo far, we have yet to see a crypto application execute each of the objectives sequentially, but the most promising project teams I’ve spoken with have been navigating their way through this playbook.

In contrast, user-owned networks can benefit from a\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fjessewalden.com\u002Fpast-present-future-from-co-ops-to-cryptonetworks\u002F\"\u003E cooperative economic model\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that helps ensure crypto services remain better aligned with their users, even as they scale.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother important reason for achieving decentralized community control is regulatory compliance\u003Cb\u003E.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E Crypto tokens that facilitate economic alignment can be deemed securities under the\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2018\u002F05\u002F04\u002Fconsiderations-for-regulating-cryptonetworks\u002F\"\u003E Howey Test\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a regulatory framework used by the SEC. Managing a distribution of securities to a large community of users can be challenging and expensive for a startup to manage — even Airbnb and Uber \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pillsburylaw.com\u002Fen\u002Fnews-and-insights\u002Frule-701-revision-uber-airbnb.html\"\u003Ehaven’t figured out how to do it\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. But analysis of recent SEC commentary and enforcement actions suggests that true decentralization may enable a startup&#8217;s token to transmute from a security to a non-security if the team is able to sufficiently decentralize operations, eliminating information asymmetry or dependency on the efforts of the founding team to create value. One key test for whether an investment might be deemed a security is whether investors are relying on the efforts of others with the expectation of profits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Scott Kupor, managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F22\u002Fmutability-sec-recent-cases\u002F\"\u003Ehas previously written\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: “In the pre-network stage, tokens will generally be characterized as securities in light of the ‘reliance on the efforts of others’ prong of the Howey Test. However, post-network launch — provided that the network is sufficiently decentralized — the nature of the token can change from security to non-security, owing to the fact that the holder of the token is no longer relying on the efforts of others.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, with these reasons for decentralization in mind, let’s walk through a framework for tackling it as a process, with the goal of building a sustainable, compliant and community-owned product.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Objective 1: Product\u002FMarket Fit\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe earliest stage of building a crypto application requires all the ingredients of a normal startup: a great team, lean development, tight execution, and quick learning. During this phase, the only thing that matters is product\u002Fmarket fit. To move fast toward finding it, it&#8217;s important to avoid design by committee (or community!) A product needs opinionated leadership to test hypotheses and update assumptions quickly. In practice, this could mean admin privileges on smart contracts, which allow for rapid iteration and product management — including upgrades, shutdown, or quick parameter setting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage, there should be no pretense of decentralization — a core team is driving all product decisions by necessity, in the interest of finding product\u002Fmarket fit. Launching a token at this stage is not advisable because it could trip compliance wires. Dependence on the core team&#8217;s efforts is one way a token might be deemed a security under the Howey Test, and thinking about this is a distraction from product development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of a core team controlling all aspects of a project may ruffle the feathers of some early users, but founders shouldn’t be wary of this. If users are complaining about the control you&#8217;ve got, that&#8217;s actually a good problem to have! It means someone cares about what you&#8217;ve built. That said, it&#8217;s important to communicate clearly about where control exists. Faking autonomy is a quick way to undermine trust, whereas transparency is a way to build it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Objective 2: Community Participation\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt early signs of product traction — a growing user base, developer ecosystem and network effects — it&#8217;s time to start devoting more cycles to fostering harmony between passive users, more-active contributors and the core team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, founders might invest more heavily in best practices for running the product like an open source project: invest in good documentation; develop openly; offer bounties, grants or other incentives for third-party development; hire community leaders to help steward open development; and introduce\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftools.ietf.org\u002Fhtml\u002Frfc7282\"\u003E rough consensus\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on decision making.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing further, it may make sense to start eliminating platform risk through imposed technical constraints. For example, in Compound v2.2,\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fcompound-finance\u002Fupgrading-compound-governance-c56b55a2996c\"\u003E upgrades take effect 48 hours after they are pushed\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, allowing time for users to exit the protocol, or review and voice dissent.

But as you go about engaging community members, it&#8217;s important to revisit incentives. Why will community members contribute to the product on an ongoing basis?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EIncentives (Fees)\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn economic incentive is one way to engender community contribution. But where do the economics come from? A pragmatic and familiar business model for crypto services is a fee-per-call, similar to an API micro-service like Twilio or Stripe. Distributing this fee stream to active contributors can align the community around the project’s success.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat said, fees don&#8217;t always make sense at the outset of a project. Given that crypto services are open source, it may be better to introduce fees only once there are strong network effects, resulting in defensibility through switching costs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Funiswap.exchange\u002F\"\u003EUniswap\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a decentralized exchange, is an example of how a crypto application with a fee can be protected by the power of its network effects. In Uniswap, the more users that contribute liquidity to an exchange pair, the better the pricing for traders. In order to provide the same pricing in a fee-free fork, you&#8217;d need to coordinate all the liquidity providers and third-party services integrated with the original to start using said fork. The cost of coordinating all that is a switching cost. While such switching costs are lower in crypto where data is open, they still do exist. In crypto, however, protocols must remain \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.placeholder.vc\u002Fblog\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F6\u002Fprotocols-as-minimally-extractive-coordinators\"\u003Eminimally extractive\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (in other words, they cover relevant costs rather than seek to maximize profit) in order to incentivize community contribution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDistribution (Tokens)\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETokens are an instrument for effectively distributing the fundamental value of a project, including a fee stream. While token distribution can incent participation and help build defensibility, it’s important to consider how to construct a distribution that is both fair and effective.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany ICOs and airdrops were suboptimal in that they invited unengaged communities and regulatory scrutiny. Crypto applications that focus on product\u002Fmarket fit have an opportunity to do better, by distributing tokens to an already active user base.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, teams might test a distribution with a managed and permissioned group of community members. A number of teams have elected to do this by allocating a slice of future tokens to early “power” contributors, for example through testnet programs where independent community members can register to participate in operating a node. A promissory and managed token distribution to users that contribute valuable work can help eliminate community dependency on the effort of founding teams.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, teams need to plan how remaining tokens will be distributed to participants, both fairly for past contributions, and effectively as a future incentive for ongoing participation\u003Cb\u003E.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E The distribution design needs to consider the core team that built the product, as well as the users that make it useful. Getting this right is hard, and will always be specific to the application in question, but some common questions to think through are:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWhat percentage of tokens should be allocated to the initial team and cap table?\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHow will you reward different types of contributors to the product or service, historically and in the future?\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHow will technology leadership be rewarded going forward?\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnswering these requires analysis of community behavior, modeling of rational outcomes and workshopping proposals with community members.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Objective 3: Sufficient Decentralization \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you’re a crypto founder and are ready for this stage, that means you have achieved early product\u002Fmarket fit, built a robust community capable of successfully maintaining the application, and mapped out a model that properly incentivizes sustainable operations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow for the last and final step on the journey to sufficient decentralization: a widespread token distribution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn practice, I imagine teams will &#8220;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fhackernoon.com\u002Fstartups-need-a-new-option-exit-to-community-ig12v2z73\"\u003Eexit to the community\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&#8221; by airdropping tokens to users and contributors based on the plan mapped out in the prior objective. This would happen the moment a smart contract is triggered to mint and distribute tokens. Optimally, once this function is triggered a number of things will have happened:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe core team will have ceded majority ownership of the application (fees and control) and mitigated platform risk by ensuring the product is community-owned and operated.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe token may have transmuted to a non-security, given that the service is now sufficiently decentralized — that is, independent of the efforts of a single entity that might have asymmetric information.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe company is sustainable, having retained enough tokens to benefit from fees and growth.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUser-owners realize increasing returns to scale, as the cooperative economics of the service allow for better alignment and growing value (as defined by users rather than shareholders.)\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe spirit of this objective is to mark a specific moment where a crypto product company completes its journey from traditional product team to sustainable community-owned-and-operated network. (Conducting a token distribution always requires careful legal review, and there is little precedent for what I’m describing, so please consult a lawyer first!)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]How to Avoid Getting Stuck\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot of teams have gotten stuck by tackling these objectives in the wrong order, &#8220;faking&#8221; decentralization, or by trying to do everything at once.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, app teams that pursue community ownership first (starting with a wide token distribution) risk engendering a community of speculators, rather than real users. Without a working product, ownership is worthless, and the community won&#8217;t stick. Many teams that have done this are unable to back into product\u002Fmarket fit, and as a result have a hard time kickstarting meaningful community participation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother sequencing risk is jumping straight from early signs of product\u002Fmarket fit to decentralized community ownership (skipping objective 2, community participation.) Failing to formalize \u003Ci\u003Ereal\u003C\u002Fi\u003E community participation can land projects in an uncanny valley of decentralization theater. A symptom of being caught here is an apathetic community with low participation rates, and a heavy dependency on founding teams. In this situation, formalizing control (e.g. through delegation) may be a better path to building trust, whereas hiding under the pretense of decentralization is a quick way to undermine it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to get stuck is to aim to do all three things at once. Lack of focus is the death of most startups, and the same is true for crypto applications. Each of these objectives overlap and needs to be considered holistically, as part of an idea maze, but execution needs to be sequenced and prioritized, not attempted at once.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, it’s worth noting that even if you do the steps in order, once you flip the switch to full community ownership, you&#8217;re in fairly uncharted territory in terms of governing the application. Scaling effective community decision-making is challenging, but if internet communities can accomplish feats like Wikipedia, I&#8217;m optimistic that experimentation and skin-in-the-game (via valuable ownership) can lead to cooperative decision-making at unprecedented scale.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo far, we have yet to see a crypto application execute each of the objectives sequentially, but the most promising project teams I’ve spoken with have been navigating their way through this playbook. Through those conversations, I&#8217;ve come to believe that progressive decentralization offers teams the most auspicious path to finding product\u002Fmarket fit, financial sustainability, a participatory community and regulatory compliance — in that order.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2020\u002F01\u002FScreen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-2.06.12-PM.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-297589 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2020\u002F01\u002FScreen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-2.06.12-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1414\" height=\"1162\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E— \u003C\u002Fi\u003EThanks to Robert Leshner, Hayden Adams, Alexis Gouba, Dan Robinson, Ali Yahya, Denis Nazarov and Toby Shorin for conversations that helped me think through these ideas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

class=\"wp-content tombstone-enable\"\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does it mean to say that a cryptonetwork is decentralized? A quick Twitter search suggests that it has to do with how many computers are running in it, the number of miners keeping it secure, their respective hashing power, or the degree to which such things are all geographically strewn about. It’s true that these things have often been correlated with decentralization, but they are a far cry from its definition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome have gone as far as to argue that the term has outlived its own usefulness; that it has become fuzzy and come to mean one too many things to mean anything at all. Admittedly, that does often feel true. But I argue that the term is still useful and can be saved. It helps us talk and reason about one of the most important aspects of networks: their power structure. So rather than ditching the word, we should focus it and reclaim it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELast year, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@VitalikButerin\u002Fthe-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274\"\u003EVitalik suggested\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that “decentralization” can be used to describe three different things about a cryptonetwork: (1) its physical architecture, (2) its logical data model, and (3) its power structure. I argue that only the third of these uses for the word is useful. It is this use that most people have in mind when casually expressing concern that one network or another is “too centralized”. And, it gets to the heart of what cryptonetworks are all about––they matter because they unlock new mechanisms for decentralizing power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what about Vitalik’s two other uses? It’s important to talk about those things too. However, better terms in Computer Science already exist to talk about distributed architectures and logical data models. Terms like \u003Cem\u003Eredundant\u003C\u002Fem\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Efault tolerant\u003C\u002Fem\u003E better describe what Vitalik called “architectural decentralization”, and adjectives like \u003Cem\u003Eunified\u003C\u002Fem\u003Eare better suited than “centralized” to talk about the data model of blockchains. So let’s narrow and sharpen the way we think of decentralization; it is all about power and control.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn that spirit, I propose the following definition:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe degree to which power and control over a network is distributed across a \u003Cem\u003Elarge\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, \u003Cem\u003Erepresentative\u003C\u002Fem\u003E base of \u003Cem\u003Eindependent\u003C\u002Fem\u003E human actors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe words \u003Cem\u003Elarge\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, \u003Cem\u003Eindependent\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, and \u003Cem\u003Erepresentative\u003C\u002Fem\u003E are key. The set of actors with power over the network must be \u003Cem\u003Elarge\u003C\u002Fem\u003E because otherwise the network is vulnerable to centralizing forces like collusion and bribery. A large number of actors alone is of no good, however, if their actions happen to already be under the influence of a single company or person. Those actors must also be \u003Cem\u003Eindependent\u003C\u002Fem\u003E from one another. But even independence is not enough. A network is still centralized if the interests of those with power (e.g. miners) are misaligned with the interests of those without (e.g. users). In order for a network to be fully decentralized, the interests of those who control it must be \u003Cem\u003Erepresentative\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of everyone in the network as a whole.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis definition is, of course, idealistic. There is no such thing as perfect decentralization, only hopeful aspirations for it. Like all good things in life and engineering, it does not come for free. There are unavoidable tradeoffs and widely different approaches to navigating them. All of this makes the concept of decentralization complex. Not to mention that, because hierarchies of power are often concealed, it is also hard to quantify (though \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnews.earn.com\u002Fquantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e\"\u003Egood strides\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to that end have been made). It is still, however, useful as a concept.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s make this usefulness more concrete by breaking down the kinds of things it can refer to. There are four different kinds of power that people can wield over a network. Each one of them is a force that can lead it to become centralized. Let’s call them The Four Horsemen of Centralization (:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\"thegatekeeper\"\u003EThe Gatekeeper\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gatekeepers of a network are the sentries who control access. They are those with the power to decide who gets to participate. The word “participate” here is deliberately left abstract. It could refer to a user’s ability to use the network, to contribute to it and get paid (e.g. as a miner or validator), or to any other kind of interaction with the network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, a fully decentralized cryptonetwork would have no gatekeepers; or, in other words, it should be \u003Cem\u003Epermissionless\u003C\u002Fem\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Ecensorship resistant\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Eliminating gatekeepers completely, however, is unrealistic. Let’s look at some examples.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn one end of the spectrum, a fully centralized network like say, Facebook, clearly has a single and all-powerful gatekeeper––Facebook. It has absolute control over who gets to participate. This is the obvious base case. The presence of gatekeepers in cryptonetworks is often more subtle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECertain networks, for example, might appear to be decentralized, but actually rely on a kind of master list (known as a whitelist) that dictates who gets to participate. Being or not being on the list might completely determine whether you get to be user or a miner on the network. If the whitelist is under the control of single group or individual, then the network has a centralized gatekeeper.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoving along the spectrum: Cryptonetworks based on Proof-of-Work (PoW) like Bitcoin and Ethereum are designed to have no gatekeepers. In theory, anyone, anywhere should be able to participate without anyone’s permission. If, however, the hashing power in the network becomes concentrated in hands of only a handful of miners, then that group can begin to exclude transactions from certain users or even entire blocks from other miners. Similarly, the hardware manufacturers who control the production of the chips required to meaningfully participate as a miner can likewise become gatekeepers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProof-of-Stake (PoS) networks have some advantage over PoW because no special hardware is required to participate as a validator, but they are also vulnerable to censorship if too much of the stake in the network is controlled by a handful of validators.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, exchanges and other points of integration that connect cryptonetworks to the rest of the world also wield varying degrees of power as gatekeepers for both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake networks alike.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\"theenforcer\"\u003EThe Enforcer\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you might imagine, the Enforcers in the network are responsible for enforcing the rules. They are the people in the network who actually run the code that secures it. Their work, in most cases, is driven by economic incentives. Miners in PoW cryptonetworks, for example, receive block rewards and fees in exchange for validating transactions and contributing hashing power to the network. The power that Enforcers wield is the kind power that most people are thinking about when they talk about the centralization of mining, or centralization of consensus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the ideal case, the power that Enforcers can wield over the network is strictly limited to enforcing the rules of the protocol. If Enforcement power is \u003Cem\u003Edecentralized\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (as per our definition above), then independent Enforcers will keep one another in check. But, of course, if too much of this kind of power becomes concentrated in the hands of a small number of people (i.e. centralized), then Enforcers can begin to bend the rules or, in extreme cases, break them completely (as with double spend attacks).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGatekeepers and Enforcers are often one and the same, but there are cases in which they aren’t. Cryptonetworks that are gated by whitelists, for example, might have a single Gatekeeper (she who controls the whitelist), but many Enforcers (those who are included in the whitelist).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\"thearchitect\"\u003EThe Architect\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Architects of a network are those who have the power to change its rules. They are the ones who have influence over the network’s \u003Cem\u003Egovernance\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Their presence and integrity is crucial for the network to evolve.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EArchitects come in many different shapes and forms. Some of them wield power directly by determining what changes make it into the protocol’s codebase(s) or by voting with their tokens whenever governance is done on-chain. Others wield power indirectly through their influence in the network’s community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with the other archetypes, it’s important that Architects keep one another in check and for them be \u003Cem\u003Erepresentative\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of everyone else in the network. In many ways, this is the most important kind of power, for it can easily be transformed into the other kinds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\"theprofiteer\"\u003EThe Profiteer\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe profiteers in a network are, quite simply, those who profit from its rules. Maybe the rules state that they are entitled to some percentage of the network’s original supply of tokens or, in some cases, to a fraction of the tokens minted thereafter for some time (known as a “founder’s reward”).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis kind of power often manifests itself indirectly through wealth; it affords its holders influence over the three other archetypes. Profiteers also wield some degree of power over the markets in which the network’s crypto-assets are traded, for their activity often moves markets. And, in networks where token holders have the ability to vote on questions of governance, Profiteers might also easily become Architects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is undoubtedly true that powerful entities within networks invariably wield some combination of all four kinds of power. It is also true that absolute power of any one kind, can likely be transmuted into power of the three other kinds. All kinds of power must therefore be decentralized in order for the network as a whole to be decentralized in turn.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, the question that matters when thinking about decentralization is the following:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho exactly do you have to trust to believe that your interactions with a network will be fair?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe vision that underlies the crypto movement suggests that the answer to this question should be “nobody”; that is, that the network should function in a way that is completely “trustless” and self-policing. But of course, in practice, there is no such thing as perfect decentralization. There is always someone, somewhere who wields a little bit too much power and has to be trusted, at least to a degree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing is clear: decentralization is a high-dimensional concept. It is important for us to figure out ways to clearly talk about the different kinds of power that people can wield over a network. It will clarify our trust assumptions and will, thereby, help us build better cryptonetworks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fteam\u002Fali-yahya\"\u003EAli Yahya\u003C\u002Fa\u003E is a General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz where he invests in crypto. Before joining Andreessen Horowitz, he was a software engineer and researcher at Google X, where he worked on the Everyday Robot project, which aims to build a robot that is smart and affordable enough to be viable as a consumer product for the home.

This meant that people or organizations could grow their internet presence knowing the rules of the game wouldn’t change later on. Huge web properties were started during this era including Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. In the process, the importance of centralized platforms like AOL greatly diminished.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the second era of the internet, from the mid 2000s to the present, for-profit tech companies — most notably Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) — built software and services that rapidly outpaced the capabilities of open protocols. The explosive growth of smartphones accelerated this trend as mobile apps became the majority of internet use. Eventually users migrated from open services to these more sophisticated, centralized services. Even when users still accessed open protocols like the web, they would typically do so mediated by GAFA software and services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that billions of people got access to amazing technologies, many of which were free to use. The bad news is that it became much harder for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presence without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them, taking away their audiences and profits. This in turn stifled innovation, making the internet less interesting and dynamic. Centralization has also created broader societal tensions, which we see in the debates over subjects like fake news, state sponsored bots, “no platforming” of users, EU privacy laws, and algorithmic biases. These debates will only intensify in the coming years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E“Web 3”: the third era of the internet\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne response to this centralization is to impose government regulation on large internet companies. This response assumes that the internet is similar to past communication networks like the phone, radio, and TV networks. But the hardware-based networks of the past are fundamentally different than the internet, a software-based network. Once hardware-based networks are built, they are nearly impossible to rearchitect. Software-based networks can be rearchitected through entrepreneurial innovation and market forces.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is the ultimate software-based network, consisting of a relatively simple \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FInternet_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecore layer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E connecting billions of fully programmable computers at the edge. Software is simply the encoding of human thought, and as such has an almost unbounded design space. Computers connected to the internet are, by and large, free to run whatever software their owners choose. Whatever can be dreamt up, with the right set of incentives, can quickly propagate across the internet. Internet architecture is where technical creativity and incentive design intersect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is still early in its evolution: the core internet services will likely be almost entirely rearchitected in the coming decades. This will be enabled by crypto-economic networks, a generalization of the ideas first introduced in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbitcoin.org\u002Fbitcoin.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBitcoin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and further developed in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fethereum\u002Fwiki\u002Fwiki\u002FWhite-Paper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEthereum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy decentralization?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization is a commonly misunderstood concept. For example, it is sometimes said that the reason cryptonetwork advocates favor decentralization is to resist government censorship, or because of libertarian political views. These are not the main reasons decentralization is important.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s look at the problems with centralized platforms. Centralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. When they start out, they do everything they can to recruit users and 3rd-party complements like developers, businesses, and media organizations. They do this to make their services more valuable, as platforms (by definition) are systems with multi-sided network effects. As platforms move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and 3rd parties steadily grows.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8389 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG.png 681w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG-300x129.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing lies in extracting data from users and competing with complements over audiences and profits. Historical examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, and Twitter vs. its 3rd-party clients. Operating systems like iOS and Android have behaved better, although still take a healthy 30% tax, reject apps for seemingly arbitrary reasons, and subsume the functionality of 3rd-party apps at will.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor 3rd parties, this transition from cooperation to competition feels like a bait-and-switch. Over time, the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors have become wary of building on top of centralized platforms. We now have decades of evidence that doing so will end in disappointment. In addition, users give up privacy, control of their data, and become vulnerable to security breaches. These problems with centralized platforms will likely become even more pronounced in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EEnter cryptonetworks\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptonetworks are networks built on top of the internet that 1) use consensus mechanisms such as blockchains to maintain and update state, 2) use cryptocurrencies (coins\u002Ftokens) to incentivize consensus participants (miners\u002Fvalidators) and other network participants. Some cryptonetworks, such as Ethereum, are general programming platforms that can be used for almost any purpose. Other cryptonetworks are special purpose, for example Bitcoin is intended primarily for storing value, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgolem.network\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGolem\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for performing computations, and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffilecoin.io\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFilecoin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for decentralized file storage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly internet protocols were technical specifications created by working groups or non-profit organizations that relied on the alignment of interests in the internet community to gain adoption. This method worked well during the very early stages of the internet but since the early 1990s very few new protocols have gained widespread adoption. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F18\u002F2017\u002F05\u002F27\u002Fcrypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECryptonetworks fix\u003C\u002Fa\u003E these problems by providing economics incentives to developers, maintainers, and other network participants in the form of tokens. They are also much more technically robust. For example, they are able to keep state and do arbitrary transformations on that state, something past protocols could never do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptonetworks use multiple mechanisms to ensure that they stay neutral as they grow, preventing the bait-and-switch of centralized platforms. First, the contract between cryptonetworks and their participants is enforced in open source code. Second, they are kept in check through mechanisms for \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FExit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E“voice” and “exit.”\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Participants are given voice through community governance, both “on chain” (via the protocol) and “off chain” (via the social structures around the protocol). Participants can exit either by leaving the network and selling their coins, or in the extreme case by forking the protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, cryptonetworks align network participants to work together toward a common goal — the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This alignment is one of the main reasons Bitcoin continues to defy skeptics and flourish, even while new cryptonetworks like Ethereum have grown alongside it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday’s cryptonetworks suffer from limitations that keep them from seriously challenging centralized incumbents. The most severe limitations are around performance and scalability. The next few years will be about fixing these limitations and building networks that form the infrastructure layer of the crypto stack. After that, most of the energy will turn to building applications on top of that infrastructure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow decentralization wins\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s one thing to say decentralized networks should win, and another thing to say they will win. Let’s look at specific reasons to be optimistic about this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware and web services are built by developers. There are millions of highly skilled developers in the world. Only a small fraction work at large technology companies, and only a small fraction of those work on new product development. Many of the most important software projects in history were created by startups or by communities of independent developers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.” — \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FJoy%27s_law_(management)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBill Joy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized networks can win the third era of the internet for the same reason they won the first era: by winning the hearts and minds of entrepreneurs and developers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn illustrative analogy is the rivalry in the 2000s between Wikipedia and its centralized competitors like Encarta. If you compared the two products in the early 2000s, Encarta was a far better product, with better topic coverage and higher accuracy. But Wikipedia improved at a much faster rate, because it had an active community of volunteer contributors who were attracted to its decentralized, community-governed ethos. By 2005, Wikipedia was the most \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@cdixon\u002Fit-s-hard-to-believe-today-but-10-years-ago-wikipedia-was-widely-considered-a-doomed-experiment-a7a0dfd27b8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epopular\u003C\u002Fa\u003E reference site on the internet. Encarta was shut down in 2009.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lesson is that when you compare centralized and decentralized systems you need to consider them dynamically, as processes, instead of statically, as rigid products. Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of cryptonetworks, there are multiple, compounding feedback loops involving developers of the core protocol, developers of complementary cryptonetworks, developers of 3rd party applications, and service providers who operate the network. These feedback loops are further amplified by the incentives of the associated token, which — as we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum — can supercharge the rate at which crypto communities develop (and sometimes lead to negative outcomes, as with the excessive electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question of whether decentralized or centralized systems will win the next era of the internet reduces to who will build the most compelling products, which in turn reduces to who will get more high quality developers and entrepreneurs on their side. GAFA has many advantages, including cash reserves, large user bases, and operational infrastructure. Cryptonetworks have a significantly more attractive value proposition to developers and entrepreneurs. If they can win their hearts and minds, they can mobilize far more resources than GAFA, and rapidly outpace their product development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“If you asked people in 1989 what they needed to make their life better, it was unlikely that they would have said a decentralized network of information nodes that are linked using hypertext.” — \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffarmerandfarmer.org\u002Fmastery\u002Fbuilder.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFarmer &amp; Farmer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECentralized platforms often come bundled at launch with compelling apps: Facebook had its core socializing features and the iPhone had a number of key apps. Decentralized platforms, by contrast, often launch half-baked and without clear use cases. As a result, they need to go through two phases of product-market fit: 1) product-market fit between the platform and the developers\u002Fentrepreneurs who will finish the platform and build out the ecosystem, and 2) product-market fit between the platform\u002Fecosystem and end users. This two-stage process is what causes many people — including sophisticated technologists — to consistently underestimate the potential of decentralized platforms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe next era of the internet\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized networks aren’t a silver bullet that will fix all the problems on the internet. But they offer a much better approach than centralized systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECompare the problem of Twitter spam to the problem of email spam. Since Twitter \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theverge.com\u002F2012\u002F8\u002F23\u002F3263481\u002Ftwitter-api-third-party-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eclosed\u003C\u002Fa\u003E their network to 3rd-party developers, the only company working on Twitter spam has been Twitter itself. By contrast, there were hundreds of companies that tried to fight email spam, financed by billions of dollars in venture capital and corporate funding. Email spam isn’t solved, but it’s a lot better now, because 3rd parties knew that the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FSimple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eemail protocol\u003C\u002Fa\u003E was decentralized, so they could build businesses on top of it without worrying about the rules of the game changing later on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr consider the problem of network governance. Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms. As we know from the offline world, democratic systems aren’t perfect, but they are a lot better than the alternatives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECentralized platforms have been dominant for so long that many people have forgotten there is a better way to build internet services. Cryptonetworks are a powerful way to develop community-owned networks and provide a level playing field for 3rd-party developers, creators, and businesses. We saw the value of decentralized systems in the first era of the internet. Hopefully we’ll get to see it again in the next.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

That’s because they both fall under a 1946 Supreme Court decision: SEC v W.J. Howey Co (“\u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E”), which dealt with oranges &#8212; or more specifically, a services contract offered by a company known as Howey-in-the-Hills Service to produce, harvest, and market orange crops in Lake County, Florida. Many of the purchasers of these contracts were tourists who happened to be staying at a nearby hotel owned by the W.J. Howey Company, and who received a sales pitch touting the investment profits to be earned from successfully cultivating the orange groves. Although the purchasers would buy the land directly, some would also enter into a services contract with Howey-in-the-Hills by which the company would manage the full harvesting process and sales for the oranges.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question for the Supreme Court was whether the purchase + services contracts created an “investment contract”; if so, they would be regulated as a security. The Supreme Court said yes, and in doing so laid out what has now become known as the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E Test for determining whether things that don’t look like securities can in fact be deemed securities:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ethere is an investment of money;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ewith an expectation of profits;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ewhere that expectation of profits derives largely from the efforts of others.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E[There is a fourth prong to the test known as “common enterprise”, but its significance as an independent prong is heavily debated in the legal community, so we’ll ignore it for now.]\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E did not say that the oranges grown under these contracts could also be deemed securities.

For example, if you enter into a contract to purchase a condo pre-construction and, as part of that contract, the developer promises to do a bunch of work on the condo and provides ongoing services post-construction to increase the value of the condo, you likely have entered into an investment contract &#8212; a.k.a. a security. But, that contract doesn’t convert the underlying condo itself into a security. It’s still just a condo; when you want to sell the condo to someone else, you don’t need to comply with the securities laws. Thus, the buyer can’t sue you for securities fraud if the Spanish tile in the entryway didn’t actually come from Spain.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fundamental principle here is that the nature of an investment contract can be distinct from the nature \u003Cem\u003Eof the object\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of that investment contract.

They arise from cryptocurrency movements (like Bitcoin and Ethereum), but the fundamental shift between these and previous internet-based economies is the creation of \u003Cem\u003Eopen, decentralized\u003C\u002Fem\u003E networks and protocols. An example of a past such protocol is SMTP, which enables email; even though Microsoft owns Hotmail and Google owns Gmail, no one company owns the email-enabling protocol itself. Numerous companies can therefore build on top of it without being proprietarily blocked by Microsoft and Google or having to ask permission from the original developers.

Yes: Anyone else who invests at this time is doing so with real money.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAre people investing money with an expectation of profit? Yes: The investor is hoping to get paid at some point based on the eventual appreciation of the network token when and if the network becomes functional.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIs that expectation of profits based on the efforts of others? Yes: In order for the investor to realize profit, the “others” (in this case the sponsor of the network) need to actually build the network.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnder this framework, a contract where someone provides money to the network sponsor before the network is built &#8212; in exchange for a promise to receive tokens at some point in the future &#8212; is likely an investment contract; current U.S. securities laws would apply for the token offering.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next milestone after Pre-Network is further in the lifecycle: a \u003Cstrong\u003EFunctional Network\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. In its simplest form, “functional” should mean that the network does what the sponsor said it was designed to do. Did those who invested money in the pre-network stage based solely on a whitepaper really get the “efforts of others” (i.e., the network sponsor) &#8212; which they were relying on to have a shot at realizing a return on their investment?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne complication that arises here due to the inherent difference between oranges and other such hard(ware) products is that software is never really \u003Cem\u003Edone\u003C\u002Fem\u003E; after all, bug fixes and updates can go on for the lifetime of a software service. So, the “functional” assessment at this stage isn’t about whether another line of code is ever written, but rather, whether the network can do what it was promoted to do &#8212; can users utilize a token on the network for some specific purpose; can miners verify transactions on the network; and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn applying the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E test to Functional Networks, there are different constituents to consider:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUsers of the network\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E These users are investing some money in tokens for the functional utility of those tokens on the network &#8212; not with an expectation of profit (or investment intent). For example, people who want to buy storage on a network, or get early access to a particular application, or other such use cases. Thus, under \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, these tokens are not securities. This is not unlike the juicers who make orange juice from oranges.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMiners of the network\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E But what about “miners” (and validators, in proof-of-stake systems) &#8212; those who contribute computational resources (hardware\u002Felectricity, other effort) to verify transactions on the network? These users\u002Fentities are effectively \u003Cem\u003Eservice providers\u003C\u002Fem\u003E who take on this expensive computational work in exchange for tokens. Whether or not those users also speculate on those tokens is a separate matter; and in fact, in proof-of-stake systems, they are required to hold and bond their own tokens as a way to align incentives (more skin in the game) for validating transactions correctly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProof-of-work miners technically haven’t made an “investment of money” in obtaining their tokens, beyond of course the capital\u002Ftools and time required to provide the service. And while proof-of-stake miners (validators) do have to purchase some tokens in order to participate in the network, it’s a buy-in (the “stake”) that enables them to become active service providers on the network. However, in a very different line of cases from the 1990s, the SEC has taken the position that “investment of money” doesn’t always have to involve an exchange of money. For example, when a brewery gave a free share of its stock to anyone who purchased a case of beer, the SEC argued that there was a value exchange of some kind even though the customers didn’t pay out of pocket for the stock itself. And in other cases, the SEC has argued that “paying” with property or services may also satisfy the “investment of money” prong of \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Thus, it’s worth keeping this prior \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E context in mind when distinguishing the role of miners\u002Fvalidators in cryptonetworks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, is there also an “expectation of profit”? Obviously, miners don’t provide expensive computational resources for nothing &#8212; also note, as described earlier, that lack of steady computational resources is where previous decentralized networks failed. But compared to the speculators who bought cases of beer in the 1990s in exchange for stock, miners\u002Fvalidators are more like a UPS, moving packages for Amazon’s network; they’re more in the business of running tight operations &#8212; and therefore need to generate cash now &#8212; than in the business of speculating about future prices (though some of them might be).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of this means we need to turn to the “efforts of others” prong of the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E test to complete the analysis. This is where the definition of “functional” really matters: If the network is functional and its success &#8212; and thus the realization of profit &#8212; is no longer substantially dependent on the creator\u002Fsponsor, but rather on the market’s demand for the functioning utility of the network, then we’re no longer relying on the “efforts of others”. Of course, the network sponsor may still be involved in the network by doing software updates and bug fixes. But under \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, the tokens themselves in functional networks should not represent investment contracts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EReceivers of airdrops\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E One other example to consider are those who get tokens via an “airdrop”, which for our purposes means they received tokens directly from the network sponsor without paying for them. These airdrops can range from benign gifts to early supporters, to a fraudulent scam (not unlike phishing, where someone is trying to get someone else’s credit card data for instance). More often, though, airdrops are word-of-mouth marketing and awareness campaigns for ICOs and new cryptonetworks. While the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E analysis for airdrops could be similar to what we described above for miners, there is no investment of resources of any kind on the part of those who receive them (although some have suggested that registering on a website and giving up contact details would be enough of a value transfer to count as consideration for the purchaser of otherwise free tokens).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the bigger picture here is that airdrops are more than just free tokens. They can be used to help seed or set the tone for a cryptonetwork; for example, by drawing in coders and users (making it a more developer focused network) as opposed to say, speculators (price-focused) as token holders. Because the networks that win will be the ones that cut through the hype and come to market with functional code, building the right community early on is critical to success.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThose who invested pre-network\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E Coming full circle, what about those investment contracts purchased in the Pre-Network phase? Those contracts were indeed securities when purchased, but what if those investors now want to receive the tokens that underlie that contract &#8212; are the tokens themselves then securities?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince the nature of an investment contract (orange plots\u002Fservices) can be distinct from the nature of the object of the investment contract (the oranges themselves), the nature of the token itself &#8212; not the token sale agreement &#8212; would need to be analyzed under the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E test. If the profit expectation for a token in a functional network is not substantially reliant on the efforts of others (i.e., the network sponsor), then the token itself may not be a security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first blush, this may seem odd &#8212; that a contract for a to-be-built token could be a security, but not the token itself? Yet it’s exactly what the securities laws were intended to protect: If network sponsors lie about what they’re building or otherwise try to sell me a bill of goods, I have recourse to sue them under the securities laws (as does the SEC) because the contract I purchased is a security. I can’t realize my profit expectation if they don’t deliver on their promises; as a pre-network investor, I am completely reliant on the sponsor promises that induced me to buy the contract in the first place. But once that contract falls away based upon the network sponsor’s completion of the critical work, the network sponsor has no further obligations to me, and the value of the underlying token itself\u002F success of the network no longer wholly relies on or is primarily attributable to them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the pre-network and functional stages, the final stage in the developmental lifecycle of some crypto networks is that they become \u003Cstrong\u003EFully Decentralized\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Not only does the network deliver its intended functionality, but at this stage the network sponsor no longer has unilateral control of the network itself. Because the code and data is all open and therefore able to be forked, the network can go in different directions &#8212; and different versions can operate under different rules (as well as different governance models and mechanisms for voting).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are other features of decentralized networks as well, but the key point here is that a truly decentralized network is largely at the mercy of \u003Cem\u003Ethe community\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to determine its future functionality. With cryptonetworks, there are a number of foundations and companies contributing to the development and improvement of the shared infrastructure. With Internet 1.0 protocols (such as HTTP, etc.) there do remain somewhat centralized standards bodies (like the W3C consortium) responsible for the upgrade and maintenance of the protocols. But, the value of network resources (like domain names or websites\u002Fcompanies built on top of the network) don’t depend on the actions and decisions of these groups. So for all intents and purposes those protocols act as if decentralized. For cryptonetworks, there are multiple organizations, not just one, all freely delivering different proposals and solutions; people are not just dependent on one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith more mature cryptonetworks, the profits (if any) of a token holder are no longer reliant in any material way on “the efforts” of &#8212; in \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E test terms &#8212; the network sponsor. The actions of network sponsors, working groups\u002F standard bodies, or other maintainers shouldn’t significantly affect that value. Those cryptonetworks are now instead subject to broad market forces, much like other commodities and futures. A useful conceptual analogy here is gold: Think of the future, more mature phase of cryptonetworks as separating the company that mines the gold (whose value is dependent on both the effort of others as well as the price of the commodity) from the gold itself (valued on the price of the commodity alone). If the network provides utility that has value to users, the token should appreciate in value based on market conditions; if not, the value could fall.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E*    *    *\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big picture here is about the evolution of networks &#8212; and about blockchains and tokens as key tools for incentivizing the creation, coordination, and maintenance of &#8220;community owned and operated digital services&#8221; built on top of those networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there’s something else to keep in mind here about the inherent nature of this technology, and how it’s a difference of \u003Cem\u003Ekind\u003C\u002Fem\u003E not just degree: the role of “smart contracts”. These digital contracts are self-validating (“smart”) &#8212; they don’t require, say, a notary or other middlemen at center (they’re decentralized) &#8212; so the entire network of distributed computers essentially runs itself, by executing code submitted by developers within rules embedded in the protocols of these networks (“contracts”).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERegulatory compliance plays out very differently in this more mature and functional context. This is because these smart contracts are also \u003Cem\u003Ebuilding blocks\u003C\u002Fem\u003E on which a larger ecosystem of digital services &#8212; from file storage to games to medical records to many more &#8212; may operate. Transactions are ideally executed at the level of milliseconds; adding layers of compliance could halt these innovations altogether as they would not scale. Furthermore, there’s no reason for those builders to then try to compete with existing centralized services. No one would have used email if it had been much slower than mail. No one would buy or sell oranges if \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E had mandated that the regulatory framework for the investment contract (the plots\u002Fservices agreements) were the same as that for the object of that contract (the oranges). And so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHopefully a regulatory and security framework will evolve that takes into account the lifecycle of cryptonetworks, and incents strong teams with working open source code over ones with empty promises. Because the good actors in cryptoeconomic networks &#8212; developers, entrepreneurs, builders, investors &#8212; are focused on \u003Cem\u003Evalue creation\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, not just value extraction. They’re focused on building the next phase of the internet, which, if allowed to flourish, could create a more vibrant, open, and more inclusive internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n",1438,1510,"Regulating Crypto - Analogies and Considerations - a16z crypto","https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fconsiderations-for-regulating-cryptonetworks\u002F","Why decentralization matters",34,"Why decentralization matters - a16z crypto","https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fwhy-decentralization-matters\u002F")));
