The same can be said of governments. This is why centralization and consolidation are the norm today: See Big Government, Big Banks, Big Tech, and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch like gravity, centralization is a force that’s hard to resist. By comparison, decentralization &#8212; transferring control and power to distributed groups &#8212; is inefficient.

It’s been hard to pull off in practice, however, because the technologies to coordinate at scale haven’t been possible (or available to all).

Decentralization means asking entrepreneurs and developers to give up control of their projects and proceed by consensus, rather than by singular command-and-control. Decentralization means builders, creators, and investors  distribute ownership to other network participants, thereby diluting their own economic interest. Decentralization means actively inviting third-parties to build out a given network, thereby reducing the founders’ own importance, standing, and singular vision. All of these forces push against decentralization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the easiest and cheapest path to building with blockchain technology is to take shortcuts &#8212; or skip decentralization altogether.

Which books are better as movies and TV shows, and games too? Also, are collaboratively-filtered recommendations via family or friends really that great?

crypto prices reaching all-time highs again recently, there’s risk of too much speculation in the crypto markets, especially given recent buzz around memecoins. Why does the market keep repeating these cycles &#8212; instead of supporting the more productive blockchain-based innovations that will truly make a difference?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMemecoins are crypto tokens used mostly for humor, born of joining an online community that’s in on the joke. You’ve likely heard of Dogecoin, based on the old \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fknowyourmeme.com\u002Fmemes\u002Fdoge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edoge\u003C\u002Fa\u003E meme featuring images of Shiba Inu dogs. It emerged as a loose \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdogecoin.com\u002F#what-is-dogecoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecommunity\u003C\u002Fa\u003E online when someone ironically added a cryptocurrency that later had some financial value. This kind of “memecoin” embodies various facets of internet culture and is mostly harmless, while other memecoins \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2024-03-13\u002Fmemecoin-trading-volume-rises-to-levels-last-seen-before-crypto-bubble-burst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eare not\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut my goal here isn’t to defend or to diminish memecoins. It’s to point out the backwardness of a policy regime that lets memecoins thrive &#8212; while crypto companies and blockchain tokens with more productive use cases face hurdles. Any mememaker can easily create, launch, and even automatically list tokens, including tokens that derogate specific politicians and celebrities. But entrepreneurs trying to build something real and lasting? They get stuck in regulatory purgatory.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s actually safer to release a memecoin today with \u003Cem\u003Eno \u003C\u002Fem\u003Euse case, than it is to launch a token that’s \u003Cem\u003Euseful\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Think about it this way: We’d consider it a policy failure if we had a securities market that incentivized only GameStop \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftime.com\u002F6312307\u002Fgamestop-meme-stocks-dumb-money\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ememe stocks\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, but that rejected the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA &#8212; all companies with products people use daily. Yet current regulations encourage platforms to list memecoins and not other, more useful tokens. The lack of regulatory clarity in the crypto industry means platforms and entrepreneurs live under constant fear that the more productive blockchain token they are listing or developing could suddenly be deemed a security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI call the distinction between these more speculative and productive use cases in the crypto industry the “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fblockchain-culture-computer-vs-casino\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecomputer vs. the casino\u003C\u002Fa\u003E”. One culture (“the casino”) sees blockchains as a way to launch tokens primarily for trading and gambling. The other culture (“the computer”) is more interested in blockchains as a new platform for innovation, much like web, social, and mobile were before it. It is possible that a memecoin community could \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002Fdp2gbWsPFgY?si=wSa8kKQiNmqw-i2r&amp;t=43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eevolve\u003C\u002Fa\u003E its token by adding more utility over time; after all, many disruptive innovations we use today once started out looking like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2010\u002F01\u002F03\u002Fthe-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ea toy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. “Utility” matters because at its core, a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Ftokens-are-a-new-digital-primitive\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etoken is\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a new digital primitive that offer property rights online for anyone.

They could verify proof of authenticity to protect against deepfakes. They could allow more voice in, or the ability to exit, from a particular social network &#8212; especially if you don’t like the moderation policies or who those networks kick off and keep on. They could give users a vote in a platform’s decisions, especially if those users’ livelihoods are dependent on that platform. They could mark “proof of humanity” against artificial intelligence. Or they could just generally serve as a decentralizing counterbalance to the centralizing power of enterprises.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOur legal frameworks should be encouraging these kinds of innovations. So why are we prioritizing memes over matter? U.S. securities laws don’t empower the SEC to make merit-based judgments about an investment. Nor is it the SEC’s job to end speculation altogether. Instead, the agency’s role is to (1) protect investors; (2) maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and (3) facilitate capital formation. The SEC is failing across all three of these objectives when it comes to digital asset markets and tokens.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe primary test the SEC uses to determine whether or not something is a security is the 1946 \u003Cem\u003EHowey \u003C\u002Fem\u003Etest, which involves assessing a number of factors &#8212; including whether there is a \u003Cem\u003Ereasonable expectation of profits due to the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fcorpfin\u002Fframework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emanagerial efforts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of others\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Take for example Bitcoin and Ethereum: While both crypto projects began with the vision of a single person, they evolved into communities of developers with no one entity in control &#8212; so potential investors don’t have to rely on anyone’s “managerial efforts”. These technologies now function like public infrastructure rather than as proprietary platforms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, other entrepreneurs building innovative projects don’t know how to qualify for the same regulatory treatment as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin (founded in 2009) and Ethereum (2013-2014) are the only significant blockchain projects to date &#8212; both established over a decade ago &#8212; that the SEC has deemed, explicitly or implicitly, as not involving managerial efforts. The SEC’s lack of candor and approach &#8212; including applying the Howey test through regulation-by-enforcement &#8212; has also led to much confusion and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fits-time-to-move-crypto-from-chaos-to-order\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Euncertainty\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in the industry. And while the Howey test is well reasoned, it is inherently subjective. The SEC has so broadly stretched the test’s meaning that ordinary assets, even something like Nike shoes, could be considered securities today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMemecoin projects, meanwhile, don’t have developers, so there’s no pretense of memecoin investors relying on the “managerial efforts” of anyone. Memecoins thus propagate, while innovative projects struggle. Investors end up facing more risk, not less.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer isn’t less regulation &#8212; it’s \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C\u002Fem\u003E regulation. Specific solutions include adding well-tailored disclosures to provide regular investors with more information. Another solution is requiring long lockup periods to prevent get-rich-quick schemes, and incentivize more long-term building.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERegulators implemented similar protections following the Great Depression, after the excesses of the roaring 1920’s and stock market crash of 1929. Once those guiderails were in place, we saw an unprecedented era of growth and innovation in our markets and economy. It’s time for regulators to learn from the mistakes of the past, and pave the way towards a better future for all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe author is general partner at

Innovative web3 companies are now faced with the choices of “comply or die” or “dying by complying.” Call it “regulation by intimidation.” Never have I witnessed a more stark example of regulation-by-intimidation than the Securities and Exchange Commission’s current posture toward crypto, which is putting American innovation at risk.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EA principles-based model isn’t theoretical. In my more than 4 years as a Commissioner at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, I saw firsthand the benefits of a principles-based regulatory framework. The CFTC’s enabling statute, the Commodity Exchange Act, requires that many of the agency’s primary rules be principles-based rather than prescriptive. Its emphasis on outcomes-focused regulation encourages CFTC regulated entities to satisfy “core principles” in a manner tailored to their specific operations. The result is an adaptive set of regulatory solutions that firms explore under the close observation by, and in partnership with, regulators to ensure the agency’s full understanding of evolving market structure and a business’s scope, operations, risk, and regulatory outcomes.

This is no longer the case: networks controlled by the largest tech companies now reach billions, but entrepreneurs and creators have learned just how untrustworthy they can be. These businesses clamp down on application programming interfaces, meddle with mysterious algorithms, and rank content according to opaque and capricious policies. Worse, big tech companies claim most of the revenue that flows through their networks. This stifles creativity, making our online lives poorer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the economics of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Ftags\u002Fnetwork-effects\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enetwork effects\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: companies provide perks and easy-to-use tools to draw in users — and then, once they are locked in, switch to extracting value from them.

Others focus on reviving early internet protocols, such as plans for so-called federated networks (in which policies are enforced by a central framework), though these are not widely used.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA revitalized internet would require three properties. First, openness: being available to anyone, anywhere. Second, trust: the rules should be transparent, fair and dependable, so builders, creators and users know the network cannot yank the rug out from under them. Finally, all users — not just centralized gatekeepers — should have a say in the networks they contribute to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworks built on blockchains have all these attributes. While it’s easy to dismiss the technology because of its associations with casino-style gambling behavior — notably FTX and meme coins — it would be a mistake to ignore its potential.

note: This is an adapted excerpt from the just-released book \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Freadwriteown.com\u002F#order\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ERead Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by Chris Dixon. The book is now available in the U.S. and in the U.K. for English-language editions; more editions in other languages coming soon. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is probably the most important invention of the twentieth century. It transformed the world much as earlier technological revolutions &#8212; the printing press, the steam engine, electricity &#8212; did before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike many other inventions, the internet wasn’t immediately monetized. Its early architects created the network not as a centralized organization but as an open platform that anyone &#8212; artists, users, developers, companies, and others &#8212; could access equally. At a relatively low cost and without needing approval, anyone anywhere could create and share code, art, writing, music, games, websites, startups, or whatever else people could dream up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd whatever you created, you owned. As long as you obeyed the law, no one could change the rules on you, extract more money from you, or take away what you built. The internet was designed to be permissionless and democratically governed, as were its original networks: email and the web. No participants would be privileged over others. Anyone could build on top of these networks and control their creative and economic destinies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis freedom and sense of ownership led to a golden period of creativity and innovation that drove the growth of the internet, leading to countless applications that have transformed our world and the way we live, work, and play.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen, everything changed. Starting in the mid-2000s, a small group of companies wrenched control away. The internet got intermediated. The network went from permissionless to permissioned.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good news: Billions of people got access to amazing technologies, many of which were free to use. The bad news: A centralized internet run by a handful of mostly ad-based services meant people had fewer software choices, weakened data privacy, and diminished control over their online lives. It also became much harder for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presences without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them and taking away their audiences, profits, and power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though those platforms deliver significant value to people, they also control what we see and watch. The most visible example of this is deplatforming &#8212; where services eject people, usually without transparent due process. Alternatively, people may get silenced and not even know it &#8212; a practice called shadowbanning. Search and social ranking algorithms can change lives, make or break businesses, and even influence elections.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA subtler and equally troubling point is how these centralized networks restrict and constrain startups, impose high rents on creators, and disenfranchise users. The negative effects of their design choices stifle innovation, tax creativity, and concentrate power and money in the hands of a few.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially dangerous when you consider that the killer app of the internet \u003Cem\u003Eis \u003C\u002Fem\u003Enetworks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of what people do online involves networks: The web and email are networks. Social apps are networks. Payment apps are networks. Marketplaces are networks. Almost every useful online service is a network. Networks &#8212; computing networks, of course; but also developer platforms, marketplaces, financial networks, social networks, and all variety of communities coming together online &#8212; have always been a powerful part of the promise of the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers, entrepreneurs, and everyday internet users have nurtured and nourished tens of thousands of networks, unleashing an unprecedented wave of creation and coordination. Yet the networks that have lasted are mostly owned and controlled by private companies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem stems from \u003Cem\u003Epermission\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Today creators and startups need to ask for permission from centralized gatekeepers and incumbents to launch and grow new products. But dominant tech businesses leverage the power of permission to thwart competition, desolate markets, and extract rents. And those rents are exorbitant: App stores charge up to 30 percent for payments. That’s more than ten times the payment industry norm. Such steep take rates are unheard of in other markets, and they reflect how powerful these companies have become. That’s what we mean when we say corporate networks tax creativity. The taxation is literal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese big, centralized networks are ruthless, anticompetitive, and abuse their power. They squelch competitors, reducing options for consumers. By cutting off third parties that were building apps for users on top of their platforms, they punished many developers &#8212; and therefore punished users by offering fewer products, fewer choices, and less freedom. Today almost no new startup activity takes place on top of social networks. Developers know better than to lay foundations on quicksand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany people don’t see a problem with the way things are, are happy with the status quo, or don’t think much about it. They are satisfied with the comforts afforded by these centralized platforms and networks. We live in an age of abundance, after all. You can connect to anyone you want (assuming the corporate owners are okay with it). You can read, watch, and share as much as you like. There are plenty of “free” services to satiate us &#8212; the price of entry being just our data. (As they say, “If it’s free, then you’re the product.”)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you think the tradeoff is worth it &#8212; or perhaps you see no other viable alternative for life online. Either way, whatever your stance, one trend is undeniable: centralizing forces are drawing the internet inward, collecting power into the center of what was supposed to be a decentralized network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inward turn of the internet is stifling innovation, making it less interesting, less dynamic, and less fair.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo the extent that anyone recognizes a problem, they usually assume the only way to rein in existing giants is through government regulation. That may be part of the solution. But regulation often has the unintended side effect of cementing existing giants’ power. Larger companies can deal with compliance costs and regulatory complexity that overwhelm smaller upstarts, while red tape restrains newcomers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need a level playing field. And in service of that, we need thoughtful regulation that respects this fundamental truth: startups and technologies offer a more effective way to check incumbents’ power. Moreover, knee-jerk regulatory responses ignore what sets the internet apart from other technologies. Many of the usual calls for regulation assume that the internet is similar to past communications networks, like telephone and cable TV networks. But these older, hardware-based networks are different from the internet, a software-based network. The internet depends, of course, on physical infrastructure owned by telecom providers. But it is the code running at the network edges &#8212; on PCs, phones, and servers &#8212; that drives the behavior of internet services. This code can be upgraded. With the right set of features and incentives, new software can propagate across the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to its malleable nature, the internet can be reshaped through innovation and market forces. Software is special because it has a nearly unbounded range of expressiveness. Almost anything you can imagine can be encoded in software; software is the encoding of human thought, just like writing or painting or cave drawings. Computers take those encoded thoughts and run them at lightning speeds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why Steve Jobs once described the computer as “a bicycle for the mind.” It accelerates our abilities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware is so expressive that it is better thought of not as engineering, but as an art form. The plasticity and flexibility of code offer an immensely rich design space, far closer in the breadth of possibilities to creative activities like sculpting and fiction writing than engineering activities like bridge building. As with other art forms, practitioners regularly develop new genres and movements that fundamentally shift what’s possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s what’s happening today. Just as the internet seemed to be consolidating beyond repair, a new software movement emerged that can reimagine the internet. The movement has the potential to bring back the spirit of the early internet; secure property rights for creators; reclaim user ownership and control; and break the stranglehold big, centralized companies have on our lives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere’s a better way, and these are still the early days. The internet can still fulfill the promise of its original vision. Entrepreneurs, technologists, creators, and users can make it happen. The dream of an open network that fosters creativity and entrepreneurship doesn’t have to die.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the beginning, not the end, of internet innovation. There’s an urgency to that conviction, though: the United States is already losing its lead in this new movement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERead Write Own: A new movement \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo understand how we got here, it helps to be familiar with the broad strokes of internet history: The first thing to know is that power on the internet derives from how \u003Cem\u003Enetworks\u003C\u002Fem\u003E are designed. Network design &#8212; the way nodes connect, interact, and form an overarching structure &#8212; might seem like an arcane technical topic, but it is the single most relevant factor in determining how rights and money are distributed across the internet. Even small initial design decisions can have profound downstream consequences on the control and economics of internet services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, network design determines outcomes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil recently, networks came in two competing types:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E&#8220;Protocol networks”, like email and the web, are open systems controlled by communities of software developers and other network stakeholders. These networks are egalitarian, democratic, and permissionless: open to anyone and free to access. In these systems, money and power tend to flow to the network edges, incentivizing systems to grow around them.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E“Corporate networks” are networks that companies, instead of communities, own and control. These are like walled gardens with one groundskeeper; they’re theme parks controlled by a single megacorp. Corporate networks run centralized, permissioned services that allow them to quickly develop advanced features, attract investment, and accrue profits to reinvest in growth. In these systems, money and power flow to the network center, to companies that own the networks, and away from users and developers at the network edges.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI see the history of the internet as unfolding in three acts, each marked by a predominating network architecture:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIn the first act, the “read era” (circa 1990-2005) early internet protocol networks democratized information. Anyone could type a few words into a web browser and read about almost any topic through websites.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIn the second act, the “read-write era” (roughly 2006-2020), corporate networks democratized publishing. Anyone could write and publish to mass audiences through posts on social networks and other services.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENow a new type of architecture is enabling the internet’s third act. This architecture represents a natural synthesis of the two prior types, and it is \u003Cem\u003Edemocratizing ownership. \u003C\u002Fem\u003EIn the dawning “read-write-own era,” anyone can become a network stakeholder &#8212; gaining power and economic upside previously enjoyed by only a small number of corporate affiliates, like stockholders and employees.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new era promises to counteract big company consolidation and return the internet to its dynamic roots.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople can read and write on the internet, but they can also now \u003Cem\u003Eown. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Blockchains” and “blockchain networks” are the technologies driving the movement. This new movement goes by a few names. Some people call it “crypto,” since the foundation of its technology is cryptography. Others call it “web3,” implying that it is leading to a third era of the internet. Whichever name you prefer, the core technology of blockchains presents unique advantages. Blockchain networks are the most credible and civic-minded force to counterbalance internet consolidation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may still be wondering, but so what? What problems do blockchains solve?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome people will tell you that blockchains are a new type of database, one that multiple parties can edit, share, and trust. A better description is that blockchains are a new class of computer, but one you can’t put in your pocket or on your desk, as you might with a smartphone or laptop. They do store information, and run rules encoded in software that can manipulate that information.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the significance of blockchains lies in the unique way that they &#8212; and the networks built on top of them &#8212; are \u003Cem\u003Econtrolled\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith traditional computers, the hardware controls the software. Hardware exists in the physical world, where an individual or organization owns and controls it. That means that, ultimately, a person or group of people is in charge of both the hardware and the software. People can change their minds, and therefore the software they control, at any time. Blockchains invert the hardware-software power relationship, like the internet before them. With blockchains, the software governs a network of hardware devices. The software &#8212; in all its expressive glory &#8212; is in charge.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does this all matter? Because blockchains are computers that can, for the first time ever, establish inviolable rules in software. This allows blockchains to make strong, software-enforced commitments to users. A pivotal commitment involves digital ownership, which places economic and governance power in the hands of users. The ability for blockchains to make strong commitments about how they will behave in the future allows \u003Cem\u003Enew networks \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eto be created.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchain networks therefore solve problems that earlier network architectures can’t solve:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey can connect people in social networks while empowering users over corporate interests.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey can underpin marketplaces and payment networks that facilitate commerce, but with persistently lower take rates.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey can enable new forms of monetizable media, and interoperable and immersive digital worlds.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey allow artificial intelligence products to \u003Cem\u003Ecompensate\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; rather than \u003Cem\u003Ecannibalize\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; creators.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, blockchains create networks, but unlike other network architectures &#8212; and here’s the key point &#8212; they have more desirable outcomes: Blockchain networks combine the societal benefits of protocol networks with the competitive advantages of corporate networks. Software developers get open access, creators get direct relationships with their audiences, fees are guaranteed to stay low, and users get valuable economic and governance rights. At the same time, blockchain networks have the technical and financial capabilities to compete with corporate networks. Blockchains therefore can:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eincentivize innovation\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ereduce taxes on creators\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Elet network contributors share in decision making and upside\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAsking “What problems do blockchains solve?” is like asking “What problems does steel solve over, say, wood?” Blockchain networks are a new construction material for building a better internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe ‘casino vs. the computer’\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENew technologies are often controversial, and blockchains are no exception. Many people associate blockchains with scams and get-rich-quick schemes. There is some truth to these claims, as there was truth to similar claims about tech-driven financial manias of the past &#8212; from the railroad boom of the 1830s to the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. The public discussion mostly focused on IPOs and stock prices, but there were also entrepreneurs and technologists who looked beyond the ups and downs, rolled up their sleeves, and built products and services that eventually delivered on the hype.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were speculators, but there were also builders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, the same cultural divide exists around blockchains:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOne group &#8212; “the casino” &#8212; is often the much louder of the two, and it is primarily interested in trading and speculation. At its worst, this culture of gambling has led to catastrophes like the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX. This group gets most of the media attention, which influences the public image for the entire category.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe other group &#8212; “the computer” &#8212; is the far more serious of the two, and it is motivated by a long-term vision. This group’s practitioners understand that the financial aspects of blockchains are only a means to an end, a way to align incentives toward a larger goal. They realize the real potential in using blockchains is to build better networks, and therefore a better internet. These people are quieter and don’t get as much attention, but they are the ones who will have lasting effects.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn’t to say the computer culture isn’t interested in making money. We’re a venture capital firm. Most of the tech industry is profit-driven. The difference is that real innovation takes time to generate financial returns. That’s why most venture capital funds (ours included) are structured with purposefully long hold periods. Producing valuable new technologies can take up to a decade and sometimes longer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComputer culture is long term. Casino culture is not.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, it’s the computer versus the casino battling it out to define the narrative for this software movement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, optimism and cynicism can both be taken too far. The dot-com bubble, followed by bust, reminded many people of that. The way to see the truth is to separate the essence of a technology from specific uses and misuses of it. A hammer can build a home, or it can demolish one. All technologies have the capacity to help or harm; blockchains are no different. The question is, how can we maximize the good while minimizing the bad?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe decisions we make now will determine the internet’s future: who builds, owns, and uses it; where innovation happens; and what the experience will be for everyone. Blockchains, and the networks they enable, unlock the extraordinary power of software as an art form &#8212; with the internet as its canvas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe movement has an opportunity to change the course of history, to remake humanity’s relationship to the digital, to reimagine what’s possible. Anyone can participate &#8212; whether you’re a developer, creator, entrepreneur, or user. This is a chance to create the internet we want, not the internet we inherited.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Freadwriteown.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ELearn more\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

In a democratic system, this manifests in the form of liberty and the freedom to oppose leaders &#8212; critical tools that can enable decentralized governance to surpass the effectiveness and accomplishments of centralized governance.

The first, already alluded to above, is by removing rent-seeking intermediaries. The logic of blockchains is once you purchase an NFT it is yours to fully control, just like when you buy books or sneakers in the real world. There are and will continue to be NFT platforms and marketplaces, but they will be constrained in what they can charge because blockchain-based ownership shifts the power back to creators and users — you can shop around and force the marketplace to earn its fees. (Note that lowering the intermediary fees can have a multiplier effect on creator disposable income. For example, if you make $100K in revenue and have $80K in costs, cutting out a 50% take rate increases your revenue to $200K, multiplying your disposable income 6x, from $20K to $120K.)\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe second way NFTs change creator economics is by enabling granular price tiering. In ad-based models, revenue is generated more or less uniformly regardless of the fan’s enthusiasm level. As with Substack, NFTs allow the creator to “cream skim” the most passionate users by offering them special items which cost more. But NFTs go farther than non-crypto products in that they are easily sliced and diced into a descending series of pricing tiers. NBA Top Shot cards range from over $100K to a few dollars. Fan of Bitcoin? You can buy as much or little as you want, down to 8 decimal points, depending on your level of enthusiasm. Crypto’s fine-grained granularity lets creators capture a much larger area under the demand curve.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2021\u002F05\u002FScreen-Shot-2021-02-27-at-12.56.46-PM-1536x321-1.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-415 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2021\u002F05\u002FScreen-Shot-2021-02-27-at-12.56.46-PM-1536x321-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"321\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe third and most important way NFTs change creator economics is by making users owners, thereby reducing customer acquisition costs to near zero.

Their utility will increase as digital experiences are built around them, including marketplaces, social networks, showcases, games, and virtual worlds. It’s also likely that other consumer-facing crypto products emerge that pair with NFTs. Modern video games like Fortnite contain sophisticated economies that mix fungible tokens like V-Bucks with NFTs\u002Fvirtual goods like skins.

The first, already alluded to above, is by removing rent-seeking intermediaries. The logic of blockchains is once you purchase an NFT it is yours to fully control, just like when you buy books or sneakers in the real world. There are and will continue to be NFT platforms and marketplaces, but they will be constrained in what they can charge because blockchain-based ownership shifts the power back to creators and users — you can shop around and force the marketplace to earn its fees. (Note that lowering the intermediary fees can have a multiplier effect on creator disposable income. For example, if you make $100K in revenue and have $80K in costs, cutting out a 50% take rate increases your revenue to $200K, multiplying your disposable income 6x, from $20K to $120K.)\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe second way NFTs change creator economics is by enabling granular price tiering. In ad-based models, revenue is generated more or less uniformly regardless of the fan’s enthusiasm level. As with Substack, NFTs allow the creator to “cream skim” the most passionate users by offering them special items which cost more. But NFTs go farther than non-crypto products in that they are easily sliced and diced into a descending series of pricing tiers. NBA Top Shot cards range from over $100K to a few dollars. Fan of Bitcoin? You can buy as much or little as you want, down to 8 decimal points, depending on your level of enthusiasm. Crypto’s fine-grained granularity lets creators capture a much larger area under the demand curve.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2021\u002F05\u002FScreen-Shot-2021-02-27-at-12.56.46-PM-1536x321-1.png\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-415 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2021\u002F05\u002FScreen-Shot-2021-02-27-at-12.56.46-PM-1536x321-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"321\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe third and most important way NFTs change creator economics is by making users owners, thereby reducing customer acquisition costs to near zero.

Habitat looked and felt different: a universe which grew to over 20000 regions, including player homes, shops, arenas, theaters, newspapers, houses of workshop, and a “wilderness” area where crimes like theft and murder could be committed (a practice which a Greek Orthodox priest, who led one of \u003Cem\u003EHabitat’s\u003C\u002Fem\u003E aforementioned houses of worship, preached vehemently against in his digital “Order of the Holy Walnut” church).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were stories of in-game currency arbitrage related to a bug that allowed a few enterprising players to buy underpriced game items from an ATM, and sell them at a higher price in a shop across town &#8212; resulting in the printing of hundreds of thousands of in-game tokens overnight.

Even the internet standards \u003Cem\u003EHabitat\u003C\u002Fem\u003E was built upon would cease to exist within a few years: OSI, whose “presentation” and “application” layers Morningstar and Farmer complained were “simply the wrong abstractions for the higher levels of a cyberspace communications protocol”, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fspectrum.ieee.org\u002Fosi-the-internet-that-wasnt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ewas beat out a few years later\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by the simpler TCP\u002FIP internet standard upon which the net lives today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese early tensions might be best summed up by the header of the Morningstar and Farmer reflection on the Habitat experiment: “\u003Cstrong\u003EDetailed central planning is impossible; don&#8217;t even try.” \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EIndeed, one takeaway from \u003Cem\u003EHabitat\u003C\u002Fem\u003E that we can apply to the internet today is that top-down attempts to impose order are almost always undermined by acts of subversion, or the natural phenomenon of the free market prevailing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI first learned about Habitat in \u003Cem\u003EVirtual Society\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.penguinrandomhouse.com\u002Fbooks\u002F675690\u002Fvirtual-society-by-herman-narula\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ean upcoming book\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on the metaverse by Herman Narula, the co-founder and CEO of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.improbable.io\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EImprobable\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a company that has been in the business of building infrastructure for games, digital experiences, and now the metaverse for the past decade. Narula’s main argument about the metaverse is one that Morningstar and Farmer would likely agree with: The metaverse, regardless of who builds it, how users access it, or the underlying infrastructure that supports it, should be designed to facilitate robust forms of user interaction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as importantly (though not addressed by Morningstar and Farmer), is the idea that items and experiences across the different virtual worlds that grow to exist should be able to interoperate with one another. In Narula’s words:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“A metaverse is a collection of realities which include the real world or a &#8216;home reality&#8217; and a series of other worlds that a society imbues with meaning. Events, objects, and identities can exist in and be modified by multiple worlds in the metaverse. The utility of a metaverse lies in its ability to facilitate meaningful fulfilling experiences in its constituent worlds.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany arguments about the metaverse have hinged on what it looks like: Should it be 2D or 3D? Should it be accessed immersively in VR and AR, or is desktop and mobile an appropriate platform?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe focus on aesthetics is actually a debate about standards. “What should it look like” is shorthand for “what should developers expect?” How do you reconcile between JSON and XML data types? If you’re designing for 3D, what’s the minimum number of polygons your asset should be composed of? Should avatars be available as glTF, USD, VRM, or some other file format? Should an experience happening on a Unity client be able to interoperate with a game on an Unreal Engine client? What happens when you introduce NFTs into the mix (or if you’re Microsoft, what happens when you \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.minecraft.net\u002Fen-us\u002Farticle\u002Fminecraft-and-nfts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emake a unilateral decision to ban them\u003C\u002Fa\u003E completely from Minecraft with seemingly no warning)?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think these questions are tremendously valuable, in that they signal an attitude of openness toward interoperability that’s crucial for any future version of the metaverse. But it also seems like the aesthetic and technical considerations are conflated, perhaps at the expense of economic or political considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the words of Narula, “These other worlds aren’t alternative realities into which we choose to escape: They are more reality.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you facilitate “more reality”?

As Narula puts it: “The mirror world helps catalyze conservationists’ efforts in the real world.” What Narula argues in the first few chapters of \u003Cem\u003EVirtual Society \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eis that early metaverses had a sense of reciprocity between the “imagined” world and the real one. If you extend that notion to the present day, then we should have a similar ideal: whatever form the metaverse takes, there should be a sense of permeability between the virtual world and our physical one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen something happens in the metaverse, you should feel its resonance in the physical world, and vice-versa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENarula spends a lot of time in \u003Cem\u003EVirtual Society\u003C\u002Fem\u003E explaining how he defines meaningful interaction in the metaverse, and the technological innovations achieved by Improbable to enable it for users. For Narula, meaning might be measured in “ops per second”:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;how many separate and simultaneous things can happen in a virtual environment, by reflecting how many messages are being sent or need to be sent simultaneously to model that environment. As an example, at time of writing, a game of Fortnite which allows 100 players to interact together requires roughly 10,000 communications operations per second. This statistic means that the server needs to process all of these messages, and also to quickly send them to the machines of each connected user that needs them.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis past summer, I attended a demo event in Improbable’s M² network, which the team intends to be a network of metaverses where users can connect in highly dense environments, and port in NFTs and other avatars between worlds. There were over 4500 users in attendance, all in the same server instance (in other words, no sharding!), speaking and interacting with one another. Over time, M² intends to grow to support not just the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fotherside.xyz\u002Flitepaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EOtherside metaverse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, but other creative endeavors as well: concerts with musicians, spaces for communities, events with artists and creators.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn many ways, the challenges M² aims to address &#8212; how to get a bunch of disparate users to agree on a shared notion of temporality &#8212; is also a core challenge that blockchains solve for. And in many ways, we’re also beginning to see blockchains, and the applications built on top of them, begin to solve other problems that have frustrated the internet and early attempts at the metaverse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne way to think of a blockchain is as a game-like social network with an infinitely customizable frontend. Using Ethereum as an example: You have a public key as a form of login; opt-in identities tied to that public key (e.g. ENS, Farcaster); an inventory (NFTs, ERC20 tokens); applications accessible through your public key (e.g. Uniswap, NFT exchanges, on-chain games); and a shared notion of history (viewable on Etherscan or parseable on an Ethereum node).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart contracts running on Ethereum are open-source &#8212; meaning that users can audit them for safety, and just as importantly, modify them via forking. These modifications may extend the underlying codebase (e.g., a composable application that interacts with the smart contract, a new client or frontend built for the smart contract, or a derivative project based on the initial protocol). The more a smart contract is interacted with and extended, the more valuable it can become.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of the most interesting experiments in Ethereum today have been in fields that mix artistic, social, economic, political, and gameplay-like elements. A good example here is \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnouns.wtf\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ENounsDAO\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which launched in the summer of last year. In brief, NounsDAO is an NFT project in which a daily auction is held for the sale of a Noun NFT, and proceeds of the sale go to a treasury shared by holders of the Nouns, who can \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnouns.wtf\u002Fvote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Evote on proposals\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for how the treasury is spent. Crucially, the auction protocol, the art, and the governance is all conducted entirely on-chain.

The effort to develop alternative clients for NounsDAO is a testament to the notion that a protocol should be resilient, and offer users a breadth of choices for how they access it.

It feels like an effort to rebuild digital society as if the social ruptures and micro-cultures manifested by the internet never happened (a pretty futile act in my opinion). One thing Narula hints at &#8212; that I don’t see a lot of people talking about &#8212; is that those most inclined to build on metaverse platforms (be it Ethereum, other blockchains, or platforms that prioritize interoperable experiences) will likely be internet-native communities and creators, with treasuries that they want to preserve for developing their own culture.

Narula’s main argument about the metaverse is one that Morningstar and Farmer would likely agree with: The metaverse, regardless of who builds it, how users access it, or the underlying infrastructure that supports it, should be designed to facilitate robust forms of user interaction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as importantly (though not addressed by Morningstar and Farmer), is the idea that items and experiences across the different virtual worlds that grow to exist should be able to interoperate with one another. In Narula’s words:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“A metaverse is a collection of realities which include the real world or a &#8216;home reality&#8217; and a series of other worlds that a society imbues with meaning. Events, objects, and identities can exist in and be modified by multiple worlds in the metaverse. The utility of a metaverse lies in its ability to facilitate meaningful fulfilling experiences in its constituent worlds.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany arguments about the metaverse have hinged on what it looks like: Should it be 2D or 3D? Should it be accessed immersively in VR and AR, or is desktop and mobile an appropriate platform?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe focus on aesthetics is actually a debate about standards. “What should it look like” is shorthand for “what should developers expect?” How do you reconcile between JSON and XML data types? If you’re designing for 3D, what’s the minimum number of polygons your asset should be composed of? Should avatars be available as glTF, USD, VRM, or some other file format? Should an experience happening on a Unity client be able to interoperate with a game on an Unreal Engine client? What happens when you introduce NFTs into the mix (or if you’re Microsoft, what happens when you \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.minecraft.net\u002Fen-us\u002Farticle\u002Fminecraft-and-nfts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emake a unilateral decision to ban them\u003C\u002Fa\u003E completely from Minecraft with seemingly no warning)?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think these questions are tremendously valuable, in that they signal an attitude of openness toward interoperability that’s crucial for any future version of the metaverse.

If you extend that notion to the present day, then we should have a similar ideal: whatever form the metaverse takes, there should be a sense of permeability between the virtual world and our physical one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen something happens in the metaverse, you should feel its resonance in the physical world, and vice-versa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENarula spends a lot of time in \u003Cem\u003EVirtual Society\u003C\u002Fem\u003E explaining how he defines meaningful interaction in the metaverse, and the technological innovations achieved by Improbable to enable it for users. For Narula, meaning might be measured in “ops per second”:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;how many separate and simultaneous things can happen in a virtual environment, by reflecting how many messages are being sent or need to be sent simultaneously to model that environment. As an example, at time of writing, a game of Fortnite which allows 100 players to interact together requires roughly 10,000 communications operations per second. This statistic means that the server needs to process all of these messages, and also to quickly send them to the machines of each connected user that needs them.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis past summer, I attended a demo event in Improbable’s M² network, which the team intends to be a network of metaverses where users can connect in highly dense environments, and port in NFTs and other avatars between worlds. There were over 4500 users in attendance, all in the same server instance (in other words, no sharding!), speaking and interacting with one another. Over time, M² intends to grow to support not just the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fotherside.xyz\u002Flitepaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EOtherside metaverse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, but other creative endeavors as well: concerts with musicians, spaces for communities, events with artists and creators.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn many ways, the challenges M² aims to address &#8212; how to get a bunch of disparate users to agree on a shared notion of temporality &#8212; is also a core challenge that blockchains solve for. And in many ways, we’re also beginning to see blockchains, and the applications built on top of them, begin to solve other problems that have frustrated the internet and early attempts at the metaverse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne way to think of a blockchain is as a game-like social network with an infinitely customizable frontend. Using Ethereum as an example: You have a public key as a form of login; opt-in identities tied to that public key (e.g. ENS, Farcaster); an inventory (NFTs, ERC20 tokens); applications accessible through your public key (e.g. Uniswap, NFT exchanges, on-chain games); and a shared notion of history (viewable on Etherscan or parseable on an Ethereum node).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart contracts running on Ethereum are open-source &#8212; meaning that users can audit them for safety, and just as importantly, modify them via forking. These modifications may extend the underlying codebase (e.g., a composable application that interacts with the smart contract, a new client or frontend built for the smart contract, or a derivative project based on the initial protocol). The more a smart contract is interacted with and extended, the more valuable it can become.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of the most interesting experiments in Ethereum today have been in fields that mix artistic, social, economic, political, and gameplay-like elements. A good example here is \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnouns.wtf\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ENounsDAO\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which launched in the summer of last year. In brief, NounsDAO is an NFT project in which a daily auction is held for the sale of a Noun NFT, and proceeds of the sale go to a treasury shared by holders of the Nouns, who can \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fnouns.wtf\u002Fvote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Evote on proposals\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for how the treasury is spent.

The effort to develop alternative clients for NounsDAO is a testament to the notion that a protocol should be resilient, and offer users a breadth of choices for how they access it. The success of the NFT project itself is just one example of the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fcc0-nft-creative-commons-zero-license-rights\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eprevalence of cc0 NFT collections\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in general &#8212; that an image in the metaverse should be freely forked, mutated, and be enjoyed by anyone who desires to use it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the project, cryptonetworks, and the metaverse itself are still in early forms, I think NounsDAO represents a compelling example of what elements of the metaverse one day might look like: a robust ecosystem around a core ethos or culture, that persists across both the digital and physical worlds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA big irony I’ve noticed in the corporate-motivated efforts behind the metaverse is that these teams are often building for massive brands that predated the internet.

One thing Narula hints at &#8212; that I don’t see a lot of people talking about &#8212; is that those most inclined to build on metaverse platforms (be it Ethereum, other blockchains, or platforms that prioritize interoperable experiences) will likely be internet-native communities and creators, with treasuries that they want to preserve for developing their own culture.

That vision lost some clarity over the past two decades as governments cracked down on misuse. And yet, despite this, much of the technology underlying the internet – communications protocols such as HTTP (data exchange for websites), SMTP (email), and FTP (file transfers) – remained as free and open as ever. \u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EGovernments around the world preserved the internet’s promise by accepting that the technology depends upon open-source, decentralized, autonomous, and standardized protocols. When the U.S. passed the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992, it paved the way for a commercial internet boom without tampering with TCP\u002FIP, the protocol for computer networking. When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it didn’t interfere with the way data traverses networks, yet still provided enough clarity to enable the U.S. to dominate the internet economy with now-giants such as Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and others. While no legislation is perfect, these guardrails allowed industry and innovation to grow, resulting in many of the internet services we enjoy today.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOne of the major enabling factors: Instead of regulating protocols, governments sought to regulate the apps – applications like browsers, websites, and other user-facing software, commonly referred to as “clients” – through which users access the web. This same guideline which still governs the web should extend to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fwhy-web3-matters\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eweb3\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, an evolution of the internet that will feature new apps or clients, such as webapps and wallets, and advanced decentralized protocols, including a settlement layer for value exchange, enabled by blockchains and smart contracts.

This is how the U.S. can compel YouTube to take down a terrorist recruitment video, while leaving DASH (a video streaming protocol) alone. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThere are a few reasons why protocol-level regulation is undesirable and, moreover, unworkable. First, it’s not technologically possible for protocols to comply with regulations, which often require indefinable, subjective determinations. Second, it’s impractical for protocols to incorporate global regulations, which vary – and may clash – by jurisdiction. And third, it’s unnecessary and counterproductive to rewrite the web’s technical underpinnings given that apps or clients can comply with regulations further up the tech stack.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ELet’s review each reason in more detail.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Protocols cannot technically comply with subjective regulations\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ERegardless of how well-intentioned a regulation may be, if it requires subjective assessments, its application to protocols will be disastrous.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EConsider spam. Hatred for spam email is nearly universal, but what would the web of today look like if authorities made it illegal for the email protocol (SMTP) to facilitate the sending of spam? The answer: not good. What constitutes junk email is inherently subjective and changes over time. Massive companies like Google spend fortunes trying to eliminate spam from their email apps or clients (e.g., Gmail) – and they still get it wrong. In addition, even if some authority mandated that SMTP filter spam by default, malicious actors could, because protocols are open source, simply reverse engineer the filter in order to circumvent it. As a result, prohibiting SMTP from facilitating the sending of spam would either be ineffective or the end of email as we know it.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIn web3, we can analogize tokens to email in the context of a decentralized exchange protocol (DEX). If governments wish to prohibit the exchange of certain tokens they believe may be securities or derivatives using such a protocol, they need to be able to articulate technical specifications that objectively meet such classification. But such objective classification criteria are not possible. The determination of whether an asset is a security or derivative is subjective and requires an analysis of facts and laws. Even the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fsec-crypto-custody-rule\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Estruggles\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2022\u002F04\u002F18\u002Fsec-exchange-act-proposal-comment-a16z-crypto\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ewith this\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAttempting to embed second-order, subjective analyses into base layer instruction sets is an exercise in futility.

SMTP enables us to send email to anyone in the world, but if the U.S. required SMTP to filter spam email, we can assume that foreign governments would require similar restrictions. Further, because what constitutes spam is subjective, we can also assume that governments’ requirements would differ. So, even if it were technologically possible to build protocols capable of making complex and subjective decisions, doing so is antithetical to the concept of establishing a standard that is practical on a global scale. It’s simply not possible for SMTP to incorporate the changing spam filter requirements of 195 countries, and even if the protocol could, it wouldn’t know what country users are in and how to prioritize competing determinations with any fairness. Adding subjectivity to protocols destroys one of the pillars that makes them useful: standardization.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ERules are context dependent. In web3, what’s permissible under securities and derivatives laws varies by country, and those laws change all the time. A DEX has no way of establishing a global standard for such laws and, like SMTP, has no way to curtail access based on geography. Ultimately, there’s no way for protocols to be successful if they are required to be built on top of the shifting sands of global regulation.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cb\u003E[toc-embed]Avoid these problems by making apps or clients comply\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBy now it should be obvious why it’s critical to regulate apps instead of protocols. App-level regulation can accomplish the goals of governments without jeopardizing the underlying technology. We know this because the approach already works.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EEarly web protocols remain useful after more than 30 years because they continue to be open source, decentralized, autonomous, and standardized. But governments can restrict the information passing through these protocols by regulating apps. Or they can protect the free flow of information, as the U.S. did by approving Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Each country can determine its own approach and the businesses that operate browsers, websites, and applications in their respective jurisdictions are capable of tailoring products to comply with such decisions.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAs the dichotomy between protocols and apps is the same in web3, the regulatory approach to web3 should stay the same. Web3 apps like wallets, webapps, and other applications enable users to deposit digital assets in liquidity pools of lending protocols, to buy NFTs through marketplace protocols, and to trade assets on DEXs. Those wallets, websites, and applications can be regulated in every jurisdiction where they seek to provide access, and it’s reasonable to require them to comply.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe first generation of the web gave us incredible tools in the form of networking, data exchange, email, and file transfer protocols, all of which made it possible to move information at the speed of the internet.

Hatred for spam email is nearly universal, but what would the web of today look like if authorities made it illegal for the email protocol (SMTP) to facilitate the sending of spam? The answer: not good. What constitutes junk email is inherently subjective and changes over time. Massive companies like Google spend fortunes trying to eliminate spam from their email apps or clients (e.g., Gmail) – and they still get it wrong. In addition, even if some authority mandated that SMTP filter spam by default, malicious actors could, because protocols are open source, simply reverse engineer the filter in order to circumvent it. As a result, prohibiting SMTP from facilitating the sending of spam would either be ineffective or the end of email as we know it.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIn web3, we can analogize tokens to email in the context of a decentralized exchange protocol (DEX). If governments wish to prohibit the exchange of certain tokens they believe may be securities or derivatives using such a protocol, they need to be able to articulate technical specifications that objectively meet such classification. But such objective classification criteria are not possible. The determination of whether an asset is a security or derivative is subjective and requires an analysis of facts and laws.

So, even if it were technologically possible to build protocols capable of making complex and subjective decisions, doing so is antithetical to the concept of establishing a standard that is practical on a global scale. It’s simply not possible for SMTP to incorporate the changing spam filter requirements of 195 countries, and even if the protocol could, it wouldn’t know what country users are in and how to prioritize competing determinations with any fairness.

Building on the examples already mentioned above: While developers can, in principle, create adventure games around whatever themes and item concepts they want, the fact that many are choosing to develop around Loot bags reflects the community cohesion within the Lootverse. Meanwhile, Blitmap derivative project Flipmap \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fflipmap.art\u002Ffaq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eshared\u003C\u002Fa\u003E part of their revenue with the original Blitmap artists in recognition of that project&#8217;s core position within the community – a move that can promote a healthy culture within a cc0 project ecosystem.

Moreover, while cc0 has some superficial similarity to the strategy of allowing NFT owners specifically to commercialize the intellectual property associated with the NFTs they hold – à la \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fboredapeyachtclub.com\u002F#\u002Fterms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBored Ape Yacht Club\u003C\u002Fa\u003E – there is a crucial difference: cc0 holders don’t have the right to exclude others from using the same IP. This can make it harder for holders to build commercial brands on top of the cc0 asset themselves or grant specific rights to partners – although holders can, of course, still introduce expanded intellectual property (such as backstories or derivatives) that they do completely control.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E*  *  *\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization and open development are core elements of blockchain technologies and the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fweb3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebroader crypto ethos\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

As the NFT space continues to evolve and mature, we expect to see more organized infrastructure and design patterns supporting these efforts. There’s also likely to be innovation around frameworks for value capture, just as there has been with open source software.

And as creators continue to advance the space, we expect to see them develop, and experiment with, novel rights and licensing models far beyond what’s in use today.

If, for example, UrbanOutfitters wanted to put my design on a tee, instead of hiring someone on their team to design something that looks like it, they can just use the actual work.&#8221; Sometimes, adopting cc0 can effectively turn competition into cooperation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, cc0 projects can benefit significantly from community agreement about core assets’ value and contribution. Community cohesion and engagement is essential here. Building on the examples already mentioned above: While developers can, in principle, create adventure games around whatever themes and item concepts they want, the fact that many are choosing to develop around Loot bags reflects the community cohesion within the Lootverse. Meanwhile, Blitmap derivative project Flipmap \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fflipmap.art\u002Ffaq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eshared\u003C\u002Fa\u003E part of their revenue with the original Blitmap artists in recognition of that project&#8217;s core position within the community – a move that can promote a healthy culture within a cc0 project ecosystem.

Moreover, while cc0 has some superficial similarity to the strategy of allowing NFT owners specifically to commercialize the intellectual property associated with the NFTs they hold – à la \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fboredapeyachtclub.com\u002F#\u002Fterms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBored Ape Yacht Club\u003C\u002Fa\u003E – there is a crucial difference: cc0 holders don’t have the right to exclude others from using the same IP. This can make it harder for holders to build commercial brands on top of the cc0 asset themselves or grant specific rights to partners – although holders can, of course, still introduce expanded intellectual property (such as backstories or derivatives) that they do completely control.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E*  *  *\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization and open development are core elements of blockchain technologies and the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.com\u002Fweb3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebroader crypto ethos\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

Some cc0 project leaders, like the creators of Chain Runners, have continued building atop the initial cc0 assets themselves, actively establishing an \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.chainrunners.xyz\u002Fthe-universe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eenvironment\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that derivative projects can plug into and build on top of.

As the NFT space continues to evolve and mature, we expect to see more organized infrastructure and design patterns supporting these efforts. There’s also likely to be innovation around frameworks for value capture, just as there has been with open source software.

And as creators continue to advance the space, we expect to see them develop, and experiment with, novel rights and licensing models far beyond what’s in use today.

Apple doesn’t rely on its shareholders to vote on the technical framework for the next generation iPhone. Amazon doesn’t openly solicit shareholder feedback for each step of its fulfillment center growth plans.

As James Madison wrote in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Favalon.law.yale.edu\u002F18th_century\u002Ffed14.asp\"\u003E\u003Ci\u003EFederalist No. 14\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, “In a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents.

Examples include explicitly defining the roles of internal units, requiring certain expertise from representatives making decisions regarding those units, and ultimately leaving strategic capital allocation decisions to all voters as a check on the organization itself. In turn, these changes can foster political scalability, or the ability for groups to effectively organize in a representative manner even when they grow exponentially, without sacrificing organizational decisiveness, agility, or inclusion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E[toc-embed]Balancing competing interests\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDelegation is but a first step among many.

This is thought to have two benefits. First, to recruit workers who may lack the interest or “charisma” to be elected politicians but who have crucial skills and knowledge; and second, to create at least one degree of separation between these employees’ work and the intense and sometimes myopic pressures of the electorate.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECorporate governance works similarly. The directors of the board are, loosely, akin to elected delegates of the shareholders at large. They in turn oversee the executives who run the company.

Apple doesn’t rely on its shareholders to vote on the technical framework for the next generation iPhone. Amazon doesn’t openly solicit shareholder feedback for each step of its fulfillment center growth plans.

As James Madison wrote in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Favalon.law.yale.edu\u002F18th_century\u002Ffed14.asp\"\u003E\u003Ci\u003EFederalist No. 14\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, “In a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents.

The primary impediment is no longer physical travel, but system complexity. We expect to see more sophisticated and widespread forms of representation within web3 governance continue to develop as an antidote to rising complexity. From a first principles perspective, web3 communities need to decide on the \u003Cb\u003Epolitical system design\u003C\u002Fb\u003E and \u003Cb\u003Esocial contract\u003C\u002Fb\u003E between actors in the ecosystem before applying the specific tools to implement them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile web3 governance \u003Ci\u003Eshould\u003C\u002Fi\u003E be different from older archetypes, it can also incorporate well-designed representative elements from traditional frameworks to build more inclusive and efficient organizations. Examples include explicitly defining the roles of internal units, requiring certain expertise from representatives making decisions regarding those units, and ultimately leaving strategic capital allocation decisions to all voters as a check on the organization itself. In turn, these changes can foster political scalability, or the ability for groups to effectively organize in a representative manner even when they grow exponentially, without sacrificing organizational decisiveness, agility, or inclusion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E[toc-embed]Balancing competing interests\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDelegation is but a first step among many.

And when representatives do a better job, stakeholders believe in the system and are more willing to put the time and effort in to pay attention—further enhancing the incentives for representatives to do a good job. In this way, if successful, the system becomes self-reinforcing: good governance begets more good governance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe call this the \u003Cb\u003Eaccountability flywheel. \u003C\u002Fb\u003EAnd web3 has a powerful tool to facilitate it—the token.

It&#8217;s hard to picture this now, but the internet was a thing that people used only intermittently, to check email or plan travel or do some research. The average internet user spent about 30 minutes a day online, compared to about 7 hours today. To use the internet, you had to sit down in front of a desktop PC and &#8220;log on&#8221; (most people still had dial-up), nothing like the always-on, high-speed mobile internet we use today. In 2001, Amazon&#8217;s stock price hit an \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcompaniesmarketcap.com\u002Famazon\u002Fmarketcap\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eall-time\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.zdnet.com\u002Farticle\u002Famazon-cash-to-run-dry-by-2001\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Elow\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, with a market cap of $2.2B, about 1\u002F500th of what it is today. A prominent research firm \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pewresearch.org\u002Finternet\u002F2003\u002F05\u002F18\u002Fbroadband-adoption-at-home\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Epublished\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a study asking Americans if they&#8217;d adopt broadband and the majority said no. Email was the most popular internet use case and they didn’t see the need to make it faster. The National Academy of Sciences \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.greatachievements.org\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eranked\u003C\u002Fa\u003E the internet 13th in its list of great inventions over the last 100 years, beneath radio and telephones. The mainstream consensus was that the internet was a cool invention, but had limited use cases, and probably wasn&#8217;t a good place to build a business.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, there was a small but growing movement of developers and founders who were excited about the idea that the internet could be more than a read-only medium – that it could allow anyone to create and publish, to not only read but also write, as we said back then. This movement became known as web 2. The runner up name was read-write web. (These are not after-the-fact terms: there were \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.oreilly.com\u002Fpub\u002Fa\u002Fweb2\u002Farchive\u002Fwhat-is-web-20.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eprominent\u003C\u002Fa\u003E publications and conferences that used them.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key web 2 concepts were: letting users publish whatever they want (“user generated content” was a buzzword), social graphs, APIs and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Favc.com\u002F2006\u002F08\u002Fbusiness_develo\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Emashups\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (what we&#8217;d call \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcdixon\u002Fstatus\u002F1451703067213066244?s=20&amp;t=OMwnAHagQ1wsTRv-Bre-wA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Ecomposability\u003C\u002Fa\u003E today), defaulting profiles and photos to public vs private, and tagging over hierarchical navigation, among other things. There were also technical innovations. A seemingly simple but important one was web pages that updated dynamically without reloading the page, what was usually called \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAjax_(programming)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EAjax\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and is now just the way people expect web apps to work. There were mobile devices that could access the open web but they were extremely niche (I was an avid \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=rMNDqO2HjEU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ESidekick\u003C\u002Fa\u003E user).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne striking thing about that period was the contrast between what smart founders and engineers talked about at dinner and on weekends and what the mainstream tech world took seriously during work days. For example, one popular mainstream trend was enterprise security appliances, which were basically servers preloaded with security software. Many of the very same people would go to work and talk about the “serious” products, and then go to dinner, or hang out on the weekends, and talk about consumer internet products and web 2. It was the most interesting thing happening in tech. But generally, the view was, web 2 products were toys that couldn&#8217;t be real businesses. They were hobbies, and not something you would take seriously during the workday.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne lesson for me, which took me some time to learn, and that eventually led to some blog posts I wrote, including “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2010\u002F01\u002F03\u002Fthe-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EThe next thing big thing will start out looking like a toy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” and “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2013\u002F03\u002F02\u002Fwhat-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EWhat the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years\u003C\u002Fa\u003E,” is that there&#8217;s a strong correlation between rich product design spaces and what smart people find interesting. Web 2 was captivating, and led to so many dinner and weekend conversations, because there were so many novel product design possibilities. What if you took this feature and that feature and combined them? What if you applied this design pattern to a different context? What original product concepts would be invented next? This is what got people so excited. In contrast, the “serious stuff,” security appliances and such, seemed much more limited in their possibilities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother striking thing about that period was how small and passionate the web 2 community was. I remember in 2004 going to what I think might have been the first New York Tech meetup. The whole group fit in a small room in Meetup’s headquarters. People demoed software they had created and talked late into the evening. I still have friends from that period. Sometimes I get asked how I first met old friends like Fred Wilson and Alexis Ohanian. The simple answer is there just weren&#8217;t that many people, especially on the east coast, who were interested in these topics. We all knew each other. It was a real community. I have one old friend Alex Rampell (who now works with me at a16z) who I met in 2003 because a friend of mine was at a dinner party and afterwards said “Hey, I met someone else who&#8217;s interested in consumer internet.” It was that rare. But people were very focused and excited. The feeling was that a revolution was brewing. We knew a secret and the rest of the world hadn&#8217;t figured it out yet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for me, I was working on my own web 2 startup called SiteAdvisor. Around 2003, when my co-founders and I started developing the concept, web security threats were spiraling out of control. Most people used PCs with Internet Explorer, and problems like phishing and spyware were widespread. The idea for SiteAdvisor was that we’d start off with a tool that would warn users about security threats like phishing and spyware, and then, over time, applying web 2 concepts like user-generated reviews, layer on more subjective judgements (similar to what \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.trustpilot.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ETrustPilot\u003C\u002Fa\u003E seems to do today). This staged approach was common at the time, a strategy I later characterized as “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2015\u002F01\u002F31\u002Fcome-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ECome for the tool, stay for the network\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.” We built APIs and encouraged mashups and did most of our marketing through SEO.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E2005 was a big year for web 2 because of two acquisitions, Flickr and Delicious, both by Yahoo. The dollar values were small by today’s standards, something like $30M each, but it was an important signal. The assumption up until then was that web 2 was a fun hobby, a way to build cool stuff, but not something that would produce real businesses. Yahoo was considered a savvy company, and said they were making web 2 a core part of their strategy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I recall, that was the point when web 2 started transitioning from a niche cult movement into mainstream tech. Some of the early web 2 founders successfully made the transition. In other cases new entrepreneurs came along who built on the work of the early enthusiasts. The basis of competition switched from creative idea generation to disciplined execution. You had to decide whether you wanted to be the idealistic band at the indy bar or be pragmatic — potentially making compromises — and play in stadiums.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy 2007, things were looking up for web 2. Among other things, Facebook passed 10M users, Twitter was growing and had just gotten VC funded, and Google acquired YouTube. Then the 2008 financial crisis hit, which was a gut check for entrepreneurs. Tech funding dried up, and a lot of smart people said we were on the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Farticles.sequoiacap.com\u002Frip-good-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Everge\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of another great depression.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe financial downturn was a difficult time for many people. But from a startup perspective, the 2008-11 era turned out to be a golden age. Apple released the iPhone app store in 2008 and by 2009 talented founders were pouring in. The mobile app revolution was in full swing. Almost all of today’s top mobile apps were created by companies founded between 2009 and 2011, including Uber, Venmo, Snap, and Instagram. In retrospect, there was a convergence of three powerful trends: social media (by then that word was replacing web 2), cloud computing (which would enable the apps to scale server side), and the rise of smartphones. Independent product design spaces are multiplicative: even if social, cloud, and mobile each improved linearly, the combination could improve exponentially.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI made the chart below to summarize how I&#8217;ve come to think about product and financial cycles. The key idea is that product and financial cycles evolve mostly independently. The top of the chart shows the Nasdaq index as a rough proxy for financial sentiment. Financial sentiment fluctuates unpredictably and sometimes wildly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next row shows the years that iconic startups or products were created. The timing is mostly dictated by product cycles, which are shown in the bottom row. Product cycles follow their own internal logic and tend to be more predictable than financial cycles.

The growth phase arrives when the right mix of technology, talent, and community knowledge comes together to enable the products to go mainstream.

It is also, thanks to him, one of the clearest and most comprehensive discussions of blockspace and why it matters. With that, let’s jump in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EM‍ario Gabriele: OK, Chris, maybe we can start with the basics. What is blockspace?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChris Dixon: Blockspace is space on a blockchain where you can run code and store data. Blockspace is different from traditional compute-space in that, until the advent of blockchains, software was always subordinate to hardware – and then, ultimately, to the owner of that hardware. If you write software for traditional computers, it’s the hardware owners who are in control. If Facebook writes some code and says any developer can come along and have access to a certain API, Facebook management can just change its mind and revoke access later. Because Facebook controls the hardware that the software runs on, it ultimately controls the software.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains are different in the way they&#8217;re architected: the software is in charge of the hardware. If you write software for \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F27\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eblockchains, you can write code that makes strong commitments\u003C\u002Fa\u003E; you can assure users and developers that the software will continue to run as designed. Specifically, blockchains use what&#8217;s called a consensus mechanism to make these commitments. The various hardware operators that run the network come together every so often and vote on the state of the blockchain virtual computer. There&#8217;s game theory around it that guarantees – that makes assurances under most conditions – that the software will continue to run as designed and that the integrity of the data will be maintained.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we&#8217;re seeing now is a wave of entrepreneurs and developers who are building new classes of applications that take advantage of this new computing property: that you can write code that makes strong commitments about how it’s going to behave in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat’s an interesting articulation. I haven’t seen this topic framed around the relationship between software and hardware before, but I think what we’re really talking about here is the matter of control, right?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EExactly. Let&#8217;s hypothetically say that Google introduces GoogleCoin. Google claims there will only ever be 21 million coins. But the software that powers GoogleCoin runs on servers Google controls. Because Google controls its computers, they can just change the 21 million limit to whatever they want. The software is controlled by hardware, and the hardware is controlled by Google management.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EContrast this scenario with how Bitcoin works. Bitcoin promises that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins; that scarcity is one of the factors that enables Bitcoin to have value. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F11\u002F12\u002Fthe-end-of-centralization-and-the-future-of-trust\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EYou can trust\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that Bitcoin will only ever have 21 million bitcoins because this rule is written in the Bitcoin blockchain – it&#8217;s baked into its very architecture. Even if a whole lot of the people running the Bitcoin code – the so-called Bitcoin miners – are trying to subvert those rules, it&#8217;s very, very difficult for them to do so. In the history of Bitcoin and Ethereum and other major blockchains, no one has been able to subvert those game-theoretic guarantees.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s what makes blockspace different. Developers and entrepreneurs who want to build on top of the blockchain ecosystem know what the rules are. They won’t get changed on them the way they get changed by traditional tech companies. When it comes to blockchains, instead of “don&#8217;t be evil,” it&#8217;s “can&#8217;t be evil.” The rules of the system are baked into the code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, blockspace is a unit of compute and storage that lives on blockchains and, as a result, is free from the control of hardware owners. We’ve seen many different expressions of blockspace and its surrounding mechanisms beneath that foundational definition. What do you think are the most important design considerations?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockspace exists on blockchains, and blockchains can be designed in various ways. The most important characteristic of a blockchain is its security properties. How reliable are the commitments it makes? Can you trust them? Can you trust the system can’t be subverted or hacked? That’s the most important feature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother important feature is performance. This is related to the fees you pay when you transact on a blockchain. If you can make systems that are more performant, you can lower those fees. On a blockchain like Solana, for example, one of the nice features is the fees are low because of the way it&#8217;s designed. Now, some people would argue that you make trade-offs on the security side to get that performance. But clearly, security and performance are both top priorities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother consideration is the community around the blockchain. Some blockchains are home to communities focused on software development, building new applications, and creating valuable new internet services. Ethereum comes to mind as an example of a healthy developer community. Other blockchains focus more on speculation and gambling and, I would argue, are less healthy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo blockchains are, on the one hand, computers, so their security and performance properties matter; but they&#8217;re also social networks, and they need to have healthy communities focused on building.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n‍\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen it comes to the topic of blockspace, a lot of the discussion centers around the question of scalability. We’ve all seen what happens to Ethereum when demand is high: we get congestion and steep gas fees. What do you think are the most interesting, promising ways to scale blockchains and the space they offer?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou’re right that the so-called scaling problem in blockchains is a hotly debated topic. Some blockchains, like Ethereum, have taken the view that the best way to grow blockspace is through what are called L2s, or “layer twos.” L2s are systems that sit on top of a “layer one” (L1) like Ethereum. If they&#8217;re architected correctly, L2s inherit the security properties of the lower layer – so you still have the strong security guarantees of Ethereum – but they provide additional blockspace capacity on top where applications can be run with lower gas fees. There are a few prominent L2s right now: Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Aztec, and Starkware. They all take different approaches, and they&#8217;re all in various stages of development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EL2s are one way to grow supply; another way is through system design. Solana, for example, is trying to get all of its scaling on layer one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way I think blockspace grows is just simply with more L1 blockchains. You&#8217;ve got a whole series of credible layer ones in development right now. You also have bridges coming online – ways for blockchains to interoperate, sending assets and messages back and forth. Imagine a future world where you have this fabric of blockchains, all connected, and you&#8217;re moving seamlessly from one to another, depending on various technical trade-offs and community considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are philosophical and technical arguments as to which way is the best way to grow the supply of blockspace. I would personally bet on some mix of all three big methods I just outlined.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI love this image of a “fabric of blockchains.” Maybe because it sounds like another reality, it makes me think of one of my favorite pieces I’ve read on the subject of blockspace, “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.aniccaresearch.tech\u002Fblog\u002Fconsensus-capital-markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EConsensus Capital Markets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” written by Leo Zhang and Saneel Sreeni. In the piece, Zhang and Sreeni argue that blockspace will become the “central commodity of the metaverse.” Nothing seems to suggest the need for scale more than running a parallel reality on-chain. But, I’m curious, does this make sense to you? Is the metaverse a major player in the discussion of blockspace?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let’s define the term “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.a16z.com\u002F7-essential-ingredients-of-a-metaverse\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emetaverse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.” Metaverse is a catch-all phrase that describes a series of emerging technologies. It includes web3, new interfaces like VR, and just a general progression of the internet as it becomes more immersive and more central to our lives. Put simply, the metaverse can be thought of as the next wave of the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA really important question with respect to the next wave of the internet is: will it be controlled by one big company, like Meta, in a centralized way, or will it be \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F18\u002Fwhy-decentralization-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edecentralized\u003C\u002Fa\u003E like the early web? In the decentralized case, control would be held by a collection of developers, creators, and other community participants, who all work together through common standards and systems, including blockchains. To the extent \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Fstory\u002Fhow-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ethe decentralized vision wins\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, blockchains will be extremely important as a way to set the rules of the network, hold assets and virtual goods, and store other shared information. Blockchains are the first way you can have “state” data – in the computer memory sense – on the internet that&#8217;s owned by a community as opposed to owned by a corporation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo circle back to the question, I view blockspace as a new, emerging, critical computing resource alongside traditional computing resources like bandwidth, storage, compute, etc. If the web3 vision plays out, blockspace will probably be the most important new computing resource of the 2020s.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe analogies we’re using so far are grounded in traditional computing, but I wonder what you think of other framings. For example, some argue that blockspace should really be thought of as a commodity like land, oil, or grain. (The Zhang and Sreeni piece takes this tact.) Starting from that perspective opens up new ways of reasoning by analogy. For example, since other commodities have markets, will blockspace? To what extent will we see this new “substance” get financialized?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost blockspace will not be fungible, in my view, which will limit the financialization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile blockspace may be fungible within a single chain, between blockchains, there will be technical trade-offs in areas such as security and performance. More importantly, different blockchains have different communities around them. Therefore, it will mean something different to have a virtual good or a game on one blockchain versus another, in the same way, that it&#8217;s different to post on LinkedIn versus Facebook versus Twitter. Different networks, different contexts and communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI expect we’ll see new innovations that help make the experience of bidding for blockspace more efficient and fair. There are already gas auction systems that financialize blockspace within single blockchains like Ethereum. But I think more broadly, there will be a tapestry of blockchains. Different blockchains will have different communities, and there generally won’t be fungible assets across blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou mention improvements around bidding, but I imagine there are many other innovations you expect to see. I’m curious to hear what excites you most these days. Where do you see the opportunity?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re continuing to see innovation in core L1 blockchains. For example, there are a couple of projects that spun out of Meta we&#8217;re involved with that have interesting new distributed systems innovations. On the programming language side, there are interesting developments. For example, I’m excited about a new language called Move, which has some nice security properties. There&#8217;s a lot of interesting stuff happening around zero knowledge proofs as ways to improve both the performance and the privacy properties of blockchains. We’re making active investments there. There&#8217;s a bunch of exciting stuff happening at layer two, as mentioned above. Bridges are really important, too, to tie it all together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe still need improvements to the onboarding experience for new users. There are a whole bunch of user-experience friction points across wallets, custody, key recovery, and key management that need to be reduced. There’s also a constant need for better security and performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI expect blockchains to follow a pattern common to previous computing waves: there will be a reinforcing feedback loop between infrastructure and applications. As more applications are created, that creates greater demand for infrastructure. As the infrastructure gets better, that unlocks new applications. Economists call this “induced demand.” It&#8217;s why, when you build another lane on a highway, often you end up with more traffic; people build more stores and buildings in the area, attracting more traffic. A similar dynamic will play out with blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe there will be an unending appetite – and opportunity – for more infrastructure innovation and scaling over the next 10-to-20 years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat feels like the perfect segue to talk about the statement that originally sparked my interest in this topic. On the Bankless \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fshows.banklesshq.com\u002Fp\u002F-90-5-mental-models-for-web3-chris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epodcast\u003C\u002Fa\u003E back in November of last year, you said, “I think blockspace is the best product to be selling in the 2020s.” What did you mean by that, and what should other builders and investors take away from those words?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESelling blockspace in the 2020s will be a good business in the same way that selling PCs and broadband was in the 1990s and 2000s and that selling mobile phones was in the last decade. Whenever there&#8217;s a breakout computing wave, you get a reinforcing feedback loop that leads to exponential growth. When you’re in that cycle, it&#8217;s generally very good to be selling one of the high-quality products that people are clamoring to get. I think that will be the case for high-quality blockspace in the next decade.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1990s, there was a huge wave of investment in bandwidth, specifically in long haul fiber and switching gear. Then there was a huge collapse, and it all went under-utilized. I remember very clearly in the early 2000s, there were a lot of pessimists who said this infrastructure would never get used. At the time, you didn&#8217;t have Netflix streaming; you didn&#8217;t have YouTube streaming; you didn&#8217;t have real internet video. The internet was basically email and some web pages. So people said: Why would you want to pay 50 bucks a month or whatever for broadband just to get faster email and websites? What the pessimists underestimated was that as more broadband came online, developers and entrepreneurs would invent all sorts of great things to do with it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAround 2005, that&#8217;s when you had the launch of things like YouTube. That’s when you really started to see this flywheel kick in where the applications got better and the broadband got better. Then came the mobile wave with the iPhone in 2007, which further accelerated it. It all kind of hit. Cloud computing and social networking suddenly matured, and it led to a decade of really rapid technological improvement and expansion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that it looks like we&#8217;re entering a financial downturn – maybe analogous to the early 2000s. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw a lot of pessimists say: look at all the stuff we built that’s not very useful. But this is exactly the time when we could be entering an entrepreneurial golden period. Now is the time to go figure out: what is the YouTube or Netflix of blockspace? What are the killer apps that are going to drive this wave of computing forward? The apps may exist today already. They may be new things that don’t yet exist. We don’t know. That&#8217;s what makes this period fun and exciting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris Dixon\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is a general partner at a16z, where he leads the crypto\u002F web3 funds.

So, I asked him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, I asked him just about every question I could think of on the subject. Today’s piece is the result of that pestering and Chris’s patience. It is also, thanks to him, one of the clearest and most comprehensive discussions of blockspace and why it matters. With that, let’s jump in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EM‍ario Gabriele: OK, Chris, maybe we can start with the basics. What is blockspace?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EChris Dixon: Blockspace is space on a blockchain where you can run code and store data. Blockspace is different from traditional compute-space in that, until the advent of blockchains, software was always subordinate to hardware – and then, ultimately, to the owner of that hardware. If you write software for traditional computers, it’s the hardware owners who are in control. If Facebook writes some code and says any developer can come along and have access to a certain API, Facebook management can just change its mind and revoke access later. Because Facebook controls the hardware that the software runs on, it ultimately controls the software.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains are different in the way they&#8217;re architected: the software is in charge of the hardware. If you write software for \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F27\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eblockchains, you can write code that makes strong commitments\u003C\u002Fa\u003E; you can assure users and developers that the software will continue to run as designed. Specifically, blockchains use what&#8217;s called a consensus mechanism to make these commitments. The various hardware operators that run the network come together every so often and vote on the state of the blockchain virtual computer. There&#8217;s game theory around it that guarantees – that makes assurances under most conditions – that the software will continue to run as designed and that the integrity of the data will be maintained.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we&#8217;re seeing now is a wave of entrepreneurs and developers who are building new classes of applications that take advantage of this new computing property: that you can write code that makes strong commitments about how it’s going to behave in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat’s an interesting articulation. I haven’t seen this topic framed around the relationship between software and hardware before, but I think what we’re really talking about here is the matter of control, right?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EExactly. Let&#8217;s hypothetically say that Google introduces GoogleCoin. Google claims there will only ever be 21 million coins. But the software that powers GoogleCoin runs on servers Google controls. Because Google controls its computers, they can just change the 21 million limit to whatever they want. The software is controlled by hardware, and the hardware is controlled by Google management.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EContrast this scenario with how Bitcoin works. Bitcoin promises that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins; that scarcity is one of the factors that enables Bitcoin to have value. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F11\u002F12\u002Fthe-end-of-centralization-and-the-future-of-trust\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EYou can trust\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that Bitcoin will only ever have 21 million bitcoins because this rule is written in the Bitcoin blockchain – it&#8217;s baked into its very architecture. Even if a whole lot of the people running the Bitcoin code – the so-called Bitcoin miners – are trying to subvert those rules, it&#8217;s very, very difficult for them to do so. In the history of Bitcoin and Ethereum and other major blockchains, no one has been able to subvert those game-theoretic guarantees.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s what makes blockspace different. Developers and entrepreneurs who want to build on top of the blockchain ecosystem know what the rules are. They won’t get changed on them the way they get changed by traditional tech companies. When it comes to blockchains, instead of “don&#8217;t be evil,” it&#8217;s “can&#8217;t be evil.” The rules of the system are baked into the code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, blockspace is a unit of compute and storage that lives on blockchains and, as a result, is free from the control of hardware owners. We’ve seen many different expressions of blockspace and its surrounding mechanisms beneath that foundational definition. What do you think are the most important design considerations?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockspace exists on blockchains, and blockchains can be designed in various ways. The most important characteristic of a blockchain is its security properties. How reliable are the commitments it makes? Can you trust them? Can you trust the system can’t be subverted or hacked? That’s the most important feature.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother important feature is performance. This is related to the fees you pay when you transact on a blockchain. If you can make systems that are more performant, you can lower those fees. On a blockchain like Solana, for example, one of the nice features is the fees are low because of the way it&#8217;s designed. Now, some people would argue that you make trade-offs on the security side to get that performance. But clearly, security and performance are both top priorities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother consideration is the community around the blockchain. Some blockchains are home to communities focused on software development, building new applications, and creating valuable new internet services. Ethereum comes to mind as an example of a healthy developer community. Other blockchains focus more on speculation and gambling and, I would argue, are less healthy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo blockchains are, on the one hand, computers, so their security and performance properties matter; but they&#8217;re also social networks, and they need to have healthy communities focused on building.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n‍\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen it comes to the topic of blockspace, a lot of the discussion centers around the question of scalability. We’ve all seen what happens to Ethereum when demand is high: we get congestion and steep gas fees. What do you think are the most interesting, promising ways to scale blockchains and the space they offer?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou’re right that the so-called scaling problem in blockchains is a hotly debated topic. Some blockchains, like Ethereum, have taken the view that the best way to grow blockspace is through what are called L2s, or “layer twos.” L2s are systems that sit on top of a “layer one” (L1) like Ethereum. If they&#8217;re architected correctly, L2s inherit the security properties of the lower layer – so you still have the strong security guarantees of Ethereum – but they provide additional blockspace capacity on top where applications can be run with lower gas fees. There are a few prominent L2s right now: Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, Aztec, and Starkware. They all take different approaches, and they&#8217;re all in various stages of development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EL2s are one way to grow supply; another way is through system design. Solana, for example, is trying to get all of its scaling on layer one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way I think blockspace grows is just simply with more L1 blockchains. You&#8217;ve got a whole series of credible layer ones in development right now. You also have bridges coming online – ways for blockchains to interoperate, sending assets and messages back and forth. Imagine a future world where you have this fabric of blockchains, all connected, and you&#8217;re moving seamlessly from one to another, depending on various technical trade-offs and community considerations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are philosophical and technical arguments as to which way is the best way to grow the supply of blockspace. I would personally bet on some mix of all three big methods I just outlined.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI love this image of a “fabric of blockchains.” Maybe because it sounds like another reality, it makes me think of one of my favorite pieces I’ve read on the subject of blockspace, “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.aniccaresearch.tech\u002Fblog\u002Fconsensus-capital-markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EConsensus Capital Markets\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” written by Leo Zhang and Saneel Sreeni. In the piece, Zhang and Sreeni argue that blockspace will become the “central commodity of the metaverse.” Nothing seems to suggest the need for scale more than running a parallel reality on-chain. But, I’m curious, does this make sense to you? Is the metaverse a major player in the discussion of blockspace?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let’s define the term “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffuture.a16z.com\u002F7-essential-ingredients-of-a-metaverse\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emetaverse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.” Metaverse is a catch-all phrase that describes a series of emerging technologies. It includes web3, new interfaces like VR, and just a general progression of the internet as it becomes more immersive and more central to our lives. Put simply, the metaverse can be thought of as the next wave of the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA really important question with respect to the next wave of the internet is: will it be controlled by one big company, like Meta, in a centralized way, or will it be \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F18\u002Fwhy-decentralization-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edecentralized\u003C\u002Fa\u003E like the early web? In the decentralized case, control would be held by a collection of developers, creators, and other community participants, who all work together through common standards and systems, including blockchains. To the extent \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Fstory\u002Fhow-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ethe decentralized vision wins\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, blockchains will be extremely important as a way to set the rules of the network, hold assets and virtual goods, and store other shared information. Blockchains are the first way you can have “state” data – in the computer memory sense – on the internet that&#8217;s owned by a community as opposed to owned by a corporation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo circle back to the question, I view blockspace as a new, emerging, critical computing resource alongside traditional computing resources like bandwidth, storage, compute, etc. If the web3 vision plays out, blockspace will probably be the most important new computing resource of the 2020s.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe analogies we’re using so far are grounded in traditional computing, but I wonder what you think of other framings. For example, some argue that blockspace should really be thought of as a commodity like land, oil, or grain. (The Zhang and Sreeni piece takes this tact.) Starting from that perspective opens up new ways of reasoning by analogy. For example, since other commodities have markets, will blockspace? To what extent will we see this new “substance” get financialized?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost blockspace will not be fungible, in my view, which will limit the financialization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile blockspace may be fungible within a single chain, between blockchains, there will be technical trade-offs in areas such as security and performance. More importantly, different blockchains have different communities around them. Therefore, it will mean something different to have a virtual good or a game on one blockchain versus another, in the same way, that it&#8217;s different to post on LinkedIn versus Facebook versus Twitter. Different networks, different contexts and communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI expect we’ll see new innovations that help make the experience of bidding for blockspace more efficient and fair. There are already gas auction systems that financialize blockspace within single blockchains like Ethereum. But I think more broadly, there will be a tapestry of blockchains. Different blockchains will have different communities, and there generally won’t be fungible assets across blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou mention improvements around bidding, but I imagine there are many other innovations you expect to see. I’m curious to hear what excites you most these days. Where do you see the opportunity?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re continuing to see innovation in core L1 blockchains. For example, there are a couple of projects that spun out of Meta we&#8217;re involved with that have interesting new distributed systems innovations. On the programming language side, there are interesting developments. For example, I’m excited about a new language called Move, which has some nice security properties. There&#8217;s a lot of interesting stuff happening around zero knowledge proofs as ways to improve both the performance and the privacy properties of blockchains. We’re making active investments there. There&#8217;s a bunch of exciting stuff happening at layer two, as mentioned above. Bridges are really important, too, to tie it all together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe still need improvements to the onboarding experience for new users. There are a whole bunch of user-experience friction points across wallets, custody, key recovery, and key management that need to be reduced. There’s also a constant need for better security and performance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI expect blockchains to follow a pattern common to previous computing waves: there will be a reinforcing feedback loop between infrastructure and applications. As more applications are created, that creates greater demand for infrastructure. As the infrastructure gets better, that unlocks new applications. Economists call this “induced demand.” It&#8217;s why, when you build another lane on a highway, often you end up with more traffic; people build more stores and buildings in the area, attracting more traffic. A similar dynamic will play out with blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe there will be an unending appetite – and opportunity – for more infrastructure innovation and scaling over the next 10-to-20 years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat feels like the perfect segue to talk about the statement that originally sparked my interest in this topic. On the Bankless \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fshows.banklesshq.com\u002Fp\u002F-90-5-mental-models-for-web3-chris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epodcast\u003C\u002Fa\u003E back in November of last year, you said, “I think blockspace is the best product to be selling in the 2020s.” What did you mean by that, and what should other builders and investors take away from those words?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESelling blockspace in the 2020s will be a good business in the same way that selling PCs and broadband was in the 1990s and 2000s and that selling mobile phones was in the last decade. Whenever there&#8217;s a breakout computing wave, you get a reinforcing feedback loop that leads to exponential growth. When you’re in that cycle, it&#8217;s generally very good to be selling one of the high-quality products that people are clamoring to get. I think that will be the case for high-quality blockspace in the next decade.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1990s, there was a huge wave of investment in bandwidth, specifically in long haul fiber and switching gear. Then there was a huge collapse, and it all went under-utilized. I remember very clearly in the early 2000s, there were a lot of pessimists who said this infrastructure would never get used. At the time, you didn&#8217;t have Netflix streaming; you didn&#8217;t have YouTube streaming; you didn&#8217;t have real internet video. The internet was basically email and some web pages. So people said: Why would you want to pay 50 bucks a month or whatever for broadband just to get faster email and websites? What the pessimists underestimated was that as more broadband came online, developers and entrepreneurs would invent all sorts of great things to do with it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAround 2005, that&#8217;s when you had the launch of things like YouTube. That’s when you really started to see this flywheel kick in where the applications got better and the broadband got better. Then came the mobile wave with the iPhone in 2007, which further accelerated it. It all kind of hit. Cloud computing and social networking suddenly matured, and it led to a decade of really rapid technological improvement and expansion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that it looks like we&#8217;re entering a financial downturn – maybe analogous to the early 2000s. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw a lot of pessimists say: look at all the stuff we built that’s not very useful. But this is exactly the time when we could be entering an entrepreneurial golden period. Now is the time to go figure out: what is the YouTube or Netflix of blockspace? What are the killer apps that are going to drive this wave of computing forward? The apps may exist today already. They may be new things that don’t yet exist. We don’t know. That&#8217;s what makes this period fun and exciting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris Dixon\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is a general partner at a16z, where he leads the crypto\u002F web3 funds.

way to view technological advancement is through the lens of hardware: as new needs and use-cases emerge, chip manufacturers design special-purpose GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs optimized for specific functions and software. All major industries in tech — from cloud computing, to computer graphics, to artificial intelligence, and machine learning — have evolved to demand hardware that accelerates the speed and efficiency with which computations can run. Often, the chips for an initial function (be it storing memory, rendering graphics, or running large-scale simulations) will start out quite simply before a generalizable pattern is identified and special-purpose hardware is developed. Ideally, this hardware becomes cheaper and more accessible to consumers over time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA good historical example of this phenomenon is the evolution of the digital camera. In the 1960s, semiconductors were integrated into film cameras to automate simple functions like metering shutter speed or adjusting the size of an aperture depending on the quality of light a person was trying to capture — but the act of capturing an image in-memory was not yet possible. The first experiments with digital cameras in the 1970s evolved from the realization that you could take the concept of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fweb.archive.org\u002Fweb\u002F20101015123020\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.nobelprize.org\u002Fnobel_prizes\u002Fphysics\u002Flaureates\u002F2009\u002Fsmith_lecture.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emagnetic bubbles\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (a primitive form of storing single bits of data in-memory) and architect a charge coupled device (CCD) to absorb and store light in the form of electrons on silicon. Initial \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fpatentimages.storage.googleapis.com\u002F6d\u002F23\u002Fdc\u002F6cfb7f8f65f131\u002FUS4131919.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eoutlines of digital camera technology\u003C\u002Fa\u003E don’t even invoke the concept of megapixels, but camera resolution (not to mention speed and storage) was quite poor due to the limitations of semiconductors at the time: the first cameras had a resolution of around 0.0001 megapixels, and it took about 23 seconds for an image to pass from the buffer into memory. Tradeoffs between megapixel quantity and camera memory were tense until the 1990s when a newer sensor, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.axis.com\u002Ffiles\u002Fwhitepaper\u002Fwp_ccd_cmos_40722_en_1010_lo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ethe complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\u003C\u002Fa\u003E became cheaper to manufacture and more mainstream (by comparison, modern iPhones use CMOS and offer camera quality of around 12 megapixels).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the course of several decades, digital cameras evolved from hacked-together contraptions engineered by researchers with access to expensive semiconductors, to devices that reached the tens of thousands of dollars, to being embedded in every mobile phone, available to anyone for a few hundred or thousand dollars.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOther fields follow a similar trajectory from general to application-specific hardware. A more recent example of hardware optimization within the crypto space specifically is in cryptocurrency mining: when bitcoin mining launched in 2009, it was common for anyone to run the SHA256 hashing algorithm on a standard multi-core CPU. Over time, as mining grew more competitive, block rewards dropped, and a general understanding of why people might want a global, censorship-resistant currency grew more mainstream, an entire industry around developing more efficient hardware for mining developed. First we transitioned to GPU mining which allowed scaling from single digit mining parallelism to five digit mining parallelism, which sped up the process. And today, an ASIC rig for mining Bitcoin can compute around 90-100 terahashes\u002Fsecond — about 5 billion times more powerful than a CPU chip.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, you might view mining as just the beginning — a proof-of-concept that decentralized currencies are not only possible, but desirable. Even if we’re at an advanced stage of what ASICs for mining look like, we’re at the very beginning of what hardware for web3 will become.

Through a combination of advancements in algorithms and hardware, generating and verifying proofs has become cheaper and less computationally intensive. In many ways, these advancements mirror the democratization of technologies like the digital camera: you start out with an expensive and inefficient process before figuring out how to make things cheaper and faster. Perhaps most critically, advancements in zero-knowledge algorithms are beginning to provide alternatives to generating proof computation in servers and other centralized contexts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProof setups involve arithmetic circuits that gate the computation of a set of polynomials (which represent programs); these gates grow more complex as you attempt to scale the amount of information represented by those polynomials. Ideally, you want the range of possible outputs of a prover to be very large to decrease the likelihood that a prover will be able to computationally brute-force its way to the same number that the verifier is anticipating. (This is a concept known as collision resistance.) By increasing these numbers you increase the probabilistic security of the proof, just as in proof-of-work mining. A large number of outputs, however, can be very expensive and computationally slow to generate. This is where advancements in proving algorithms and hardware come in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EzkSNARKs, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Feprint.iacr.org\u002F2011\u002F443.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efirst introduced in 2011\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, are a key ingredient of these advancements. zkSNARKs essentially made it possible to efficiently scale the number of polynomials that can be gated, unlocking speed and more complex potential applications for zero-knowledge proofs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe “SNARK” part of zkSNARK stands for “Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge”, and the words most crucial here in the context of web3 are “succinct” and “non-interactive.” A proof in a zkSNARK is only a few hundred bytes, which makes it easy for a verifier to quickly check that a proof is correct (though, as you will see, the proof itself may take a long time to generate, for reasons I’ll explain below). The non-interactive component is also critical: a non-interactive proof saves verifiers from needing to challenge statements submitted by provers; in the blockchain context, this would require clients to go back-and-forth with a verifier, which would be time-intensive and difficult to architect. It’s important to note that when zkSNARKs were first introduced, the idea of using them for privacy-preserving blockchains or to scale transactions was not mentioned; the original paper suggests things like a third-party efficiently running computations on a large set of data without needing to download or compile the dataset. While this example is theoretically similar to the kinds of use-cases in privacy and scaling, it took a few years for people in the field to apply zkSNARKs to cryptocurrencies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Zero-knowledge proofs hit the blockchain\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first crypto protocol to implement zkSNARKs was \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fz.cash\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EZcash\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a private payments cryptocurrency developed in 2014. Zcash is a proof-of-work mining network based off of Bitcoin’s UTXO model, and is a particularly good example to look at because its improvements illustrate the way in which improvements in cryptography have led to more scalable forms of privacy. The original protocol implemented by Zcash, the Sprout protocol, used the SHA256 compression function to create elliptic curves; while this was cryptographically secure, it was also time and memory-intensive; it could take up to several minutes for a proof to be generated, and required around 3KB of memory to do so. Several years later, the Zcash core team developed a new hash, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fzcash\u002Fzcash\u002Fissues\u002F2234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBowe-Hopwood-Pedersen\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, to replace SHA256, and transitioned Zcash from Sprout \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Felectriccoin.co\u002Fblog\u002Freducing-shielded-proving-time-in-sapling\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eto the Sapling protocol\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in 2018. In addition to the newer hash, the team also used a different circuit used by the Groth16 proving system, and rearchitected the way in which they treated accounts in the network. This led to proving times of around 2.6 seconds, and 40MB of memory, making it possible to generate a proof from a mobile phone (more can be found about the upgrade \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Felectriccoin.co\u002Fblog\u002Freducing-shielded-proving-time-in-sapling\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehere\u003C\u002Fa\u003E).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUpgrades to Zcash illustrate two interesting concepts that persist across improvements in zero-knowledge proving systems. The first is that you can combine different pairings and proof systems to unlock efficiency. One might view the libraries of proving circuits, curves, constraint systems, and commitment schemes as ingredients that can be interchanged to create “zero-knowledge recipes” with varying speed, efficiency, and security assumptions. The second is that privacy is a motivating force in these improvements — if a proof is not generated on-device (a computer or mobile phone, for example), then it needs to be sent to a third party in order to be generated. This may leak the private information in question because your “private inputs” need to be sent in the clear. We can look at Zcash as an early indication that it’s possible to very quickly optimize for user-friendliness and decentralization with algorithmic improvements. Newer projects like the privacy-preserving cryptocurrency \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fironfish.network\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EIronFish\u003C\u002Fa\u003E drive this value of decentralization even further, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fironfish.network\u002Fdocs\u002Fonboarding\u002Fminer-iron-fish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eby making it possible for \u003C\u002Fa\u003Eanyone to mine and run a node directly from their web-browser.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]PLONK enters the field (no pun intended)\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2019, Ariel Gabizon, Zac Williamson, and Oana Ciobotaru published \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Feprint.iacr.org\u002F2019\u002F953.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ea paper\u003C\u002Fa\u003E proposing PLONK, a new proof system with several key advancements. The first big breakthrough was that PLONK only requires a single, universal trusted setup — the initial ceremony in which a common reference string used by provers and verifiers for a given zero-knowledge proof system is performed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Vitalik Buterin explains in his “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvitalik.ca\u002Fgeneral\u002F2019\u002F09\u002F22\u002Fplonk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EUnderstanding PLONK\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” article, a single trusted setup is desirable because “instead of there being one separate trusted setup for every program you want to prove things about, there is one single trusted setup for the whole scheme after which you can use the scheme with any program.” While Zcash had to perform a trusted setup for each instantiation of its proving system (both Sprout and Sapling), a PLONK setup can be performed once and used in perpetuity by any number of projects. In 2019, Aztec Network \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Faztec-protocol\u002Faztec-crs-the-biggest-mpc-setup-in-history-has-successfully-finished-74c6909cd0c4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eperformed a trusted setup ceremony \u003C\u002Fa\u003Ewith 176 participants; this scheme is used not only by Aztec, but by other teams pursuing zero-knowledge proof-based solutions, including \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fmatter-labs\u002Fsolidity_plonk_verifier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EMatter Labs\u002FzkSync\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fminaprotocol.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EMina\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fzcash.github.io\u002Fhalo2\u002Fconcepts\u002Farithmetization.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ea pending upcoming update to Zcash\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPLONKs are helpful for another reason: they provide relatively fast prover times; the tests performed by the proof’s authors found that a consumer-grade computer (in this case, a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.microsoft.com\u002Fen-us\u002Fsurface\u002Fdevices\u002Fsurface-pro-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESurfacePro 6\u003C\u002Fa\u003E with 16GB of RAM) could generate a proof in 23 seconds. A big caveat\u003Cb\u003E:\u003C\u002Fb\u003E it’s important to note that these are just benchmarks, and PLONK proofs, as implemented today, may take much longer to generate. This is because many of the teams implementing PLONK proofs are applying them toward zero-knowledge rollups, which need to aggregate thousands of off-chains transactions into a single proof together. These transactions are usually processed by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fblog.matter-labs.io\u002Fworlds-first-practical-hardware-for-zero-knowledge-proofs-acceleration-72bf974f8d6e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecompute-heavy provers\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which then send records of those transactions to a sequencer for publication on Ethereum’s mainnet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen looking at rollups, interesting questions emerge around how and where you target decentralization. One approach Matter Labs is taking is with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fblog.matter-labs.io\u002Fzkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EzkPorter\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a second account type for the rollup with data availability that is kept off-chain. When zkPorter is live, people will be able to choose between transacting on zkSync, which offers the full security of L1 Ethereum (and throughput of up to 2,000 transactions per second), or transacting on zkPorter which can reach up to 20,000+ transactions per second. Crucially, zkPorter is architected as a proof-of stake network that will use “Guardians” who stake tokens to keep track of the off-chain state, which will save several orders of magnitude in transaction costs while still providing a strong guarantee of security. While Matter Labs isn’t yet targeting prover decentralization, network-level decentralization is another key way that rollups can prioritize neutrality (while also unlocking speed). Aztec, the privacy-preserving rollup, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=rU7EBP3FbNg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehas spoken about a method\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to federate their prover network, allowing proofs to be generated from a mobile phone or computer. It’s important to note that all of these proposals are still early, and teams are still iterating on their approach.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOther hardware-focused approaches to blockchain-based privacy include Worldcoin, which is using the zero-knowledge proving system \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fworldcoin\u002Fsemaphore-airdrop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ESemaphore\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to create a decentralized, sybil resistant currency. To do this, Worldcoin recipients have their iris scanned by an orb that verifies that an individual has only signed up for Worldcoin once. Crucially, Worldcoin doesn’t store or leak private information from users. To sign up for Worldcoin, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fworldcoin.org\u002Fhow-the-launch-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ea person generates a Semaphore public key on their phone\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, presents the key in the form of a QR code to the orb, and has their iris scanned by Worldcoin’s orb with a hashed output. Worldoin then verifies that the hash doesn’t match with one that has already been generated, ensuring that a person only goes through the sign-up process once. By using hashes instead of storing biometric data, Worldcoin is able to use zero-knowledge proofs to preserve user privacy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]So what can and will be built?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can be very easy to stand at the tail end of a technological revolution and declare the massive economic and social changes brought about by it inevitable; someone holding an iPhone in their hand today, with all of its astounding capabilities — photography, storage, internet access, communication — is probably not thinking about all of the advancements necessary to make the technology possible. It’s just as difficult to stand at the unresolved beginning of a massive social and economic shift, with little clarity about how long it will take for changes to be fully realized.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe’re currently at a very early moment in what will be a long series of advancements in zero-knowledge proving schemes — but the improvements in speed, efficiency, user-friendliness, and decentralization, just in the past decade, have been astounding. We’ve gone from very few consumer-facing applications in the zero-knowledge space, to an entire ecosystem of applications and blockchains for privacy and scalability in a very short period of time. One of the most exciting things about new technologies like these ones is that it’s very difficult to predict what exactly the other side looks like. What will happen when everyone has the assurance of completely private transactions they can prove from a mobile phone, and settle on a trustless blockchain that plays host to a multitude of decentralized applications? Or a world where everyone has the right to redeem the same borderless, decentralized currency? While we live through the shift, it’s important to keep in mind the core values that have guided this space from the beginning: accessibility, trustlessness, and most importantly, decentralization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThanks to Sam Ragsdale, Eddy Lazzarin, Guy Wuollet, Ali Yahya, and Dan Boneh for their feedback and\u002For discussions that informed this piece.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E***\u003C\u002Fi\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

For example, the Domain Name System, the internet’s “phone book”, is controlled by a distributed network of people and organizations, using rules that are created and administered in the open. This means that anyone who adheres to community standards can own a domain name and establish an internet presence. It also means that the power of companies operating web and email hosting is kept in check &#8212; if they misbehave, customers can port their domain names to competing providers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the mid 2000s to the present, trust in open protocols was replaced by trust in corporate management teams. As companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook built software and services that surpassed the capabilities of open protocols, users migrated to these more sophisticated platforms. But their code was proprietary, and their governing principles could change on a whim.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do social networks decide which users to verify or ban?

This has only recently become possible, thanks to technologies arising from the blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere has been a lot of talk in the past few years about blockchains, which are heavily hyped but poorly understood. Blockchains \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F27\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eare networks of\u003C\u002Fa\u003E physical computers that work together in concert to form a single virtual computer. The benefit is that, unlike a traditional computer, a blockchain computer can offer strong trust guarantees, rooted in the mathematical and game-theoretic properties of the system. A user or developer can trust that a piece of code running on a blockchain computer will continue to behave as designed, even if individual participants in the network change their motivations or try to subvert the system. This means that the control of a blockchain computer can be placed in the hands of a community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers who depend on proprietary platforms, on the other hand, have to worry about data getting stolen or misused, privacy policies changing, intrusive advertising, and more. Proprietary platforms may suddenly change the rules for developers and businesses, the way Facebook famously did to Zynga and Google did to Yelp.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do social networks decide which users to verify or ban? &#8230; The pendulum is swinging back to an internet governed by open, community-controlled services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea that corporate-owned services could be replaced by community-owned services may sound far-fetched, but there is a strong historical precedent in the transformation of software over the past twenty years. In the 1990s, computing was dominated by proprietary, closed-source software, most notably Windows. Today, billions of Android phones run on the open source operating system Linux. Much of the software running on an Apple device is open source, as is almost all modern cloud data centers including Amazon’s. The recent acquisitions of Github by Microsoft and Red Hat by IBM underscore how dominant open source has become.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs open source has grown in importance, technology companies have shifted their business models from selling software to delivering cloud-based services. Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix are all services companies. Even Microsoft is now primarily a services company. This has allowed these companies to outpace the growth of open source software and maintain control of critical internet infrastructure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA core insight in the design of blockchains is that the open source model can be extended beyond software to cloud-based services by adding financial incentives to the mix. Cryptocurrencies &#8212; coins and tokens built into specific blockchains &#8212; provide a way to incentivize individuals and groups to participate in, maintain, and build services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere has been a lot of talk in the past few years about blockchains, which are heavily hyped but poorly understood.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea that an internet service could have an associated coin or token may be a novel concept, but the blockchain and cryptocurrencies can do for cloud-based services what open source did for software. It took twenty years for open source software to supplant proprietary software, and it could take just as long for open services to supplant proprietary services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the benefits of such a shift will be immense.

The benefit is that, unlike a traditional computer, a blockchain computer can offer strong trust guarantees, rooted in the mathematical and game-theoretic properties of the system. A user or developer can trust that a piece of code running on a blockchain computer will continue to behave as designed, even if individual participants in the network change their motivations or try to subvert the system.

In the 1990s, computing was dominated by proprietary, closed-source software, most notably Windows. Today, billions of Android phones run on the open source operating system Linux. Much of the software running on an Apple device is open source, as is almost all modern cloud data centers including Amazon’s. The recent acquisitions of Github by Microsoft and Red Hat by IBM underscore how dominant open source has become.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs open source has grown in importance, technology companies have shifted their business models from selling software to delivering cloud-based services. Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix are all services companies. Even Microsoft is now primarily a services company. This has allowed these companies to outpace the growth of open source software and maintain control of critical internet infrastructure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA core insight in the design of blockchains is that the open source model can be extended beyond software to cloud-based services by adding financial incentives to the mix.

We’ve gone from barely detecting cats in YouTube videos to building cars that can drive themselves. And yet, as our aspirations for AI have become grander, it has slowly become a game that only tech giants can play. The knowledge and resources that are necessary to innovate in the space are now simply out of reach for most individuals and startups. How can we change that? The only answer is to build new technology that levels the playing field.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA common refrain in 2018 was “AI is communist; crypto is libertarian.” It was said first by Peter Thiel as a tongue-in-cheek observation that, while crypto is a technology movement that strives to decentralize power, AI is another that can’t seem to help but centralize it. This might ring true: crypto is a technology that is all about building systems that are owned and controlled by diverse communities, whereas AI today is one that relies on consolidation of data and tends to supercharge a central entity’s ability to make top-down decisions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the past decade, this view has become our dominant narrative about AI. Nary a week goes by without headlines that bemoan the excesses of the concentrated power now wielded by tech giants and how it tragically undermines democracy, corrupts youths, causes reflux, etc. Much of society now seems to assume that the only way we can ever hope to wrest that power away from the likes of Google and Facebook is, ironically, through the exercise of yet another kind of centralized power—top-down and inevitably heavy-handed government regulation. The truth is, however, that it’s a monumental failure of imagination for us to believe that we are at the end of history — that not a single path forward exists for a startup to build technology that shifts the balance of power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is almost natural to think that there is something inherent to AI that lends advantages to large players — that AI is inescapably “communist.” The story that people like to tell focuses on how tech giants hoard all of our personal data and benefit from unassailable “data network effects.” But the real reason that tech giants are good at AI is actually much simpler. They are good at it because they invest in it. They have every reason to do so. For tech giants, AI is a technology that enhances existing lines of business — in the words of Clay Christensen, it’s a sustaining innovation, not a disruptive one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd true, there is no denying that having a lot of data does in fact lend giants an advantage. Large datasets of training examples are still a crucial input to even our most data-efficient Machine Learning algorithms, and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon.

The world is radically nonlinear. One does not simply model it with a quilt of stitched-together linear functions, for, as it turns out, the future and the unseen are often unrecognizably different from the past and the seen.

Ethereum is the first example of such a computer. It extended the ideas behind Bitcoin by including support for a general purpose programming language. Since then, it has unquestionably become one of the most important projects in the space.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut why is this kind of computer even useful?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is truly novel about this mode of computation is that its security and trust model emerges bottom up from its users — users who can be anyone, anywhere, and can participate without anyone’s permission. Control over this collective computer is literally decentralized. There are no gatekeepers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is, of course, that many of those users are no doubt dishonest and would rather like to game the system for profit if they could. The genius at the heart of Ethereum and Bitcoin (and crypto more generally) is a set of incentive structures that makes these systems self-policing. Through well-calibrated economic rewards, cryptonetworks like Ethereum encourage their users to keep one another in check. And so, even though they may not trust one another, they can come to trust in the decentralized computer that they are collectively helping secure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe defining property of such a computer is therefore that everyone can come to trust (and verify) that the programs that are deployed to it will indeed run and will run correctly \u003Cem\u003Eas written\u003C\u002Fem\u003E no matter what. This is why these programs have come to be known as &#8220;smart contracts.&#8221;  A better term for them, however, might be &#8220;sovereign programs&#8221; because, once deployed, they are independent — they deterministically execute themselves, instruction by instruction, subject to nobody&#8217;s authority. They run with immunity from intervention by (1) the people who originally wrote them; (2) the people who interact with them while they are running; and (3) even the people who control the physical machines that execute them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is this inviolable sovereignty that allows a smart contract to credibly act as a trusted intermediary between strangers. In fact, it is exactly this property that empowers a single program — e.g. the Bitcoin codebase — to come alive as a fully digital, global store of value. But that&#8217;s just the beginning. Smart contracts are a fundamentally new computational building block that is very general. They unlock a realm of possible applications that we have barely begun to explore. A few of them might even have something to do with A.I.!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is, in fact, a coincidence that’s worthy of good sci-fi that, as a considerable subset of humanity finds itself doggedly working toward strong AI, another subset (conveniently disjoint from the first) is set on building an unstoppable world computer.

No need to make it Skynet. Let’s instead think through a network that is dead simple — say, a classifier that accepts as input an image and produces as output a prediction of what it thinks the image contains (e.g. “car,” “dog,” “honey badger,” “the number three,” etc.).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the beginning, our model will be untrained, so it won’t be very useful. Training it would normally require us to collect (or somehow already have on hand) a broad corpus of labeled data that is representative of the kinds of images that we’d like our model to do well on. And, let’s not forget, if there’s any hope that our model will be able to perform well across the board, this dataset of training examples must include images that come straight from the long tail. The many exotic variations of each object must somehow be represented.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe could, of course, do what Google usually does and scour the Earth, brute force, for all of the right data — labeled images of the many kinds of cars, dogs, and honey badgers in all sorts of funky poses and lighting conditions. But, let’s be real, that playbook is old news. A new playbook is to harness market forces. Instead of exhaustively turning over every last stone in search of bits, we could enlist a broader community to collect the data for us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to create a two-sided market by building the right incentive structures into our smart contract. On the supply side, people who have access to the prized bits of data can get paid if they contribute them (in labeled form) to our nascent neural net. And, on the demand side, developers who would like to leverage the intelligence of our neural net can pay a fee to make use of it as an API and get its prediction for what some unknown image contains (again “car,” “honey badger,” etc.).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce this kind of economic venue is bootstrapped and reaches critical mass, it sets off a self-reinforcing feedback loop of improvement: More capital deployed by our neural net leads to the crowdsourcing of more esoteric data, which leads to improved model accuracy, which leads to increasing demand from developers, which leads to even more capital deployed by our neural net.

Why should a willing supply side show up with data, if the demand side doesn’t already exist? And, contrariwise, why would the demand side ever pay good money for the mad ravings of an untrained neural network? The cold-start problem is the key challenge that every startup to have ever bootstrapped a multi-sided market, like Airbnb or Uber, has had to overcome. A minimum level of activation energy is required to spark the virtuous engine into motion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis initial energy must come from somewhere. Traditionally, it has always come from financial capital — venture funding that’s provided by a set of people that tends to be completely disjoint from the set of participants in the network itself. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have historically raised enormous amounts of money to subsidize one or both sides of their marketplaces with cash in order to get the flywheel started. This is capital-intensive and misses a huge opportunity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine for a second a world in which Uber had raised less money than it did and, instead of subsidizing the supply side of its new marketplace with only cash, it had also rewarded early drivers with a small amount of ownership in Uber (the company). In that world, the very first Uber drivers would no doubt appreciate the fact that their hard-earned ownership stake in Uber (albeit small, at first) could someday be worth a lot of money. Could that fact alone help persuade some of them to participate? How much more loyal would those drivers be to Uber over some of its competitors? Would they be more likely to evangelize Uber to other people? And, as Uber grew and each driver’s ownership began to be worth real money, would it inspire the next cohort of drivers to jump onboard?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no reason that the capital needed to get a multi-sided marketplace off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ccite\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fshare?text=There is no reason that the capital needed to get a multi-sided marketplace off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources.&amp;url=https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Flong-tail-problem-in-a-i\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter-share\"\u003E\u003Ci class=\"icon-twitter\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EShare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a fundamentally more efficient capital structure for a multi-sided market.

Of course, the fees that our contract charges them would have to be small at the start, but as our model’s accuracy improves, they can begin to increase.

For many of those companies, everything tended to look great until, like quicksand, the platform’s rules began to shift. Rules that were once generous to developers conveniently morphed into ones that are now more favorable to the platform. Along the way, entire companies have been dragged down by the undertow, often beneath the suffocating sand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is because the core protocols of the internet (i.e. TCP\u002FIP) are decentralized, that it is possible for trillion-dollar companies like Google to be built on top of them.

We’ve gone from barely detecting cats in YouTube videos to building cars that can drive themselves. And yet, as our aspirations for AI have become grander, it has slowly become a game that only tech giants can play. The knowledge and resources that are necessary to innovate in the space are now simply out of reach for most individuals and startups. How can we change that? The only answer is to build new technology that levels the playing field.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA common refrain in 2018 was “AI is communist; crypto is libertarian.” It was said first by Peter Thiel as a tongue-in-cheek observation that, while crypto is a technology movement that strives to decentralize power, AI is another that can’t seem to help but centralize it. This might ring true: crypto is a technology that is all about building systems that are owned and controlled by diverse communities, whereas AI today is one that relies on consolidation of data and tends to supercharge a central entity’s ability to make top-down decisions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the past decade, this view has become our dominant narrative about AI. Nary a week goes by without headlines that bemoan the excesses of the concentrated power now wielded by tech giants and how it tragically undermines democracy, corrupts youths, causes reflux, etc. Much of society now seems to assume that the only way we can ever hope to wrest that power away from the likes of Google and Facebook is, ironically, through the exercise of yet another kind of centralized power—top-down and inevitably heavy-handed government regulation. The truth is, however, that it’s a monumental failure of imagination for us to believe that we are at the end of history — that not a single path forward exists for a startup to build technology that shifts the balance of power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is almost natural to think that there is something inherent to AI that lends advantages to large players — that AI is inescapably “communist.” The story that people like to tell focuses on how tech giants hoard all of our personal data and benefit from unassailable “data network effects.” But the real reason that tech giants are good at AI is actually much simpler. They are good at it because they invest in it. They have every reason to do so. For tech giants, AI is a technology that enhances existing lines of business — in the words of Clay Christensen, it’s a sustaining innovation, not a disruptive one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd true, there is no denying that having a lot of data does in fact lend giants an advantage. Large datasets of training examples are still a crucial input to even our most data-efficient Machine Learning algorithms, and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. But nonetheless, at the very foundation of tech giants’ towering strength in AI, there exists an almost invisible hairline crack.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is now an opportunity for startups to coordinate human energy at an unprecedented scale by building technology that better harnesses market forces.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ccite\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fshare?text=There is now an opportunity for startups to coordinate human energy at an unprecedented scale by building technology that better harnesses market forces.&amp;url=https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Flong-tail-problem-in-a-i\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter-share\"\u003E\u003Ci class=\"icon-twitter\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EShare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding AI systems today is increasingly a problem of coordinating large-scale and widespread data-collection efforts.

Our work was part of a broader strategy to gain a data advantage by harnessing one of Google’s core strengths — its ability to build large-scale systems. We set out to enable a collection of robots, each learning independently from its own environment, to contribute their real-time experience to a central neural network whose job it was to inform the actions of all the robots.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, we wanted to build a hivemind.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo test it, we set up a door-opening challenge.

Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C\u002Fem\u003E that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces.” Human thinking somehow has the power to tell apart what is fundamental from what is merely incidental and thus can generalize to the long tail without us having to experience it directly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair, the inductive model at the heart of a deep neural network also has some power of generalization, but there’s a catch. The key inductivist assumption is that the future will resemble the past and the unseen will resemble the seen. And true, sometimes it does. More often, however, the reality is otherwise. The world is radically nonlinear. One does not simply model it with a quilt of stitched-together linear functions, for, as it turns out, the future and the unseen are often unrecognizably different from the past and the seen. As a case in point, think of the inner workings at the center of a distant star whose light began its long journey towards Earth thousands of years ago. There is nothing that even remotely resembles the environment of that star here on Earth.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout an explanation for why a pattern that so reliably holds in the common case should continue to hold in cases that are less common (the edge cases), a deep neural network’s strides become just as blind as they are confident when they venture into the long tail. The darkness of that realm, for a neural network, can be illuminated only by direct experience with it — real training examples drawn from the long tail itself that can help mold the network&#8217;s linear predilections into better fitting nonlinear ones. But, of course, those training examples are, by definition, outliers and the hardest to come across.

Ethereum is the first example of such a computer. It extended the ideas behind Bitcoin by including support for a general purpose programming language. Since then, it has unquestionably become one of the most important projects in the space.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut why is this kind of computer even useful?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is truly novel about this mode of computation is that its security and trust model emerges bottom up from its users — users who can be anyone, anywhere, and can participate without anyone’s permission. Control over this collective computer is literally decentralized. There are no gatekeepers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is, of course, that many of those users are no doubt dishonest and would rather like to game the system for profit if they could. The genius at the heart of Ethereum and Bitcoin (and crypto more generally) is a set of incentive structures that makes these systems self-policing. Through well-calibrated economic rewards, cryptonetworks like Ethereum encourage their users to keep one another in check. And so, even though they may not trust one another, they can come to trust in the decentralized computer that they are collectively helping secure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe defining property of such a computer is therefore that everyone can come to trust (and verify) that the programs that are deployed to it will indeed run and will run correctly \u003Cem\u003Eas written\u003C\u002Fem\u003E no matter what. This is why these programs have come to be known as &#8220;smart contracts.&#8221;  A better term for them, however, might be &#8220;sovereign programs&#8221; because, once deployed, they are independent — they deterministically execute themselves, instruction by instruction, subject to nobody&#8217;s authority. They run with immunity from intervention by (1) the people who originally wrote them; (2) the people who interact with them while they are running; and (3) even the people who control the physical machines that execute them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is this inviolable sovereignty that allows a smart contract to credibly act as a trusted intermediary between strangers. In fact, it is exactly this property that empowers a single program — e.g. the Bitcoin codebase — to come alive as a fully digital, global store of value. But that&#8217;s just the beginning. Smart contracts are a fundamentally new computational building block that is very general. They unlock a realm of possible applications that we have barely begun to explore.

No need to make it Skynet.

Training it would normally require us to collect (or somehow already have on hand) a broad corpus of labeled data that is representative of the kinds of images that we’d like our model to do well on. And, let’s not forget, if there’s any hope that our model will be able to perform well across the board, this dataset of training examples must include images that come straight from the long tail. The many exotic variations of each object must somehow be represented.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe could, of course, do what Google usually does and scour the Earth, brute force, for all of the right data — labeled images of the many kinds of cars, dogs, and honey badgers in all sorts of funky poses and lighting conditions. But, let’s be real, that playbook is old news. A new playbook is to harness market forces. Instead of exhaustively turning over every last stone in search of bits, we could enlist a broader community to collect the data for us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to create a two-sided market by building the right incentive structures into our smart contract. On the supply side, people who have access to the prized bits of data can get paid if they contribute them (in labeled form) to our nascent neural net. And, on the demand side, developers who would like to leverage the intelligence of our neural net can pay a fee to make use of it as an API and get its prediction for what some unknown image contains (again “car,” “honey badger,” etc.).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce this kind of economic venue is bootstrapped and reaches critical mass, it sets off a self-reinforcing feedback loop of improvement: More capital deployed by our neural net leads to the crowdsourcing of more esoteric data, which leads to improved model accuracy, which leads to increasing demand from developers, which leads to even more capital deployed by our neural net. And around the flywheel we go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s dive into how exactly we could get this to work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[toc-embed]Solving the Cold-Start Problem\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first hard problem is getting our marketplace off the ground. Why should a willing supply side show up with data, if the demand side doesn’t already exist? And, contrariwise, why would the demand side ever pay good money for the mad ravings of an untrained neural network? The cold-start problem is the key challenge that every startup to have ever bootstrapped a multi-sided market, like Airbnb or Uber, has had to overcome. A minimum level of activation energy is required to spark the virtuous engine into motion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis initial energy must come from somewhere. Traditionally, it has always come from financial capital — venture funding that’s provided by a set of people that tends to be completely disjoint from the set of participants in the network itself. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have historically raised enormous amounts of money to subsidize one or both sides of their marketplaces with cash in order to get the flywheel started. This is capital-intensive and misses a huge opportunity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine for a second a world in which Uber had raised less money than it did and, instead of subsidizing the supply side of its new marketplace with only cash, it had also rewarded early drivers with a small amount of ownership in Uber (the company). In that world, the very first Uber drivers would no doubt appreciate the fact that their hard-earned ownership stake in Uber (albeit small, at first) could someday be worth a lot of money. Could that fact alone help persuade some of them to participate? How much more loyal would those drivers be to Uber over some of its competitors? Would they be more likely to evangelize Uber to other people? And, as Uber grew and each driver’s ownership began to be worth real money, would it inspire the next cohort of drivers to jump onboard?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no reason that the capital needed to get a multi-sided marketplace off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ccite\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fshare?text=There is no reason that the capital needed to get a multi-sided marketplace off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources.&amp;url=https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Flong-tail-problem-in-a-i\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter-share\"\u003E\u003Ci class=\"icon-twitter\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EShare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a fundamentally more efficient capital structure for a multi-sided market. There is no reason that the capital that is needed to get it off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources. Some of it can come from the participants themselves, for they have human and production capital to contribute. In the case of Uber, each driver puts forth their driving ability and their car to help the network get off the ground.

So, why not build into it the ability to mint freely tradable tokens that grant whoever holds them a claim to all revenue that flows through it?

And, as the flywheel is set into motion, the service it offers will begin to become useful to the demand side too — i.e., developers willing to pay real money for its predictions. Of course, the fees that our contract charges them would have to be small at the start, but as our model’s accuracy improves, they can begin to increase. Higher fees can then be used to further incentivize data contributions which, in turn, improve the model, and so again, around the flywheel we go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key idea is that a market that is owned by its participants acts on its region of influence like a magnetic coil does on iron filings.

I’ll briefly mention a few.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe must, for example, build into our smart contract a mechanism that can reliably measure signal in the data that is contributed to it. It must have logic that is capable of telling apart garbage data from the real thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA possible solution is to enable our smart contract to access a secret benchmark dataset that it can use to measure its own performance. Data contributions that improve the neural net’s accuracy on the benchmark can be rewarded, whereas those that don’t might incur a fee.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA related problem is that, because the state of all smart contracts today is visible on the blockchain to anyone who wishes to look, it would be trivial for an attacker to steal the underlying neural net (once trained) and bypass the need to pay for its predictions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solution to this whole family of problems depends on the existence of smart contracts whose execution is still verifiable by anyone, but whose internal state is encrypted. Such programs are called “private smart contracts,” and they are an active area of research in the space. One approach to building them is based on a kind of cryptographic proof (known as a zk-SNARK) that can mathematically convince any observer that a computation was performed correctly without revealing any of the underlying state. And, there are many other approaches in the works.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe challenges are formidable, but solutions are well underway.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[toc-embed]Extending the Internet\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen all is said and done, our neural network will be an autonomous entity in the world whose intelligence will have emerged from the grassroots efforts of countless individuals who are laboring independently to discover and contribute signal from wherever they may be.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe will have built a Decentralized Autonomous Hivemind — a hivemind that is true to form and, unlike the one I worked on at Google, would make the eight-year-old boy inside of me proud. And, from there, it’s but a small leap to imagine a future that includes a vast and open ecosystem of countless such hiveminds, each one brought to life by its own community and serving as a modular building block that anyone, large or small, can use to build products.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aggregate of all those building blocks can thus begin to emerge as a new protocol layer that extends the capabilities of the internet itself. It will be a fabric of intelligence that, like the internet, will be open source and controlled collectively by its own community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it is precisely because control over such a network will be decentralized that it has the potential to scale to millions of developers and contributors. No platform ever gets to that scale without making an ironclad commitment to uphold its own promises over time. And there is no better way for a platform to make that guarantee than by engraving its own rules into a sovereign program that is owned and governed by the very people who build on top of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is, after all, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcdixon\u002Fstatus\u002F965268012621217792\"\u003EWhy Decentralization Matters\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. The core idea behind Chris Dixon’s argument is that decentralization — and therefore crypto — matters because it addresses the problem of platform risk. History is full of countless forgotten companies that were tempted to build entirely on top of centralized platforms. For many of those companies, everything tended to look great until, like quicksand, the platform’s rules began to shift. Rules that were once generous to developers conveniently morphed into ones that are now more favorable to the platform. Along the way, entire companies have been dragged down by the undertow, often beneath the suffocating sand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is because the core protocols of the internet (i.e. TCP\u002FIP) are decentralized, that it is possible for trillion-dollar companies like Google to be built on top of them. By that same token, it is inconceivable that a company the size of Google could be built on top of Google, in the same way that Google was built on top of TCP\u002FIP.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat might it be possible to build on top of a decentralized network of market-powered neural nets?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[toc-embed]The Power of Markets\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s go back to the question that we started with.

Such problems are made difficult for a central planner by the fact that the information needed to solve them is strewn about widely and locked away in countless remote places and unknown minds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe people who are best equipped to harness the various pockets of localized knowledge that these problems demand are those who are closest to those pockets, not the monolithic entity at the center that’s trying to do all of the planning and commanding top-down.

We experienced ambushes, IEDs, where seven of them were actually wounded. But for all the intensity of the combat, the centerpiece of our strategy was actually not fighting, because we were waging a counterinsurgency. And in a counterinsurgency, the key terrain is the hearts and minds of the people. And the insurgents take advantage of and ride a wave of social and economic grievances, often legitimate.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we were to win, we had to address those grievances. And so, for as much time as we&#8217;ve spent doing combat patrols, we spent even more time trying to develop the local economy. In particular, we wanted to improve the lot of one group of people, which were the farmers that lived there in this province where we were. Afghanistan, or at least this area, was an agrarian economy. It consisted of subsistence farming, where a single failed harvest could result in devastation for not just a single family, but for an entire community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe wanted to address that problem. And so an idea we came up with for our program to run was called crop diversification. For crop diversification, we would subsidize farmers to essentially diversify the crops they grew year over year. And that meant less frequent crop failures because more healthy soil. It meant less intense effects for any family or the overall community.

Afghanistan, or at least this area, was an agrarian economy. It consisted of subsistence farming, where a single failed harvest could result in devastation for not just a single family, but for an entire community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe wanted to address that problem.

This allows members to decide on the values of the enterprise, which don’t necessarily need to be about the maximization of profits. In fact, cooperatives tend to be most successful where there’s alignment on other values such as: 1) a communal benefit to pooling resources, for economies of scale; and 2) an attendant desire to avoid anti-competitive or extractive behavior.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUpholding a commitment to these values isn’t merely a social endeavor &#8212; it can be good for business too, both in terms of direct return on investment and downstream value creation. This is true because as a cooperative grows, it takes on economies of scale that can increase the value of membership for all participants. Early participants can use their newfound surplus for additional access to the product or service (creating more downstream value), or take profits by selling surplus to new members to earn a return (the direct investment value).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ica.coop\u002Fen\u002Fcooperatives\u002Ffacts-and-figures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EInternational Co-op Alliance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, cooperatives are not just marginal phenomena &#8212; at least 12% of the population is in “cooperatives”; co-ops “provide jobs or work opportunities to 10% of the employed population”; and the 300 top coops and groups also generate $2.1 trillion “in turnover while providing the services and infrastructure society needs to thrive”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThose are just some of the numbers.

Historically, it’s been a lot harder to coordinate investment from members with shared values than it is to raise funds with the singular goal of maximizing profits. There are also logistical challenges in everything from distributing information to bootstrapping the co-op so that it reaches a \u003Ci\u003Eminimum\u003C\u002Fi\u003E viable threshold where it actually delivers utility to its members.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EThen, even once over the bootstrap hump, cooperatives can struggle to compete with more traditional entrants, who are often better funded. For example, in the early 1990s, many member-owned stock exchanges elected to “demutualize” or convert from member-owned organizations to for-profit, investor-owned ones (Visa did this as well when it went public). This coincided with the advance of the internet, which democratized access to markets and increased competition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EFinally, cooperatives tend to have more complex governance processes than companies with simple top-down management structures. The challenge for co-ops is to ensure that the often pluralist values of their members are accurately represented and upheld, while also preserving operational efficiency. Many successful cooperatives have therefore combined formal management hierarchies with thoughtful permissioning by members (as opposed to flat, direct democracies).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003E[toc-embed]Cooperative networks: thoughts for crypto\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile policymakers (and users) around the world debate whether internet networks should be regulated as public utilities, cryptonetworks are pioneering a new form of “cooperative capitalism” with networks that are owned by users and workers, rather than by third-party shareholders.

Originally part of Bank of America (and called BankAmericard), the credit card network struggled to gain the ubiquity required for widespread consumer adoption.

This grew the network effects of the platform, while protecting the individual members from fees that could be extracted had a centralized third party aggregated them instead.

But when it comes to innovation, there are some structural issues that have worked against cooperative enterprises, from coordination costs to growth to governance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, cooperatives are more difficult to bootstrap than corporations because they don’t have access to the same capital markets. Historically, it’s been a lot harder to coordinate investment from members with shared values than it is to raise funds with the singular goal of maximizing profits. There are also logistical challenges in everything from distributing information to bootstrapping the co-op so that it reaches a \u003Ci\u003Eminimum\u003C\u002Fi\u003E viable threshold where it actually delivers utility to its members.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EThen, even once over the bootstrap hump, cooperatives can struggle to compete with more traditional entrants, who are often better funded. For example, in the early 1990s, many member-owned stock exchanges elected to “demutualize” or convert from member-owned organizations to for-profit, investor-owned ones (Visa did this as well when it went public). This coincided with the advance of the internet, which democratized access to markets and increased competition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003C\u002Fb\u003EFinally, cooperatives tend to have more complex governance processes than companies with simple top-down management structures. The challenge for co-ops is to ensure that the often pluralist values of their members are accurately represented and upheld, while also preserving operational efficiency. Many successful cooperatives have therefore combined formal management hierarchies with thoughtful permissioning by members (as opposed to flat, direct democracies).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E[toc-embed]Cooperative networks: thoughts for crypto\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile policymakers (and users) around the world debate whether internet networks should be regulated as public utilities, cryptonetworks are pioneering a new form of “cooperative capitalism” with networks that are owned by users and workers, rather than by third-party shareholders.

And this plays out on two-dimensions: control over the end-user experience, and more granular control over the economics of the supply-side resources of the network. An assumption of “server era” architectures is that network resources, such-as security, storage, and compute are demand constrained. That is, they can be scaled up, on demand, as the application gains adoption. This stands in contrast to “mainframe era” architectures where resource costs vary as a function of all of the other traffic on the network. The theory is that a full-stack “server era” architectures can mitigate the risk of a gentrifying “mainframe” chain.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Server era” blockchains are different from their full-stack platform predecessors in that they’re still blockchains!

Rather than running a single virtual machine, these blockchain computers require new standards for communicating with one another in order to enable composition across applications. These communication interfaces are the subject of ongoing research and standardization, and will no doubt add complexity to the developer experience with regards to composibility. But in spite of that drawback, the benefits of a bundle may prove to be the catalyst for a new wave of blockchain architectures and I expect we’ll see many more projects taking a full-stack approach in the near term.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[toc-embed]The “cloud era”\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe “cloud era” is meant to invoke a scalable, generalized substrate for trustless computation.

Proponents of “server era” architectures posit that a “cloud era” experience will emerge through standardization and abstraction of inter-blockchain communication among heterogeneous blockchains. Others, like Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) and Dfinity, are converging on sharded versions of homogenous, turing-complete chains. You can think of this as a world of many “mainframes” that share a pool of security, but split state and computation among homogenous virtual machines. And still others are researching entirely new architectures that move computation off-chain.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the size of the research community, and the potential prize for such a solution, I would not be surprised if “cloud era” blockchain computing is hot on the tails of the so-called “server era.” We’ve already laid the cables and built the data centers— “cloud era” blockchain computing is mostly software innovation.

But in spite of that drawback, the benefits of a bundle may prove to be the catalyst for a new wave of blockchain architectures and I expect we’ll see many more projects taking a full-stack approach in the near term.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[toc-embed]The “cloud era”\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe “cloud era” is meant to invoke a scalable, generalized substrate for trustless computation. This is the promised land, where composition is only bounded by creativity, not scale or communication complexity, and where innovation can compound without hitting diminishing returns.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow exactly this will work is very much in the realm of open research. Proponents of “server era” architectures posit that a “cloud era” experience will emerge through standardization and abstraction of inter-blockchain communication among heterogeneous blockchains. Others, like Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) and Dfinity, are converging on sharded versions of homogenous, turing-complete chains. You can think of this as a world of many “mainframes” that share a pool of security, but split state and computation among homogenous virtual machines. And still others are researching entirely new architectures that move computation off-chain.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the size of the research community, and the potential prize for such a solution, I would not be surprised if “cloud era” blockchain computing is hot on the tails of the so-called “server era.” We’ve already laid the cables and built the data centers— “cloud era” blockchain computing is mostly software innovation. Whenever we get there, it seems clear that trustless composability will be a new superpower for developers, and when developers can do more with less, we’ll all be the beneficiaries of more collaboration, creativity, and choice on the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

This meant that people or organizations could grow their internet presence knowing the rules of the game wouldn’t change later on. Huge web properties were started during this era including Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. In the process, the importance of centralized platforms like AOL greatly diminished.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the second era of the internet, from the mid 2000s to the present, for-profit tech companies — most notably Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) — built software and services that rapidly outpaced the capabilities of open protocols. The explosive growth of smartphones accelerated this trend as mobile apps became the majority of internet use. Eventually users migrated from open services to these more sophisticated, centralized services. Even when users still accessed open protocols like the web, they would typically do so mediated by GAFA software and services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that billions of people got access to amazing technologies, many of which were free to use. The bad news is that it became much harder for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presence without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them, taking away their audiences and profits. This in turn stifled innovation, making the internet less interesting and dynamic. Centralization has also created broader societal tensions, which we see in the debates over subjects like fake news, state sponsored bots, “no platforming” of users, EU privacy laws, and algorithmic biases. These debates will only intensify in the coming years.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E“Web 3”: the third era of the internet\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne response to this centralization is to impose government regulation on large internet companies. This response assumes that the internet is similar to past communication networks like the phone, radio, and TV networks. But the hardware-based networks of the past are fundamentally different than the internet, a software-based network. Once hardware-based networks are built, they are nearly impossible to rearchitect. Software-based networks can be rearchitected through entrepreneurial innovation and market forces.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is the ultimate software-based network, consisting of a relatively simple \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FInternet_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecore layer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E connecting billions of fully programmable computers at the edge. Software is simply the encoding of human thought, and as such has an almost unbounded design space. Computers connected to the internet are, by and large, free to run whatever software their owners choose. Whatever can be dreamt up, with the right set of incentives, can quickly propagate across the internet. Internet architecture is where technical creativity and incentive design intersect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is still early in its evolution: the core internet services will likely be almost entirely rearchitected in the coming decades. This will be enabled by crypto-economic networks, a generalization of the ideas first introduced in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fbitcoin.org\u002Fbitcoin.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBitcoin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and further developed in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fethereum\u002Fwiki\u002Fwiki\u002FWhite-Paper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EEthereum\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy decentralization?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization is a commonly misunderstood concept. For example, it is sometimes said that the reason cryptonetwork advocates favor decentralization is to resist government censorship, or because of libertarian political views. These are not the main reasons decentralization is important.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s look at the problems with centralized platforms. Centralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. When they start out, they do everything they can to recruit users and 3rd-party complements like developers, businesses, and media organizations. They do this to make their services more valuable, as platforms (by definition) are systems with multi-sided network effects. As platforms move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and 3rd parties steadily grows.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8389 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG.png 681w, https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F07lrwGIDbAYk6q7zG-300x129.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing lies in extracting data from users and competing with complements over audiences and profits. Historical examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, and Twitter vs. its 3rd-party clients. Operating systems like iOS and Android have behaved better, although still take a healthy 30% tax, reject apps for seemingly arbitrary reasons, and subsume the functionality of 3rd-party apps at will.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor 3rd parties, this transition from cooperation to competition feels like a bait-and-switch. Over time, the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors have become wary of building on top of centralized platforms. We now have decades of evidence that doing so will end in disappointment. In addition, users give up privacy, control of their data, and become vulnerable to security breaches. These problems with centralized platforms will likely become even more pronounced in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EEnter cryptonetworks\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptonetworks are networks built on top of the internet that 1) use consensus mechanisms such as blockchains to maintain and update state, 2) use cryptocurrencies (coins\u002Ftokens) to incentivize consensus participants (miners\u002Fvalidators) and other network participants. Some cryptonetworks, such as Ethereum, are general programming platforms that can be used for almost any purpose. Other cryptonetworks are special purpose, for example Bitcoin is intended primarily for storing value, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgolem.network\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EGolem\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for performing computations, and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffilecoin.io\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFilecoin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E for decentralized file storage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly internet protocols were technical specifications created by working groups or non-profit organizations that relied on the alignment of interests in the internet community to gain adoption. This method worked well during the very early stages of the internet but since the early 1990s very few new protocols have gained widespread adoption. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2018\u002F02\u002F18\u002F2017\u002F05\u002F27\u002Fcrypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ECryptonetworks fix\u003C\u002Fa\u003E these problems by providing economics incentives to developers, maintainers, and other network participants in the form of tokens. They are also much more technically robust. For example, they are able to keep state and do arbitrary transformations on that state, something past protocols could never do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptonetworks use multiple mechanisms to ensure that they stay neutral as they grow, preventing the bait-and-switch of centralized platforms. First, the contract between cryptonetworks and their participants is enforced in open source code. Second, they are kept in check through mechanisms for \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FExit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E“voice” and “exit.”\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Participants are given voice through community governance, both “on chain” (via the protocol) and “off chain” (via the social structures around the protocol). Participants can exit either by leaving the network and selling their coins, or in the extreme case by forking the protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, cryptonetworks align network participants to work together toward a common goal — the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This alignment is one of the main reasons Bitcoin continues to defy skeptics and flourish, even while new cryptonetworks like Ethereum have grown alongside it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday’s cryptonetworks suffer from limitations that keep them from seriously challenging centralized incumbents. The most severe limitations are around performance and scalability. The next few years will be about fixing these limitations and building networks that form the infrastructure layer of the crypto stack. After that, most of the energy will turn to building applications on top of that infrastructure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow decentralization wins\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s one thing to say decentralized networks should win, and another thing to say they will win. Let’s look at specific reasons to be optimistic about this.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware and web services are built by developers. There are millions of highly skilled developers in the world. Only a small fraction work at large technology companies, and only a small fraction of those work on new product development. Many of the most important software projects in history were created by startups or by communities of independent developers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.” — \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FJoy%27s_law_(management)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBill Joy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized networks can win the third era of the internet for the same reason they won the first era: by winning the hearts and minds of entrepreneurs and developers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn illustrative analogy is the rivalry in the 2000s between Wikipedia and its centralized competitors like Encarta. If you compared the two products in the early 2000s, Encarta was a far better product, with better topic coverage and higher accuracy. But Wikipedia improved at a much faster rate, because it had an active community of volunteer contributors who were attracted to its decentralized, community-governed ethos. By 2005, Wikipedia was the most \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002F@cdixon\u002Fit-s-hard-to-believe-today-but-10-years-ago-wikipedia-was-widely-considered-a-doomed-experiment-a7a0dfd27b8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epopular\u003C\u002Fa\u003E reference site on the internet. Encarta was shut down in 2009.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lesson is that when you compare centralized and decentralized systems you need to consider them dynamically, as processes, instead of statically, as rigid products. Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of cryptonetworks, there are multiple, compounding feedback loops involving developers of the core protocol, developers of complementary cryptonetworks, developers of 3rd party applications, and service providers who operate the network. These feedback loops are further amplified by the incentives of the associated token, which — as we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum — can supercharge the rate at which crypto communities develop (and sometimes lead to negative outcomes, as with the excessive electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question of whether decentralized or centralized systems will win the next era of the internet reduces to who will build the most compelling products, which in turn reduces to who will get more high quality developers and entrepreneurs on their side. GAFA has many advantages, including cash reserves, large user bases, and operational infrastructure. Cryptonetworks have a significantly more attractive value proposition to developers and entrepreneurs. If they can win their hearts and minds, they can mobilize far more resources than GAFA, and rapidly outpace their product development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“If you asked people in 1989 what they needed to make their life better, it was unlikely that they would have said a decentralized network of information nodes that are linked using hypertext.” — \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ffarmerandfarmer.org\u002Fmastery\u002Fbuilder.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFarmer &amp; Farmer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECentralized platforms often come bundled at launch with compelling apps: Facebook had its core socializing features and the iPhone had a number of key apps. Decentralized platforms, by contrast, often launch half-baked and without clear use cases. As a result, they need to go through two phases of product-market fit: 1) product-market fit between the platform and the developers\u002Fentrepreneurs who will finish the platform and build out the ecosystem, and 2) product-market fit between the platform\u002Fecosystem and end users. This two-stage process is what causes many people — including sophisticated technologists — to consistently underestimate the potential of decentralized platforms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EThe next era of the internet\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralized networks aren’t a silver bullet that will fix all the problems on the internet. But they offer a much better approach than centralized systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECompare the problem of Twitter spam to the problem of email spam. Since Twitter \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theverge.com\u002F2012\u002F8\u002F23\u002F3263481\u002Ftwitter-api-third-party-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eclosed\u003C\u002Fa\u003E their network to 3rd-party developers, the only company working on Twitter spam has been Twitter itself. By contrast, there were hundreds of companies that tried to fight email spam, financed by billions of dollars in venture capital and corporate funding. Email spam isn’t solved, but it’s a lot better now, because 3rd parties knew that the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FSimple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eemail protocol\u003C\u002Fa\u003E was decentralized, so they could build businesses on top of it without worrying about the rules of the game changing later on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr consider the problem of network governance. Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms. As we know from the offline world, democratic systems aren’t perfect, but they are a lot better than the alternatives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECentralized platforms have been dominant for so long that many people have forgotten there is a better way to build internet services. Cryptonetworks are a powerful way to develop community-owned networks and provide a level playing field for 3rd-party developers, creators, and businesses. We saw the value of decentralized systems in the first era of the internet. Hopefully we’ll get to see it again in the next.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

It also didn’t hurt that the price of Ethereum was increasing almost every week: I’d rationalize every wallet refill as a mix between a game of roulette and a fate-induced act of dollar-cost-averaging.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut things feel different today: The gas prices are higher, the participants are more ambitious, the bots seem more sophisticated. Opportunities now seem increasingly reserved for insiders, bots with names like “mevsniper.eth,” and people who know which NFT drops to mint straight from Etherscan (and \u003Ci\u003Ehow\u003C\u002Fi\u003E to mint straight from Etherscan). Yes, I’m a promoter of the idea that you have to fend for yourself in the dark forest, DYOR, and get rugged (note: I mean both rugged as in resilient, and rugged as in rekt). But if it grows incrementally harder for new entrants to be competitive and agile in the current paradigm, we might limit the rate at which new crypto users grow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next wave of projects should prioritize not only speed and cost, but function as well. I do wish we saw more projects that made simply having a wallet — not holding a particular currency or NFT — as the only barrier to entry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E[toc-embed]The loot that launched a thousand ships\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe past few weeks have demonstrated some promising examples.

In the words of Dom, “creators building on top of Loot can choose to recognize Synthetic Loot as a way to allow a wider range of adventurers to participate in the ecosystem, while still being able to easily differentiate between ‘original’ Loot and Synthetic Loot.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere’s what I liked about the idea of Synthetic Loot: It could serve as a port-of-entry for people who are newer to crypto. And not just an onboarding module or online curriculum — if the Synthetic Loot ecosystem had advanced at the same rate as the rest of the Lootverse, it could have inducted newcomers and less eth-rich wallet-holders smack into the middle of the most exciting movement happening in Ethereum: an experiment in gaming, governance, and coordination. The dilemma with Loot is that it really only incentivizes Loot-holders to \u003Ci\u003Eenrich the economy\u003C\u002Fi\u003E. Synthetic Loot could have \u003Ci\u003Eexpanded the range of participants much further\u003C\u002Fi\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESynthetic Loot didn’t generate as much excitement as other accessible forms of Loot, like mLoot, the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fdhof\u002Fstatus\u002F1434180216444923923\"\u003Emintable Loot expansion pack\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. From what I could gather, there was just one project that used the Synthetic contract to build off of Loot Characters and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Floot.stephancill.co.za\u002F#\u002F\"\u003Ecreate sLoot renderings\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. There’s definitely an optimistic way of viewing the way this played out. The failure of Synthetic Loot to capture the hearts of users could also speak to the values of web3: ownership above all else. Synthetic Loot is not transferable or ownable like a conventional NFT, so it may not inspire builders and users to the same degree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn’t mean the idea of accessible NFTs is less compelling.

I’m more intrigued by this emergent stage of where we are in the mainstreaming of crypto. The first non-DeFi consumer-facing dApps are beginning to scale, L1s and L2s are starting to take activity off of the Ethereum mainnet — but the very thing that’s a testament to the strength of Ethereum (its current price) may also become a chokepoint of engagement going forward.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEthereum, and crypto in general, isn’t able to lower prices at will — the cost of bootstrapping a network and incentivizing miners and stakers renders lower prices at the infrastructure layer a difficult task (such is the reality of being a decentralized network and not a multi-billion dollar telco company with an operating budget and the ability to use debt to fund capex). There are choices up-the-funnel, however, and developers have options about how to embed features that make interacting with crypto more accessible for the everyday user. I’m not suggesting that developers make things available for free (deploying a smart contract is expensive and time is irreplaceable). But where are the opportunities for more people to engage in crypto in a capacity that isn’t buying or flipping NFTs, using DeFi, or working for a DAO? And how will people learn the joy of collaboration and collective ownership over a network that has already priced them out?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be helpful to put this on a spectrum — where we are today, and what we might want to see more of in the future. On one end of the spectrum is participation through capital: This is what we saw in the emergent days of crypto networks, DeFi participation, and NFT trading. In the middle are developing forms of earning your place at the table — everything from earning DAO tokens through participation in a working group, to submitting proposals to a DAO for a specific job, to contributing to discussions on Discord, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Frabbithole.mirror.xyz\u002FZYcTE1mh5TxpGNHEPWon8KH7R3MlllJE4VhG_yJIr-M\"\u003Eto completing quests on Rabbithole\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, to play-to-earn games like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Faxieinfinity.com\u002F\"\u003EAxie Infinity\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.
