So the most margin-sensitive businesses &#8212; like the corner stores, the restaurants, the mom-and-pop shops &#8212; are probably going to be the people who are most eager to start accepting stablecoins.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re talking about taking businesses like a coffee shop &#8212; which is running, right now, on a 2% margin &#8212; and doubling it. Really, turning businesses that are hardly profitable today to being moderately profitable. A huge difference.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E This was what kind of gave me the aha moment &#8212; is when you talked about… what the small businesses \u003Cem\u003Edon&#8217;t \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eget from credit card companies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo they&#8217;re not only paying these fees, but they&#8217;re not even getting the benefits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESam:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah! What&#8217;s so remarkable about credit cards &lt;chuckles&gt; is that they offered consumers fraud protection. And that was great for bootstrapping things like online sales… But fraud protection does basically nothing when the cashier is handing you a coffee as you give them the money.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re talking about $0.30 cents per transaction, and an additional 2% on top of that. That brings a $1.50 coffee &#8212; almost $0.30 cents of that, you know, a fifth of that &#8212; &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; is going to the payment provider. They didn&#8217;t do anything in that transaction; they don&#8217;t really offer very much value.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the 2% margin that you&#8217;re giving up &#8212; is pure profit for the payment providers, and a purely a negative for your local coffee shop. I can&#8217;t wait for them to get that $0.30\u002F $0.35 cents margin back and build their businesses out. It&#8217;s very, very rare that you have the opportunity to add 2% directly to your bottom line.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E There&#8217;s a bit of a cold-start problem here, though, right? Because these customers have to have stablecoins in order to be able to use them to pay these businesses and circumvent the interchange fees… Do you think we&#8217;re going to start seeing businesses almost help promote stablecoins, and onboard people on the stablecoins, in order to reap these benefits – are-are we going to start seeing this kind of turn where businesses actually help the go-to market strategy, for stablecoins.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESam:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s my strong belief. But people have relationships with these in-person retailers, coffee shops, and corner stores: They go there often. So I think we&#8217;re going to see these strong local brands begin to bring people onto stablecoins as part of that initial adoption curve.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What I love about this is when I first started covering crypto over at Fortune, my editors would always be like: When can you buy a *coffee* with Bitcoin? And I was like: No-no-no; no, it&#8217;s not like that, that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s for.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut now it&#8217;s like; actually, that is sort of what (at least this) is for.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESam:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s exactly what it&#8217;s for. And I think they&#8217;re gonna be some of the early adopters to do it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thank you, Sam.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESam:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E See you guys. Thank you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Okay. So okay that was interesting; let&#8217;s go on to the next one &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Maggie, your big idea was a very interesting one because it&#8217;s actually focusing more on distribution, which makes perfect sense given your role is in go-to-market and you&#8217;re the head of the go-to-market team here &#8212; You talk about how crypto is finally getting its own app stores, and discovery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you want to just give us an overview of why that even matters? &#8212; Because when you hear that headline, you&#8217;re like oh that feels so inside baseball &#8212; like, why does crypto even need its own thing; isn&#8217;t it already an insider industry?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWould love you to talk about the context, what you&#8217;re observing; and why you think this is an important big idea.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaggie:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Absolutely. When I started at a16z about three years ago &#8212; and really for the past couple years –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere have been so many companies within our portfolio that have tried to launch apps on the traditional app stores &#8212; so Apple&#8217;s App Store, Google Play Store &#8212; and they&#8217;ve gotten blocked, or denied, or delayed for various reasons.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think what&#8217;s really frustrating is that if you read Apple&#8217;s guidelines, they&#8217;re confusing; one. They are not complete; so they don&#8217;t necessarily address all the questions an app developer might have. But then, the policy is applied inconsistently depending on who the reviewer is.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so we&#8217;ve had multiple companies where depending on who they get as reviewer; or another app is approved for the same thing that they were denied for… It&#8217;s incredibly inconsistent and it&#8217;s a black box. And much of it comes down to this concept of “IAP” &#8212; having to run any sort of in-app purchase through the app store &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat&#8217;s been great is that over the past several months, we are starting to see some alternatives: One great example is Solana&#8217;s Dapp Store, they&#8217;re actually fee-free. And when the Saga Phone (part 2, the second generation) comes out &#8212; I think they had something like 100,000 pre-orders &#8212; so that will only increase. Another one is the World App &#8212; so WorldCoin (or “World”), they&#8217;ve launched several mini apps &#8212; and all of these mini apps have incredible traction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd not just these, but there’re also are blockchains that are supporting different games &#8212; they&#8217;re running their marketplaces; we have infra marketplaces… &#8212; You&#8217;re starting to see so many of these, and they&#8217;re really starting to hit scale. And I think will become a really viable alternative for those traditional app stores.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s fantastic. One question that comes to mind when I hear this is &#8212; and this might be the meta question that applies to all of crypto, actually &#8212; which is: What if you have too many options?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the nice things about the world we live in with two dominant operating systems on our current mobile phones (between Apple and Android) is: It&#8217;s nice that I only have to go to one place to get something. So, like, are these apps like being listed across multiple app stores… Are they specific? &#8212; like, both WorldCoin and Solana have their own app stores &#8212; And you pointed out in your big idea that it&#8217;s also interesting because those are both companies that also have hardware, not just software: Like, in the case of World, they have the Orb. In the case of Solana, they have the Saga Phone… And that is obviously very similar to how Apple launched the iPhone, and then spawned the app ecosystem. –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, are these all going to become just filtered only through the lens of what those companies think is important? Is it going to remain open? Where do you kind of see this playing out… I mean, it&#8217;s so early days; but like, how do they all talk to each other &#8212; or should they even?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaggie:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think at this time, the goal is to get the growth of the different app stores…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you make a great point that there might be an overproliferation &#8212; we could say the same thing about the prevalence of blockchains themselves &#8212; I do think there will need to be some sort of bridging function or consolidation from these; But for now, at least to see these viable alternatives is really exciting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, the Worldchain example is interesting because these are verifiable humans; so, I just peeked into one of their mini apps and it has something like 600,000 registered users. And so I think we should focus on that&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd at some point, you need then the curation to balance that out. This has been happening for a while with some of our NFTs communities: They have lots and lots of eyeballs that are really excited to dig into other web3 applications. And so, I think we&#8217;ll start to see some of them also acting as these curation marketplaces for things that are built in their ecosystem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. I was just going to ask &#8212; You know, one thing that a company like Apple would argue is that because of the curation that they provide, they are owed some fee on both the purchases or th-the activity that goes on in their app store.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does that square with the \u003Cem\u003Epermissionlessness\u003C\u002Fem\u003E that you see in the crypto arena?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaggie:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I would say at this point, there isn&#8217;t a lot of thoughtful curation. So I would disagree with the first part of that, potentially.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second part of that, the great thing about crypto is that you can then move to another platform.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilar thing, games need quite a bit of capital to launch. And for the past several years, blockchains have acted not just as a platform to build upon, but a publisher as well as a distribution and discovery mechanism. And what I&#8217;ve been seeing is many of these game chains now have their own marketplaces, and they&#8217;re able to feature key games that are built on those blockchains. And that is a key benefit because they are able to take users and move them from game to game.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is the thesis of a lot of our investments; I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;ll be stuck in any one of these decentralized app stores, for example.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love watching all these experiments!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike the Solana phone &#8212; it like breaks every rule, you know: Don&#8217;t compete with Apple on like the iPhone &#8212; and then they&#8217;re just like, screw it, we&#8217;re going to do that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, Toly did a wonderful job on our podcast explaining some of the impetus behind it; and-and the innovation bet that they were making with it, which I think was fantastic.

(I want to be very clear, we&#8217;re not talking about the token, just the network.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaggie:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think Telegram has been one of the exceptions;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I&#8217;ve heard from speaking firsthand to many, many organizations that have large incumbent distribution &#8212; so they might have a platform in Web2, they might actually have something like web3 &#8212; is that- it’s- they still find it hard to bring those users on chain.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne example that you can look at the public data &#8212; Coinbase has something like 100 million verified users that have ever uh transacted Coinbase: If you look at both the active users &#8212; so the daily active monthly, that&#8217;s something like 8 or 10 million transacting. And the number of those users on Base, I think those numbers have just went up recently, they went up from something like 10 million to 18 million.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that&#8217;s still about 10% of their total base. So there&#8217;s this large number of \u003Cem\u003Edormant\u003C\u002Fem\u003E users. And we actually talk about this in our State of Crypto report, which I think is fascinating &#8212; because it&#8217;s absolutely true: You talk to any large &#8212; could be a messaging app, it could be a centralized exchange, anything like this &#8212; And they&#8217;re all trying to figure out: We got them in somehow, they created an account, but they haven&#8217;t done anything more; how can we keep them coming back and transacting onchain?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yup.

There&#8217;s a lot of noise out there… you know, measuring users is very tricky in the crypto world for a number of reasons;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut when we did this market-sizing exercise, we actually found that only 5-10% of people who \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C\u002Fem\u003E crypto are actively \u003Cem\u003Eusing\u003C\u002Fem\u003E crypto. And to me, that stood out as a big gap… But also a really big opportunity for the industry &#8212; given where we&#8217;re at, on the technology timeline with blockchains and the infrastructure getting better; the UX continues to get better. &#8212; And I think we&#8217;re finally ready for primetime.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd given where we&#8217;re at on that curve, I think you know this next year is the perfect time to bring people onchain, convert those passive crypto holders into active crypto users.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E For me, that was a very eye-opening idea, because so many people talk about mainstreaming these new users, and it feels &#8212; not like insurmountable, but it feels like it&#8217;s skipping-a-phase, stage-wise, in the technology readiness and development &#8212; And your idea was like a wonderful bridge to like: Here&#8217;s a way to bring in existing people, convert them into users.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you guys have any theories about what brought them &#8212; I mean, we don&#8217;t know the exact answer, obviously, because we don&#8217;t have that data &#8212; But like, what do you think they did in the first place; and then why they stalled out, before they did something else?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, this is like the perfect time to talk about the price-innovation cycle.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Sure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have this concept, which is this idea that when crypto prices go up, people get interested. And then people that get interested, ultimately decide to build something; the developers come in, they build the products; and those products then kickstart the next wave.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we&#8217;ve seen this happen now many times over the- the history of crypto. And it speaks to the fact that prices are often a leading indicator for the types of activity that we- we want to see. And I think we&#8217;re at the beginning of potentially the next wave.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So sorry, just to be more concrete about it though &#8212; ‘cause I totally agree that&#8217;s a great framework for it &#8212; like, if I were to speculate, a lot of these people that came on, that got wallets might have done it to buy an NFT… Because they saw like Constitution DAO &#8212; remember when all those people were trying to buy the U.S. Constitution? &#8212; I think one of the most exciting things about that is that even though they failed their bid (to win the Constitution), they…it brought a lot of new people into crypto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that&#8217;s probably the only thing they did, and then they didn&#8217;t do anything more with it &#8212; I mean, again, we don&#8217;t know exactly but like that&#8217;s what I would sort of speculate &#8212; and then now they&#8217;re just holding these wallets, but they&#8217;re not active users.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess… the question I have: What do you think would take to get them like to that next thing? Like, what is that gap?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaren:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. Crypto as a technology has a number of different use cases, but it also kind of has these different movements underpinning the technology &#8212; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2024, for example, we saw a lot of progress with crypto as a political movement; we saw key politicians and policymakers speaking very positively about the technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also saw it make incredible developments as a financial movement, right; so Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs were approved, which broadened investor access.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, these are the types of things that ultimately bring a lot of people into the space, make them aware that this is something that they can participate in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAh but where we believe crypto has the most promise is as a computing movement. And Chris Dixon talks a lot about this in his book, Read Write Own: The real power of this technology is to create a, better version of the internet that is more fair uh and open and transparent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think we are, like I said, at the inflection point here: Where we may in 2025 see more developments of crypto as a computing movement. Because, you know we have the people that are in there, right. And with the infrastructure developments we&#8217;ve seen, with fees coming down, with the UX improvements, with new application categories starting to emerge… We, potentially, could see a killer app &#8212; like ChatGPT kind of showed us on the AI side &#8212; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; that really kickstarts the entire industry… Uh and kind of delivers on the promise of crypto as a computing movement, a new internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that&#8217;s what I think I, and a lot of the team, here is-is really excited to watch.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, this is something that we&#8217;ve talked a lot about &#8212; but the fact that stablecoins are, they&#8217;ve found product-market fit &#8212; And, all it really is going to take is one big company to realize that they you know not paying merchant fees on credit card transactions with your customers could be tremendously profitable for them &#8212; like transformative for their bottom line, for these thin-margin businesses –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s gonna take one big company to do that before like this thing takes off. At least, that&#8217;s one pathway where you could see this thing kind of hit the big time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, I&#8217;ll add just that: What I again find very interesting about your idea &#8212; is that notion of bringing adjacent users; and then, and then when we&#8217;re ready, we bring in more of the mainstream users. And we were not ready for that on the UX side anyway…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause when you really think about the \u003Cem\u003Emainstream\u003C\u002Fem\u003E users? I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re going to come through these paths. They&#8217;re going to be &#8212; those interfaces are going to be very abstracted away from them; they might not even know they&#8217;re using crypto. And so it&#8217;s actually really interesting when you think about all these different waves that are going to come in through all these different paths; it&#8217;s very exciting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, Daren.

So, now on to, the next one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, Joachim, to quickly summarize: Your idea was builders will reuse, not just reinvent infrastructure. And your main point you talk about is how it seems like we always see a bespoke validator set, consensus protocol, da da da… And what you say in the post is “the outcomes were sometimes only slightly better in specialized functionality &#8212; but they often lacked in broader or baseline functionality”; That this year you expect to see crypto builders leverage more of the contributions of each other &#8212; like using off-the-shelf infrastructure &#8212; and that it&#8217;ll save them time and effort; but really allow them to really focus on differentiating the value of their product.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich I think is a fantastic big idea; much needed call to action even.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the quick question I have for you, is: Sounds like it&#8217;s great in theory, will it actually happen? And like what do you see as maybe obstacles… of making this happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJoachim:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I think the crucial ingredient for this idea is… whether or not the tech stack keeps changing going forward. &lt;Sonal: Yup&gt; If the hypothesis is correct uh that the tech stack has stabilized or is stabilizing &#8212; and we see certain layers of the tech stack getting well-defined in terms of their interface, and how they interoperate with other layers of the tech stack &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen you would expect that those layers &#8212; there&#8217;s specialized teams, specialized products, specialized services &#8212; working and improving these layers; and that leads to the professionalization of those layers. And you know, then instead of being spread across the stack &#8212; like working on each of these layers simultaneously &#8212; it becomes prudent to basically focus on the pieces of the stack that you can make the most impact on. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the critical question here is: Has the tech stack uh materialized enough, and stabilized enough? If there&#8217;s like a surprising turn, you know around the corner that turns the tech stack upside down; then this may not happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Joachim, so your point about people sort of gravitating toward certain products or services or components that are existing out there… It makes me wonder: When do you know that the tech is actually good enough, to say: Okay, we are going to use this tech; we&#8217;re not going to try to build something new and better than what already exists off the shelf.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a great question; you&#8217;re basically asking how do you know as a builder?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, yeah. Because it&#8217;s nice to say just use something that&#8217;s already out there… But what if you&#8217;re like, but I think I can make something better than that. &lt;chuckles&gt; You know?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJoachim:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. I think advice that I would give that person is to always be aware of the larger ecosystem, and the larger ramifications, and the larger use case or application…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s a wider context that the product or service is going to be used in, than you may perhaps initially think. &lt;Sonal: Yes!&gt; So one can make an analogy with like, a car right:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo maybe you&#8217;re very, very good at like building engines. And your idea is I&#8217;m going to build a new car; you know, I&#8217;m really good at building engines. And that&#8217;s really the one key distinguishing factor.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut your customer will not only want to have like a fantastic engine, right? &#8212; The car also has to have like a reasonable stereo; or the-it has to have like you know reasonable seats; it has to maybe have air conditioning, right &#8212; Are you gonna like reinvent all those parts as well?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr: is there a way for you to focus on the one thing that you&#8217;re very, very good at &#8212; while leveraging best-of-class products that are provided by others &#8212; that provide other parts to the stack.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s fantastic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s a great analogy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a perfect analogy, actually.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E But it’s also- it’s also very apt coming from you, Joachim, because you&#8217;re German; and in Germany, they have all these very, very specialized auto-parts makers &lt;Sonal laughs&gt; that like completely make like the best possible tiny component in the BMW car &lt;Sonal giggles&gt; that like nobody else can top… So it&#8217;s&#8230; it’s also extra.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m just laughing because I can&#8217;t believe you went there, but that&#8217;s a great point. &lt;laughs&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right. It&#8217;s easy to say when you have the best car components around.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;Joachim chuckles&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJoachim, you know, I was joking with you about this big idea that one of my personal observations is that: I think people in crypto have this thing which I call “constraints porn” – That there&#8217;s a lot of people in this early phase of crypto that are just really into it because of the constraints –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think your big idea is going to be very annoying for that crowd, because they actually really like that part of the problem. And in a way, your big idea actually welcomes more new builders to the space &#8212; which is quite democratizing (in my opinion).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJoachim:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I mean, it&#8217;s really an amazing time to build in this space, right, because so many so many code bases that people can tap into when they build their products, or their services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, there&#8217;s really so little you have to genuinely do yourself, right? Like uh you can really focus on what you&#8217;re good at. And for everything else, there&#8217;s highly specialized parts already out there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, probably a good idea to reuse them whenever you can. And tap into the expertise of other teams, of people who build on other parts of the stack.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Thank you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Wonderful; thank you Joachim. And now, we have the last one &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, Chris, you&#8217;ve had a lot of different roles at a16z over the last decade; but in your job, you come across a lot, and you work with, and you&#8217;ve onboarded a lot of, fashion, music, media executives into web3. And so I think your vantage point is not just speaking for yourself, but thousands of the people that you&#8217;ve met with –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, can you tell us, like, your big point for 2025?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Of course, of course.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, my big idea for 2025 &#8212; which has been my big idea for 2024, and 2023, and 2022 &lt;chuckles&gt; &#8212; but I think now we finally are at a state where, you know, we can really make this happen: I call it “hiding the wires”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, what that means is that &#8212; obviously everybody knows the benefits of crypto, and how it&#8217;s gonna be the future of so many different industries; whether it&#8217;s music, whether it&#8217;s fashion, film; the power of ownership, the power of decentralization –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, there&#8217;s a little bit of a- lack of knowledge from people that aren&#8217;t in the crypto industry when we&#8217;re using, you know, technical terms like ZK rollups, or L2s, or gas, or gas fees. And I just have a big PSA to the crypto industry that, We don&#8217;t need to start with the phrase of: hey, this is an “NFT” (project); or hey this is a token; or hey, you know, if you connect your wallet into the-\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike, those are great things for people in the crypto industry. But if you&#8217;re gonna really take something and have it go mainstream, we can&#8217;t lead with the technical terms. Because unfortunately, most people do not know &#8212; nor do they care.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what I mean by “hiding the wires” is: Not necessarily leading with the technical infrastructure, with the technical terms, the technical products &#8212; that obviously are the benefits \u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the application &#8212; but don&#8217;t necessarily need to be the overarching \u003Cem\u003Esell\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love this thesis ‘cause it&#8217;s just like cutting through the jargon… And like okay, we talk about NFTs: What is a non-fungible token? Doesn&#8217;t really matter. What matters is it&#8217;s a way for creators to get paid. &lt;Chris: Exactly&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr like, even somebody at our own company the other day was like, why do I need a stablecoin? But like, what if he didn&#8217;t call it a stablecoin &#8212; and it was just a way to save like 50 bucks over the course of a year on coffees that you&#8217;re buying, you know? &lt;Chris: Exactly!&gt; All of a sudden it&#8217;s like, oh, whatever it&#8217;s called, I don&#8217;t know; I want it, because it makes sense.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I want it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I can&#8217;t believe we didn&#8217;t have this beforehand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E You know, I came from the music industry. And… When I used to go to conferences, nobody ever went to an “MP3” conference, you know. Like why are we starting conferences in using technical terms in order to try and attract mainstream users into the space? But we&#8217;re very happy to put an NFT conference on a billboard at any moment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA great example is the SMTP, right? Like that&#8217;s actually like a extremely technical protocol &#8212; you know where anybody could build on top of it &#8212; But through apps like Gmail, and Superhuman, and YahooMail, and all these things, made it extremely simple for people to utilize and get the benefits of SMTP software.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I&#8217;m sending emails and blasting back and forth, and crushing through my day, I&#8217;m not thinking “oh, wow, like, this SMTP software is working perfectly”; I&#8217;m just doing what I have to do. And because of that, I&#8217;m getting the benefits of the technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think the same thing really needs to happen when it comes to crypto &#8212; where there&#8217;s so much benefits: I mean, you think about decentralization; you think about you know, ownership; you think about knowing your customers, and disrupting middlemen, and you know being able to have direct commun-&#8230;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean, my hope is that for next year: If we can have more businesses and more companies that are thinking that intuitively for the customer and for the everyday people, it&#8217;s going to get us creating new industries… And re-imagining how the future of creatives; how the future of small\u002F medium businesses; the future of restaurants, you name it &#8212; will all be able to leverage the benefits of crypto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And interestingly enough, all those people you cited \u003Cem\u003E&#8212;\u003C\u002Fem\u003E creators, the small businesses, etc. &#8212; are the ones that would benefit the most from the features of crypto… But to your point, they&#8217;re not able to directly access it. Yet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChris:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Exactly! And it&#8217;s not their fault; it&#8217;s not their job to understand how to swap tokens, or to you know have different wallets that go off to different chains. Like they just want to be able to get access to the benefits.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why we&#8217;re all working in this space; and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m most excited about.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s perfect. And a great note to end on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;transition music&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, why don&#8217;t we start by just riffing off what we see are the kind of cross-cutting themes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, I think this year I noticed three broad categories of topics &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; that people brought up for their big ideas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst section was having to do with AI &#8212; and the intersection of AI and crypto, which is no surprise; &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; it&#8217;s been just a total, you know, momentous year for AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second bucket I would describe as&#8230; You know, we like to talk about digi fizzy here.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oh, god, I hate that phrase, but yes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I know! It&#8217;s a rough word. But this kind of coming together of the digital and physical worlds&#8230; &lt;Sonal: Oh, interesting&gt; &#8230;in a sort of practical way. &lt;mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, you know, that&#8217;s everything from payments, to voting, to kind of creating networks for physical infrastructure… So maybe AI is like the software side, maybe this is more of like the hardware- or the hardware of like reality, and life, and living.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E By the way, on that second theme, that&#8217;s so interesting because I would never have categorized it that way &#8212; but now that you say that, I see exactly what you mean: Because there&#8217;s an example of, like&#8230;there&#8217;s examples of tokenizing things in the physical world, tokeniz- putting bonds on chain. …I mean, one of the examples is even using your own physical body and biometric data, and tokenizing that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you&#8217;re right! That is interesting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right. I mean, how much more physical can you get?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. We can&#8230; I wish I could cut you saying “digi fizzy”, but hey, &lt;Robert chuckles&gt; uh I&#8217;ll take it because that is what&#8230; By the way, where do you stand on digi fizzy versus phygital?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E They&#8217;re both terrible words.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E They&#8217;re really awful. “Phygital” to me is far worse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I&#8217;m holding out for something better.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes, me too. We&#8217;ll have to coin something. Anyway. Yeah, and that&#8217;s cool. I didn&#8217;t see it that way, but I agree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat&#8217;s the third thing you see?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And then maybe I&#8217;d rank the third category as just like generally the tech improving &#8212; Like, kind of taking what has happened over the past year, and just sort of incrementing it up: What will happen if everything gets a little bit better, a little bit easier to use, a little bit more smooth and seamless. &lt;Sonal: Yeah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd just kind of… yah. So I feel like those are the three kind of categories that I was detecting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E On the last one, I thought of that more as just really significantly improved user experience &#8212; and a little bit more of a maturing of an industry that&#8217;s-that’s more ready to think about the people first versus the technology first. &lt;Robert: mm&gt; That&#8217;s how I categorize that last theme.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo for instance, like Jochem talks about how, you know, people don&#8217;t have to design everything from scratch &#8212; you can actually build things and use off the shelf components and repurpose them. Chris Lyons talks about the other extreme: Which is, hey, you may not even know you&#8217;re using it as crypto. And then Mason talked about how like &#8212; just as a mindset shift cutting across both of these &#8212; that people will start with thinking of what they&#8217;re trying to solve for, and then the technology will follow. Versus the other way around, which seems like how the industry has led. And I think it&#8217;s exactly because of the improvements that you&#8217;re describing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere would you put Maggie&#8217;s discovery one on this list, like, app stores.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s such a good one. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; I would rank that one as kind of a crossover between the second bucket and third bucket: The second being this kind of merging of the digital and physical. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, she has this nice point she makes about how we&#8217;re seeing some crypto hardware &#8212; like World App&#8217;s Orb; and uh Solana&#8217;s mobile phone &#8212; kind of leading to these app-store experiences that would sort of kind of &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to say mimic, but would at least echo &#8212; the way that previous generations of the web kind of hit it big.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Like the iPhone and its App Store.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The iPhone and the app&#8230; Exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, yah exactly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that&#8217;s interesting because I would agree &#8212; but I would maybe put a twist on Maggie&#8217;s, where it&#8217;s actually kind of an interesting contradiction too: Because on one hand we&#8217;re saying, hey, crypto could be very poised for the mainstream or even the &#8212; as Daren would argue, the \u003Cem\u003Eadjacent\u003C\u002Fem\u003E mainstream (which is the people who are already wallet owners, but not users) &#8212; But in Maggie&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s also very interesting because she&#8217;s also talking about crypto having its own area, and like having its own App Store essentially.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut you know, as we&#8217;ve seen with like recent discussions around debanking and-and other things, like a lot of these App Stores were kicking crypto out, and not ready for it yet; &lt;Robert: yah&gt; And obviously, their positions have changed &#8212; like, Coinbase just announced that Apple Wallet integration &#8212; But there&#8217;s enough crypto apps that crypto can have its own App Store, which is very interesting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah; debanking has become this like big topic of conversation &#8212; this issue of crypto businesses, startups, and also people kind of losing access to the financial system unfairly; and without any explanation or justification as to why &#8212; And we see something similar from the tech perspective, where you have deplatforming.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you mentioned this with the App Stores, you know, when an app doesn&#8217;t get greenlit for an App Store or it gets removed inexplicably.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And by the way, for arguably similar reasons &#8212; because as you saw in our debanking explainer, sometimes it&#8217;s very justifiable; like, a bank is allowed to &#8212; And sometimes the App Stores will argue it&#8217;s for security reasons, or some other quote-&#8220;good&#8221; reason. And oftentimes it might be… But a lot of times you&#8217;re like, huh, not really.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERobert:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. And so I see &#8212; like, part of that third bucket I was describing, of like things getting a little bit better? I think you could also describe it as kind of like crypto holding its own&#8230;as its own kind of platform.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, you know, Miles&#8217;&#8230;his big idea, he talks about how you know this piece of legislation that Wyoming recently passed &#8212; the DUNA, the Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association &#8212; It recognizes these communities as legal entities to operate protocols. &lt;Sonal: That’s great&gt; and to operate crypto startups in a decentralized manner, &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; for the first time. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is a platform that, like, didn&#8217;t exist before… People were kind of just flying the plane and kind of; you know, whatever, the tech works. But it didn&#8217;t have an exact spot to fit in the legal framework.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right! Well, a lot like Maggie&#8217;s point &#8212; where it&#8217;s a little bit like crypto, the DAOs (the decentralized autonomous organizations) need their own legal entity structure that&#8217;s not only an LLC… but something, you know, just like we have a corporation, an LLC, and this is like a version that&#8217;s that works for decentralized autonomous communities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat&#8217;s a very good point.

There is a large group of blockchain users and others whose main access to the internet is through their smartphones, but which relies on centralized infrastructure — which is convenient, but also risky. Users have traditionally solved this problem by running their own nodes — a time- and resource-intensive endeavor that, at the very least, requires a constantly-online machine, hundreds of gigabytes of storage, and around a day to sync from scratch… not to mention special skills.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut more people are now starting to care about decentralizing access to blockchains for\u003Ci data-stringify-type=\"italic\"\u003E all\u003C\u002Fi\u003E users — even those who cannot run a node themselves.

I’m hoping to see similar trust and decentralization improvements in other parts of the stack, such as event indexing and user data storage.
