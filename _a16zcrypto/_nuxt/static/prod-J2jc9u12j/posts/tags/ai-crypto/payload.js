There is a large group of blockchain users and others whose main access to the internet is through their smartphones, but which relies on centralized infrastructure — which is convenient, but also risky. Users have traditionally solved this problem by running their own nodes — a time- and resource-intensive endeavor that, at the very least, requires a constantly-online machine, hundreds of gigabytes of storage, and around a day to sync from scratch… not to mention special skills.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut more people are now starting to care about decentralizing access to blockchains for\u003Ci data-stringify-type=\"italic\"\u003E all\u003C\u002Fi\u003E users — even those who cannot run a node themselves.

I’m hoping to see similar trust and decentralization improvements in other parts of the stack, such as event indexing and user data storage.

Bueno de Mesquita (University of Chicago) considers a model of the effects of competition from AI on production and innovation by content creators — introducing prices, which are often ignored, into the analysis. Human producers create content that is both sold directly to consumers and used as training data for AI. The AI generates a substitute good for human-generated content at zero marginal cost; the more training data the AI has access to, the higher quality the AI-generated content. The higher the quality of AI-generated content, the more consumers substitute away from human generated content, the lower the market price of human-generated content, the less human-generated content is produced, and the lower the profits to the human producers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEthan shows that, despite the fact that AI crowds out human production, because of price adjustments, exogenous improvements in the ability of AI to translate data into high-quality content, can benefit consumers. He also explores the effects of improvements in AI on innovation by human producers. He captures this by allowing for the possibility that human producers can pay a fixed cost to create a new product for which there is not any pre-existing training data, showing that exogenous improvements in AI can have non-monotone effects on the amount of innovation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"AI and innovation with Ethan Bueno de Mesquita | a16z crypto research talks\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FWZLFtoifCLA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout the presenter \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEthan is the Dean and Sydney Stein Professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.

Sometimes the government may regulate away the intermediaries’ most outrageous behaviors or become a benevolent (but inefficient) intermediary. Sometimes technology surprises us all with something much better: interoperability.

Because the internet was built on open and interoperable protocols, it was a strong decentralizing force, and decreased the power of intermediaries across a range of industries. But it also created the conditions for new and more powerful intermediaries to emerge — from marketplaces and payments, to messaging and social media, the creator economy, and so on. Propelled by the need to monetize the fast-growing networks they created, internet-based intermediaries proceeded to limit interoperability and constrained consumers and businesses within their walled gardens.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EToday, those garden walls define how businesses surface products to their customers, how developers distribute their apps, how we interact with our social network, how creators connect to their audiences, and a lot more. By controlling not only access but also the underlying data and the algorithms that rank results and match buyers and sellers, each one of these platforms shapes how society allocates attention, effort, and money. Without a change in direction, AI will only make this worse, since it builds on the advantage these companies have established across data, compute, and distribution channels.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EInteroperability fixes this. Imagine a world where you can send and receive messages irrespective of the messaging app you use. Same with sending and receiving money, reading updates from your social or news feed, finding the right product or service, or interacting with an AI agent. On a truly interoperable network, consumers and businesses have actual leverage against intermediaries because they can port their business elsewhere without having to rebuild their audience, social graph, or customer base.

Why does the market keep repeating these cycles &#8212; instead of supporting the more productive blockchain-based innovations that will truly make a difference?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMemecoins are crypto tokens used mostly for humor, born of joining an online community that’s in on the joke. You’ve likely heard of Dogecoin, based on the old \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fknowyourmeme.com\u002Fmemes\u002Fdoge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Edoge\u003C\u002Fa\u003E meme featuring images of Shiba Inu dogs.

This kind of “memecoin” embodies various facets of internet culture and is mostly harmless, while other memecoins \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bloomberg.com\u002Fnews\u002Farticles\u002F2024-03-13\u002Fmemecoin-trading-volume-rises-to-levels-last-seen-before-crypto-bubble-burst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eare not\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut my goal here isn’t to defend or to diminish memecoins. It’s to point out the backwardness of a policy regime that lets memecoins thrive &#8212; while crypto companies and blockchain tokens with more productive use cases face hurdles. Any mememaker can easily create, launch, and even automatically list tokens, including tokens that derogate specific politicians and celebrities. But entrepreneurs trying to build something real and lasting? They get stuck in regulatory purgatory.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s actually safer to release a memecoin today with \u003Cem\u003Eno \u003C\u002Fem\u003Euse case, than it is to launch a token that’s \u003Cem\u003Euseful\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Think about it this way: We’d consider it a policy failure if we had a securities market that incentivized only GameStop \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftime.com\u002F6312307\u002Fgamestop-meme-stocks-dumb-money\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ememe stocks\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, but that rejected the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA &#8212; all companies with products people use daily. Yet current regulations encourage platforms to list memecoins and not other, more useful tokens. The lack of regulatory clarity in the crypto industry means platforms and entrepreneurs live under constant fear that the more productive blockchain token they are listing or developing could suddenly be deemed a security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI call the distinction between these more speculative and productive use cases in the crypto industry the “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fblockchain-culture-computer-vs-casino\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecomputer vs. the casino\u003C\u002Fa\u003E”. One culture (“the casino”) sees blockchains as a way to launch tokens primarily for trading and gambling. The other culture (“the computer”) is more interested in blockchains as a new platform for innovation, much like web, social, and mobile were before it. It is possible that a memecoin community could \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002Fdp2gbWsPFgY?si=wSa8kKQiNmqw-i2r&amp;t=43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eevolve\u003C\u002Fa\u003E its token by adding more utility over time; after all, many disruptive innovations we use today once started out looking like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcdixon.org\u002F2010\u002F01\u002F03\u002Fthe-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ea toy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. “Utility” matters because at its core, a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Ftokens-are-a-new-digital-primitive\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etoken is\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a new digital primitive that offer property rights online for anyone.

They could verify proof of authenticity to protect against deepfakes. They could allow more voice in, or the ability to exit, from a particular social network &#8212; especially if you don’t like the moderation policies or who those networks kick off and keep on. They could give users a vote in a platform’s decisions, especially if those users’ livelihoods are dependent on that platform. They could mark “proof of humanity” against artificial intelligence. Or they could just generally serve as a decentralizing counterbalance to the centralizing power of enterprises.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOur legal frameworks should be encouraging these kinds of innovations. So why are we prioritizing memes over matter? U.S. securities laws don’t empower the SEC to make merit-based judgments about an investment. Nor is it the SEC’s job to end speculation altogether. Instead, the agency’s role is to (1) protect investors; (2) maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and (3) facilitate capital formation. The SEC is failing across all three of these objectives when it comes to digital asset markets and tokens.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe primary test the SEC uses to determine whether or not something is a security is the 1946 \u003Cem\u003EHowey \u003C\u002Fem\u003Etest, which involves assessing a number of factors &#8212; including whether there is a \u003Cem\u003Ereasonable expectation of profits due to the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fcorpfin\u002Fframework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Emanagerial efforts\u003C\u002Fa\u003E of others\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Take for example Bitcoin and Ethereum: While both crypto projects began with the vision of a single person, they evolved into communities of developers with no one entity in control &#8212; so potential investors don’t have to rely on anyone’s “managerial efforts”. These technologies now function like public infrastructure rather than as proprietary platforms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, other entrepreneurs building innovative projects don’t know how to qualify for the same regulatory treatment as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin (founded in 2009) and Ethereum (2013-2014) are the only significant blockchain projects to date &#8212; both established over a decade ago &#8212; that the SEC has deemed, explicitly or implicitly, as not involving managerial efforts. The SEC’s lack of candor and approach &#8212; including applying the Howey test through regulation-by-enforcement &#8212; has also led to much confusion and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fits-time-to-move-crypto-from-chaos-to-order\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Euncertainty\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in the industry. And while the Howey test is well reasoned, it is inherently subjective. The SEC has so broadly stretched the test’s meaning that ordinary assets, even something like Nike shoes, could be considered securities today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMemecoin projects, meanwhile, don’t have developers, so there’s no pretense of memecoin investors relying on the “managerial efforts” of anyone. Memecoins thus propagate, while innovative projects struggle. Investors end up facing more risk, not less.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer isn’t less regulation &#8212; it’s \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C\u002Fem\u003E regulation. Specific solutions include adding well-tailored disclosures to provide regular investors with more information. Another solution is requiring long lockup periods to prevent get-rich-quick schemes, and incentivize more long-term building.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERegulators implemented similar protections following the Great Depression, after the excesses of the roaring 1920’s and stock market crash of 1929. Once those guiderails were in place, we saw an unprecedented era of growth and innovation in our markets and economy. It’s time for regulators to learn from the mistakes of the past, and pave the way towards a better future for all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe author is general partner at

early internet was a magical place because it was driven by people and their creativity. Builders knew that whatever they made, they owned — a simple promise that established the right incentives for the technology to flourish. But now, the internet is stagnating and it’s harder than ever for new apps to break through.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider the app stores: almost all the products that consistently appear on leader lists were founded more than a decade ago: Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), Twitter, now known as X (2006), WhatsApp (2009), Uber (2009), Instagram (2010), Snap (2011) and even Tiktok’s parent ByteDance (2012).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBig Tech consolidated its control of the internet around 2010. Just a few gatekeepers now determine who or what will succeed online. Restoring a vibrant internet means breaking this power and putting users back in the driver’s seat. The key to doing that is creating new networks that cannot be easily usurped — ideally, those \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fread-write-own-intro\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebuilt on blockchains\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly internet networks, like the web and email, provided a stable foundation upon which people could build businesses and establish a direct connection to their audience. This is no longer the case: networks controlled by the largest tech companies now reach billions, but entrepreneurs and creators have learned just how untrustworthy they can be. These businesses clamp down on application programming interfaces, meddle with mysterious algorithms, and rank content according to opaque and capricious policies. Worse, big tech companies claim most of the revenue that flows through their networks. This stifles creativity, making our online lives poorer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the economics of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Ftags\u002Fnetwork-effects\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enetwork effects\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: companies provide perks and easy-to-use tools to draw in users — and then, once they are locked in, switch to extracting value from them. A corporate network that doesn’t make this switch will be outcompeted by one that does. It’s impossible to quantify how much innovation and consumer choice has been lost as a result.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome clamor for regulation — though this risks cementing existing power structures. Others focus on reviving early internet protocols, such as plans for so-called federated networks (in which policies are enforced by a central framework), though these are not widely used.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA revitalized internet would require three properties. First, openness: being available to anyone, anywhere. Second, trust: the rules should be transparent, fair and dependable, so builders, creators and users know the network cannot yank the rug out from under them. Finally, all users — not just centralized gatekeepers — should have a say in the networks they contribute to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworks built on blockchains have all these attributes. While it’s easy to dismiss the technology because of its associations with casino-style gambling behavior — notably FTX and meme coins — it would be a mistake to ignore its potential. Progress towards greater scalability indicates this could be as transformative as the arrival of the PC.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains are a new class of virtual computer that can, for the first time ever, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eestablish inviolable rules in software\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Usually, whoever controls computer hardware can tell the software what to do. But blockchains invert this relationship, preventing those who control a centralized server from arbitrarily changing rules. Unlike traditional computers, blockchains can ensure that any code they run will continue to operate as designed. This could potentially revolutionize the internet’s power dynamics.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworks built on blockchains combine the societal benefits of early internet protocol networks (open access, democratic governance, low take rates and user ownership rights) with the competitive advantages of corporate ones (sustainable sources of funding and advanced features). This provides the path to a freer and more vibrant internet that will reward us all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis op-ed originally appeared as “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ft.com\u002Fcontent\u002F775a9133-1367-42ed-b1a7-ba10b31229c8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EBig tech killed the internet — blockchain can help revive it\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” on the \u003C\u002Fem\u003EFinancial Times’s \u003Cem\u003Ewebsite on Thursday, February 1, 2024, and in the newspaper&#8217;s print edition on Friday, February 2, 2024.

Or change it in whichever way you want; or shut it down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so that&#8217;s kind of an interesting vision for long-running AIs that are continually evolving and continually becoming better: It&#8217;d be better if it were the case that they weren&#8217;t just controlled by a single centralized company.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course: it&#8217;s a very science fiction idea, because there are lots of problems – including the problems of verification; and the problems of keeping data private using cryptography and still being able to compute on top of that data, maybe with fully homomorphic encryption. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; All of these problems continue to be outstanding, but it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s inconceivable.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Wow; I love Ali&#8217;s vision there!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I love it too, especially given that quote (I think it was Asimov?) that today&#8217;s science fiction is tomorrow&#8217;s science fact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAli, I know you have a meta-framework for thinking about all this stuff that I’ve heard you share  before, can you share that now too.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, there is this broader narrative that has existed for quite some time now that&#8217;s only becoming much more accentuated now with the development of things like LLMs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Actually define that really quick Ali just for listeners who aren’t already familiar, just as context.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So LLM stands for “large language model” and it uses some of the technology that was developed at Google back in 2017 – there&#8217;s this famous paper known as &#8220;Attention is All You Need” (that was the title of the paper)and it outlined what are now known as transformers – and that&#8217;s the basis, basically, of some of the new models that people have been training these days, including ChatGPT and so on, all of these are large language models or LLMs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&lt;Sonal: mmm!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was that famous, I think (2018) line from Peter Thiel that “AI is communist and crypto is libertarian”&#8230; That line is like very on point, actually, because AI and crypto in many ways are natural counterweights for one another. &lt;Sonal: uh huh?&gt; And maybe we can go deep over the course of the podcast into each one of these as we go through examples, &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; – but \u003Cspan style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"\u003Et\u003C\u002Fspan\u003Ehere are four major ways in which that&#8217;s true:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[1] The first is that AI is very much a technology that thrives and enables top-down centralized control, whereas crypto is a technology that&#8217;s all about bottom-up decentralized cooperation. And in many ways, actually, you can think of crypto as the study of building systems that are decentralized, that enable large-scale cooperation of humans – where there isn&#8217;t really any central point of control.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so that&#8217;s one natural way in which these two technologies are counterweights for one another.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[2] Another one is: that AI is a sustaining innovation in that it reinforces the business models of existing technology companies &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; because it helps them make top-down decisions. And the best example of this would be Google being able to decide exactly what ad to display for each of their users across billions of users and billions of page views.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas crypto is actually a fundamentally disruptive innovation, in that it has a business model that&#8217;s fundamentally at odds with the business models of big tech companies. And so as a result, it&#8217;s a movement that is spearheaded by rebels\u002F by the fringes – as opposed to being led by the incumbents. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; So that&#8217;s the second.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[3] The third one is that AI will probably relate and interplay a lot with all of the trends towards privacy… Because AI as a technology has built in all sorts of incentives that move us towards less individual privacy – because we will have companies that want access to all of our data; and AI models that are trained on more and more data will become more and more effective. And so I think that that leads us down a path of the AI panopticon, where there&#8217;s just collective aggregation of everyone&#8217;s data into the training of these enormous models in order to make these models as good as possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas crypto moves us towards the opposite direction, which is a direction of increasing individual privacy. It&#8217;s a direction of increasing sovereignty, &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; where users have control over their own data. And those two trends, I think, will be very important. And this is just another important way in which crypto is the counterweight, for AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E(4) And maybe the final one has to do with this latest trend in AI – the fact that AI is now very clearly a powerful technology for generating new art; it&#8217;s now a creative tool &lt;Sonal: mm! totally&gt; – that will lead us to infinite abundance of media, infinite creativity in many ways.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd crypto is a counterweight to that because it helps us cut through all of the abundance, in helping us distinguish what&#8217;s created by humans versus what&#8217;s created by AI. And cryptography will be an essential part of maintaining and preserving what actually is human in a world where 1000x more of the content &lt;Sonal: right&gt; is actually artificially generated.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo these are all things that we can talk about, but I think that there is this important meta-narrative; and these two technologies are very much diametrically opposing, in many respects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So maybe Ali, to add to that – this is a wonderful summary – and I would say also that there&#8217;s also a lot of areas, where techniques from AI are having an impact in blockchains; and vice versa, &lt;mhm&gt; where techniques from blockchains are having an impact in AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI&#8217;ll give a brief answer here because we&#8217;re going to dive into the details in just a minute; but there are many points of intersection: I guess we&#8217;ll talk about applications of zero knowledge for machine learning in just a minute…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut I also want to touch on all these applications where machine learning itself can be used to write code. So for example, machine learning can be used to write Solidity code that goes into contract. It can be used to find maybe errors in codes and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s points of intersection where machine learning can be used to generate deep fakes and blockchains can actually help to protect against uh deep fakes. And so I guess we&#8217;re going to touch on all these points – but, the interesting thing is that there&#8217;s really quite a lot of intersection between blockchains and machine learning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, before we dive into those – one question I have for you Dan, is do you agree with that? I mean I definitely hear Ali&#8217;s point that AI and crypto are very natural complements actually, or counterweights really for each other, or they can be different forces that can kind of check and balance each other almost… But, is this an inherent quality to AI and crypto in your opinion? Or is this just an artifact of the way things are done right now; what parts might you agree or disagree with?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah; so I would say that, if you look at it from far away… the techniques that are used in AI, they seem \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C\u002Fem\u003E different from the techniques that are used in blockchains, right? So blockchains is about cryptography, decentralization, finance, and economics and so on;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas AI is you know about statistics, the mathematics of machine learning and so on; it&#8217;s about big data. The techniques actually look quite different. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; but they&#8217;re actually a lot of places where one side can help the other  &lt;mhm&gt; and vice versa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo maybe the first one to start with is kind of the obvious one that&#8217;s been on a lot of people&#8217;s minds, which is what&#8217;s called the applications of \u003Cstrong\u003Ezero knowledge for machine learning\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E;  this is kind of an emerging area, it&#8217;s called \u003Cstrong\u003EzkML\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. And the reason this has become interesting is because ZK techniques have improved dramatically – because of their application in blockchains.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat&#8217;s happened over the last 10 years is sort of unbelievable; you know, something that we don&#8217;t see very often: This idea of zero knowledge proofs, and proof systems in general, they were considered very theoretical a decade ago. And because of all of their applications in blockchains, all of a sudden there was a lot of effort in making them more practical and real world. And as a result, there&#8217;s been tremendous progress (as our listeners know), that now these things are actually deployed, and used to protect real systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, the question then is, can zero knowledge techniques be used to help machine learning? And there are a couple of examples – honestly, we could spend the whole podcast just on zkML – but maybe I can just give a taste, one or two examples where ZK is useful for machine learning;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so imagine Alice has a secret model that she spent a lot of time training and that model is actually very important to her. It&#8217;s very important that people don&#8217;t know how the model works. But she still wants to be able to service requests from Bob, right: So Bob would like to send her some data, she would apply the model to the data, send the result back to Bob.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBob has no idea whether he&#8217;s getting the correct results on the model, right? Maybe he paid for a certain model, and you want to make sure that Alice is really using that model, right; maybe he paid for GPT-4 and he wants to make sure Alice is really using GPT-4, and not GPT-3.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell it turns out ZK techniques can help here a lot. So what Alice would do, she would commit to her model, make the commitment publicly available. And then whenever Bob submits a piece of data, Alice could run the model on that data, sends the results back to Bob – along with the proof that the model was evaluated correctly. So Bob now would have a guarantee that in fact the model that was committed to IS the one that was run on Bob&#8217;s data. Yeah? So that&#8217;s an example where ZK techniques can be useful in the ML case.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I want to kind of stress why this is so important: &lt;Sonal: Yah!&gt; So let&#8217;s look at one example –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo suppose we have a function, a model that&#8217;s actually used to affect people&#8217;s lives. Like imagine, you know, maybe we use a model to decide whether we grant a loan, or grant a mortgage; you know a financial institution might want to use a model like that. Well, you want to make sure that the same model as being applied to everyone, right – that it&#8217;s not the case that, you know, one model is being applied to me &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; and a different model is being applied to you &lt;Sonal: right&gt;. Well, by basically having the bank commit to the model, right; and then everyone can verify that their data is being assessed by the same committed model &lt;mmm&gt; – we can make sure that the same model is being applied to everyone.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have to say that there&#8217;s a wonderful open problem here: Which is, that even though zero knowledge techniques can make sure that the same model is being applied to everyone, there is this question you know: Is the model fair? Models can have biases, could lead to unfair results. And so, there&#8217;s a whole area of research – it&#8217;s called algorithmic fairness; there are many, many papers on algorithmic fairness – and it&#8217;s really interesting to ask: Well now that we have a committed model, can we prove in zero knowledge that the model satisfies some fairness definition from the area of algorithmic fairness.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, like how do we make sure that the training process ran correctly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, everything that you said about ZKML is extremely exciting. And as a technology I think it&#8217;ll play a role at making machine learning, and AI sort of generally, more transparent and more trustworthy – both within the context of crypto and outside of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think an even crazier, and maybe longer-term, and more ambitious, application of ZKML – and some of the other verification techniques that the crypto community has been working on &lt;mhm&gt; – is just generally decentralizing AI. Because as we were talking about before, AI is a technology that is almost, inherently centralizing – in that it very much thrives from things like scale effects, because having things within a datacenter makes things more efficient – and so scaling things in a centralized way makes for things to become more powerful, and more centralized as a result.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen also, data is usually controlled by a small number of tech companies in the middle. And, as a result also kind of leads to additional centralization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then finally: machine learning models, and machine learning talent, also kind of controlled by a small number of players.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so crypto can again help on this front by building technology using things like ZKML that can help us decentralize AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there are three main things that go into AI: There&#8217;s the \u003Cstrong\u003Ecompute\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E aspect, and that requires sort of large scale use of GPUs (usually in data centers). There&#8217;s the \u003Cstrong\u003Edata\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E piece, which, again, most of the centralized companies control. And then there&#8217;s the machine learning \u003Cstrong\u003Emodels\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E themselves. &lt;Sonal: yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the easiest one might be the prong of compute. Like can you actually decentralize the compute for the training and the inference of machine learning models? And this is where some of the techniques that Dan was talking about – things like zero knowledge proofs that you can use to prove that the process of actually conducting inference, or, training a model was actually done correctly – so that you can outsource that process to a large community. And you can have a distributed process by which anyone who has a GPU can contribute computation to the network, and have a model be trained in that way – without necessarily having to rely on a massive data center with all of the GPUs in a centralized manner.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd there&#8217;s a big question still of whether or not that economically ends up making sense… But at the very least, through the right incentives, you can actually tap into the long tail: You can tap into all of the idle GPU capacity that might exist; have all of those people contribute that computation to the training of a model, or to the running of inference; and provide an alternative to what otherwise would be just the big tech companies in the middle that currently control everything. &lt;Sonal: mmmm!&gt; There are all sorts of important technical problems that would have to be solved in order for that to be possible –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s actually a company in the space that is called Gensyn which is building exactly this. They are building a decentralized marketplace for GPU compute. Very much for the purpose of training machine learning models. And it&#8217;s a marketplace where anyone could contribute their GPU compute – whether it be in their kind of personal computer under their desk, or whether it be idle inside of some data center.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then on the other side, anyone can leverage whatever compute exists in the network to train their large machine learning models. And this would be an alternative to the very centralized, sort of OpenAI \u002F Google \u002F Meta \u002F all – you know, insert your favorite big tech company here &lt;Sonal: yah! chuckles&gt; – alternative that currently you would necessarily have to go with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, before we go into more of this decentralization framework – cuz Ali, you were breaking down compute, and I think you were going to share the other two of those three prongs – But before we do&#8230;both of you guys talked a little bit about all the technical challenges here. So what are some of the technical challenges that need to be overcome here, and that people may or may not already be solving? (I definitely want builders who listen to this episode to also think about what the opportunities are in this space, and where they can address existing challenges; or what are some of the challenges they&#8217;re going to face in building solutions here.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, so maybe I can mention two that I think would be interesting to folks –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[1] So one is basically, uh-imagine you have a situation where Alice actually has a model that she wants to protect. She wants to send the model in an encrypted form to some other party, let&#8217;s say to Bob. So Bob receives an encrypted model, and it needs to be able to run its data on this encrypted model.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell how do you do that? If you have a piece of data that you want to run on a model, but you only have the encryption of the model, how do you make that possible?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is something that we would use what&#8217;s called fully homomorphic encryption for. &lt;Sonal: Yah. (FHE).&gt; It’s a- fully homomorphic encryption is this remarkable tool that allows you to compute on encrypted data.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is kind of mind-boggling that this is possible – but you can have an encrypted model, and you might have some clear text data, and you can actually run the encrypted model on the clear text data and receive and obtain an encrypted result. You would send the encrypted result back to Alice, and she would be able to decrypt and see the results in the clear.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this is actually something that&#8217;s already- there&#8217;s actually quite a bit of demand for this in practice; &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; it doesn&#8217;t take much effort to see that the DoD is interested in this. There are many other applications where you can send an encrypted model to a third party; the third party would run the encrypted model on their data; sends you back the results; you can decrypt, and learn something about the data that was given as input to the encrypted model.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question of course, is how do we scale that up? Right now this works well for medium-sized models… and the question is, can we scale it up to much larger models? So this is quite a challenge: a couple of startups in the space, and again, very very interesting technology, it&#8217;s kind of amazing that this is possible at all. &lt;Sonal: yah… really&gt; And we&#8217;re probably going to see much more of that in the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[2] The other area is actually what Ali mentioned, another very important area, which is: how do we know that the model was trained correctly?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if I send my data to someone and I asked him to train a model on that data, maybe fine tune the model on that data – how do I know that they did that correctly? Right, they might send me a model back, but how do I know that the model doesn&#8217;t have backdoors in it. There&#8217;s actually a fair amount of work on showing that if the training is done incorrectly, it could send you back a model that would work correctly on all your test data – but it has a backdoor, meaning that it would fail catastrophically on one particular input. This is possible if your training process is not verified.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, this is an area where ZKML comes in: We can prove to you that the training ran correctly; or maybe there&#8217;s some other techniques that might be possible, to prove that the training was done correctly. But again, this is another area – a very active area of research – and I would encourage many of the listeners, this is like a very very difficult problem: proving that training was done correctly; proving that the training data even was collected correctly, and was filtered correctly, and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that actually is a wonderful area to get into if people are looking to do more work in the space.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Fantastic! Ali, is there anything you would add to that?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, definitely. Well I guess if we continue down the path of talking about what it would take to help decentralize the AI stack, I think that in order to decentralize the compute prong – and there are the three important prongs – if we wanted to decentralize the compute aspect, there are two very important, open technical challenges –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first is the problem of verification (which Dan just mentioned) &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; which you could use ZKML for. And you can ideally over time use zero-knowledge proofs to prove that the actual work – that the people who are contributing to this network – was actually done correctly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the challenge there is that the performance of these cryptographic primitives is nowhere near where it needs to be to be able to do either training or inference of the very very large models. So the models today, like sort of the LLMs that we all kind of know and love now (like ChatGPT), would not be provable using the current state-of-the-art of ZKML. And so there&#8217;s a lot of work that&#8217;s being done towards improving the performance of the proving process, so that you can prove larger and larger workloads efficiently. But that&#8217;s an open problem, and something &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; that a lot of people are working on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the meantime, companies like Gensyn are using other techniques that are not just cryptographic – and instead are game-theoretic in nature, where they just get a larger number of people who are independent from one another to do the work; and \u003Cem\u003Ecompare\u003C\u002Fem\u003E their work with one another, to make sure that the work&#8217;s done correctly. &lt;Sonal: Ohhh… interesting.&gt; That is more of a game-theoretic\u002F optimistic approach that is not relying on cryptography, but is still aligned with this greater goal of decentralizing AI – or helping create an ecosystem for AI that is much more organic, community-owned, and bottom-up – as opposed to the top-down that&#8217;s being sort of put forth by companies like OpenAI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that&#8217;s the first problem; the first big problem is the problem of verification.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the second big one is the problem of distributed systems: Like how do you actually coordinate a large community of people who are contributing GPUs to a network &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; such that it all feels like an integrated, unified substrate for computation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd there will be lots of interesting challenges along the lines of: We&#8217;re breaking up that machine learning workload, in a way that makes sense; and shipping off different pieces of it to different nodes in the network; figuring out how to do all of that efficiently; and then also when nodes fail, figure out how to recover, and assign new nodes to then take over (whatever work was being done by the node that failed). So there are lots of messy details at a distributed-systems level that companies will have to solve – in order to give us this decentralized network that can perform machine learning workloads in a way that&#8217;s perhaps even cheaper than just using the cloud.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah… That&#8217;s great.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E …Yeah and it’s totally, definitely true that the ZK techniques today will handle the smaller models that are being used – but definitely the LLMs are probably too big for these techniques to handle today, the ZK techniques; but, you know they&#8217;re constantly getting better, the hardware is getting better, and so hopefully they&#8217;ll catch up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah; before we go on, can we just do a really clear pulse-check then on where we are *exactly* in that – So obviously, what I&#8217;m hearing you guys say is that there are tremendous applications at the intersection of general verifiable computing – which blockchains and crypto have definitely been significantly advancing and accelerating that whole area (we&#8217;ve been covering a ton of it ourselves: if you look at our ZK canon and zero knowledge category, you&#8217;ll see so much of this covered there) –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut where are we \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C\u002Fem\u003E right now in terms of what they can do? Because you guys talked a lot about what they can&#8217;t do yet, and what the opportunity is, which is exciting; but where are we right now, like what can they actually do?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. So right now, they can basically do classification for medium-sized models. So not something as big as GPT-3 or 4, but medium-sized models. &lt;yup&gt; It is possible to prove that the classification was done correctly. Training is probably beyond what can be done right now, just because training is sooo compute intensive &lt;Sonal: right&gt; that for proof systems we&#8217;re not there yet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut like Ali said, we have other ways to do it. For example, we can have multiple people do the training, and then compare the results. Yah? So that now there are game theory incentives for people not to cheat. If somebody cheats, somebody else might be able to complain that they computed the training incorrectly, and then whoever cheated will not be paid for their effort &lt;Sonal: right right, yah&gt; So there&#8217;s an incentive for people to actually run the training the way it was supposed to run.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Right. And so basically that sort of – not like a hybrid phase, but it&#8217;s basically like alt approaches until more of this comes to scale, and performance is scaled to a point where we can get there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah; I would say that for some models classification can be proved in zero knowledge today. For training right now, we have to rely on optimistic techniques.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, great.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Ali, you mentioned compute is one of the three prongs – and you also mentioned that data and then the models for machine learning themselves – do you want to tackle now data, and sort of the opportunities and challenges there (where it comes to the crypto\u002FAI intersection).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, absolutely. So, I think that there is an opportunity – even though the problems involved are very difficult – to both decentralize the process of sourcing data for training of large machine learning models &lt;mhm&gt; from a broader community. Again, instead of having a single centralized player, just collect all of the data &lt;yah&gt; and then train the models themselves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this could work by creating a kind of marketplace that&#8217;s similar to the one that we just described for compute – but instead, incentivize people to contribute new data to some big dataset that then gets used to train a model.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty with this is similar in that there&#8217;s a verification challenge – you have to somehow verify that the data that people are contributing is actually good data &lt;Sonal: yah!&gt; and that it&#8217;s not either duplicate data or garbage data that was just sort of randomly generated or not real in some way. And to also make sure that the data doesn&#8217;t somehow subvert the model – some kind of poisoning attack – where the model actually becomes either backdoored, or just sort of less good or less performant than it used to be. And so there&#8217;s the question of how do you verify that that is the case?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is maybe an open hard problem for the community to solve. It may be impossible to solve completely, and you might have to rely on a combination of technological solutions with social solutions – where you also have some kind of reputation metric. That members in the community are able to earn, to build up credibility such that when they contribute data, the data can then be trusted a little bit more than it would be otherwise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what this might allow you to do, is that you can now \u003Cem\u003Etruly \u003C\u002Fem\u003Ecover the very very long tail of the data distribution.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd one of the things that&#8217;s very challenging in the world of machine learning, is that your model is really only as good as the coverage of the distribution that your training dataset can achieve. &lt;yup&gt; And if there are inputs that are far, far out of the distribution of the training data, then your model might actually behave in a way that&#8217;s completely unpredictable. And in order to actually get the model to perform well in the edge cases – and the sort of black swan data points, or data inputs that you might experience in the real world – you do want to have your dataset be as comprehensive as possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so: If you had this kind of open, decentralized marketplace for the \u003Cem\u003Econtribution\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of data to a dataset, you could have anyone who has very very unique data out in the world contribute that data to the network… Which is a better way to do this, because if you try to do this as a central company, you have no way of knowing who has that data. And so if you flip it around and create an incentive for those people to come forward – and provide that data on their own accord – then I think you can actually get significantly better coverage of the long tail.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd as we&#8217;ve seen, the performance of machine learning models continues to improve as the dataset grows, and as the diversity of the data points in the dataset grows. And so this can actually supercharge the performance of our machine learning models to an even greater degree; [where] we&#8217;re able to get even more comprehensive datasets that could cover the whole community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So let me turn this on its head in that uh…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Oooh, go for it, Dan!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E &#8230;If we&#8217;re going to incentivize people to contribute data, basically we&#8217;re going to incentivize people to create fake data &lt;Sonal: yes!&gt; so they can get paid. Yeah? So we have to have some sort of a mechanism to make sure that the data you&#8217;re contributing is authentic. &lt;Ali: Exactly&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you can imagine a couple of ways of doing this, right? I mean, one way is actually by relying on trusted hardware &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;: Maybe the sensors themselves are embedded in some trusted hardware that we would only trust data that&#8217;s properly signed by the hardware. That&#8217;s one way to do things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, we would have to have some other mechanism by which we can tell whether the data is authentic or not.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Completely agree.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat&#8217;d be the biggest open problem to solve… And I think that as benchmarking for machine learning models gets better, I think there&#8217;s two important trends in machine learning at the moment &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[1] There&#8217;s improving the measurement of the performance of a machine learning model. And for LLMs, that&#8217;s still very much in its early stages and that it&#8217;s actually quite hard to know how good an LLM is. Because it&#8217;s not as if it were like a classifier where what the performance of a model is very clearly defined. With an LLM, it&#8217;s almost as if you&#8217;re testing the intelligence of a human. Right? &lt;Sonal: mhm!&gt; And coming up with the right way of testing how intelligent an LLM like Chat-GPT is an open area of research. But over time, I think that&#8217;ll become better and better.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E[2] And then the other trend is that we&#8217;re getting better at being able to explain how it is that a model works.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so with both of those things, at some point, it might become feasible to understand the effect that a dataset has on a machine learning model&#8217;s performance. &lt;Sonal: yes&gt; And if we can have a good understanding of whether or not a dataset that was contributed by a third party helped the machine learning model&#8217;s performance, then we can reward that contribution –  and we can create the incentive for that marketplace to exist.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So just to summarize so far, what I heard you guys say is that –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThere&#8217;s trusted hardware that can help check the accuracy of the data that&#8217;s being contributed, and the models that are being contributed;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAli, you mentioned briefly reputation metrics and that type of thing can help;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EYou also mentioned that there might be a way (not necessarily now, but sometime in the near future) to check how the data is influencing the outcomes in a particular model so that you can actually&#8230;it&#8217;s not quite explainable, but the idea is that you can actually attribute that this dataset caused this particular effect.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there&#8217;s a range of various techniques you guys have shared so far.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, the final thing is that you could do the same thing for the third prong, which is models.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine if you could create an open marketplace for people to contribute a trained model that is able to solve a particular kind of problem. So imagine if on Ethereum you created a smart contract that embedded some kind of test – be it like a cognitive test that an LLM could solve, or some classification test that a classifier machine learning model that is a classifier could solve –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if using ZKML, someone could provide a model alongside a proof that that model can solve that test – then again you now have the tools that you need to create a marketplace that incentivizes people to contribute machine learning models, that can solve certain problems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo many of the problems that we&#8217;ve discussed – the open problems that we&#8217;ve discussed – on how to do that are also present here… In particular, there&#8217;s a ZKML piece where you have to be able to prove that the model is actually doing the work that it&#8217;s claiming that it&#8217;s doing. And then also, we need to be able to have good tests of how good a model is. Right, so being able to embed a test inside of a smart contract that then you can subject a machine learning model to evaluate how good it is. This is another very nascent part of this whole technology trend.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut in theory, it&#8217;d be great if we eventually get to a world where we do have these very open, bottom-up, transparent marketplaces that allow people to contribute and source compute, data, and machine learning models for machine learning – that essentially act again as a counterweight to the very very centralized, enormous tech companies that are driving all of the AI work today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I really love Ali how you mentioned that, because it&#8217;s been a \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C\u002Fem\u003E standing problem in AI in practice that it can solve a lot of things for like the bell curve, the middle of the norm, but not the tail ends. And a classic example of this is self-driving cars, right, like you can do everything with a certain amount of standard behaviors, but it&#8217;s the edge cases where the real accidents and catastrophic things can happen. &lt;Ali: Right&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that was super helpful; And I know you talked about some of the incentive alignment, and incentives for providing accurate and quality data – and even incentives for just even contributing anything in the long tail of data overall –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut on the long-tail side: a quick question that popped up for me when you were talking, like, it sort of begs the question of then who makes money *where*, in this system? I couldn’t help but wonder, what does the business model kind of come in then in terms of making money for companies? Because I always understood that in the long tail of AI (in a world of this kind of available datasets), that your proprietary data is actually your unique domain knowledge, and kind of the thing that only you know in that long tail – so do you guys have any quick responses to that?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So I think that the vision behind crypto intersecting with AI is that you could create a set of protocols that distributes the value that will eventually be captured by this new technology, by AI, amongst a much larger group of people. Essentially a community of people, all of whom can contribute and all of whom can take part of the upside of this new technology. &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo then the people who would be making money would be the people who are contributing compute, or the people who are contributing data, or the people who are contributing new machine learning models to the network – such that better machine learning models can be trained and better, bigger, more important problems can be solved.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other people that would be making money at the same time are the people who, on the other side, are on the demand side of this network: People who are using this as infrastructure for training their own machine learning models. &lt;Sonal: yes&gt; Maybe their model does something interesting in the world, maybe it&#8217;s like the next generation of ChatGPT. And then that then goes on to make its way into a bunch of different applications – like say enterprise applications or whatever it is that those models may be used for – and those models drive value capture in their own right, because those companies will have a business model of their own.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd then finally, the people who might also make money are the people who build this network. Right, so for example: Create a token for the network; that token will be distributed to the community; and all of those people will have collective ownership over this decentralized network for compute data and models that may also capture some value of all of the economic activity that goes through this network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you can imagine any payment for compute, or any payment for data, or any payment for models &lt;mhm&gt; could have some fee imparted on it. It might just go to some treasury that&#8217;s controlled by this decentralized network that all tokenholders that are part of this network have collective ownership and access to as well (as the creators and owners of the marketplace).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that fee might just go to the network. So you can imagine that every transaction that goes through this network, every form of payment that pays for compute or pays for data or pays for models – might have some fee that&#8217;s imparted on it that goes to some treasury that&#8217;s controlled by the whole network, and by the token holders that collectively own the network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so that&#8217;s essentially a business model for the network itself.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Great!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay. So so far we&#8217;ve been talking a lot about the way that crypto can help AI – I mean, to be clear, it&#8217;s not like unidirectional; these things are kind of reinforcing and bidirectional and more interactive than one way –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, for the purpose of this discussion, we&#8217;re really talking about it being like here&#8217;s how crypto can help AI; let&#8217;s now kind of turn it on its head and talk a little bit more about ways that AI can help crypto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, so there’re a couple of interesting touchpoints there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo one that&#8217;s actually worth bringing up is this idea of machine learning models that are used to generate code. So many of the listeners have probably heard of Copilot, which is a tool that&#8217;s used to generate code. And what&#8217;s interesting is you can try to use these code generation tools to write Solidity contracts, or to write cryptography code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I want to stress that this is actually a very dangerous thing to do.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ohhh! Do NOT do this at home; okay. &lt;chuckles&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. Yah. Do not try this at home.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause what happens is very often these systems actually will generate code that works, you know, when you try to run it – and, you know, encryption is the opposite of decryption and so on – so the code will actually work, but it will actually be insecure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;ve actually written a paper about this recently that shows that if you try to get Copilot to just write something as simple as just an encryption function, it will give you something that does encryption correctly – but it uses an incorrect mode of operation yah, so that you&#8217;ll end up with an insecure encryption mode.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, if you try to get it to generate Solidity code, you might end up with Solidity code that works – but it will have vulnerabilities, in it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you might wonder, why does that happen? And one of the reasons is because these models are basically trained on codes that&#8217;s out there, they&#8217;re trained on GitHub repositories. Well, you know, a lot of the GitHub repositories actually are vulnerable to all sorts of attacks. And so these models learn about code that works – but not code that is secure; it&#8217;s almost like garbage in, garbage out yah? &lt;Sonal: mhmmm!&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so I do want to make sure people are very, very careful – when they use these generative models to generate code – that they very, very carefully check that the code actually does what it&#8217;s supposed to do, and that it does it securely.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E One idea on that front – I&#8217;m curious what you think about this – is that you can use AI models like LLM (sort of like ChatGPT) to generate code, in conjunction with other tools to try to make the process less error-prone?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so one example, one idea &lt;oh&gt; would be to use an LLM to generate a spec for a formal verification system: So basically you describe your program in English; and you ask the LLM to generate a spec for a formal verification tool; then you ask the same instance of the LLM to generate the program, that meets that spec. &lt;mm!&gt; And then you use a formal verification tool to see whether the program actually meets the spec.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if there are errors, that tool will catch the errors; those errors can then be used as feedback back to the LLM. And then ideally, hopefully, the LLM can then revise its work, and then produce another version of the code that is correct. And eventually – if you do this again and again – you end up with a piece of code that ideally fully meets the spec, and is formally verified to meet the spec.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd because the spec is maybe \u003Cem\u003Ereadable\u003C\u002Fem\u003E by a human, you can kind of maybe go through the spec and see like, yes, this is the program that I intended to write. And that can be an actually pretty good way to use LLMs to write code that also isn&#8217;t as prone to errors as it might be if you were to just ask ChatGPT to generate a smart contract for you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Clever!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah, this is great – and actually this leads into another topic that is worth discussing, which is basically using LLMs to find bugs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo suppose a programmer actually writes some Solidity code; and now you want to test, is that code correct, is it secure? And like Ali said, you can actually try to use the LLM to find vulnerabilities in that code. And there&#8217;s been actually quite a bit of work on trying to assess how good LLMs are at finding finding bugs in software, in Solidity smart contracts, in C and C++.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s one paper that came out recently that&#8217;s actually very relevant – it&#8217;s a paper from the University of Manchester &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; – whuch says that you would run a standard static analysis tool to find bugs in your code; and it would find all sorts of memory-management bugs or potential bugs – just a standard static analysis tool; no machine learning whatsoever.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then you would use an LLM to try and \u003Cem\u003Efix \u003C\u002Fem\u003Ethe code. Yah? &lt;Sonal: mm&gt; &lt;Ali: exactly&gt; So it proposes a fix to the bug automatically. And then you would run the static analyzer again on the fixed code, &lt;Ali: yes&gt; and the static analyzer would say, oh, the bug is still there or the bug is not there. And you would keep iterating until the static analyzer says: yeah, now the bug has been fixed and there&#8217;s no more issues there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo that was kind of an interesting paper; this paper literally came out like two weeks ago.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So, for both of these papers you just referenced, Dan – the one from the University of Manchester and also the one that you guys recently wrote on LLMs not being trusted to write correct code (it could be working code, but not necessarily secure), I&#8217;ll link to those papers in the show notes &lt;Dan: great&gt; so that listeners can find them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust one quick question before we move on from this… So this is about the current state; is this a temporary situation, or do you think there will be a time when LLMs can be trusted to write correct – not just working, but \u003Cem\u003Esecure\u003C\u002Fem\u003E – smart contract code? Is that possible or is that just like way far off?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s a difficult question to answer. You know these models are improving by leaps and bounds every week, right. &lt;Sonal: Yah&gt; So it&#8217;s possible that by next year, these issues will already be addressed, and that they could be trusted to write more secure code. I guess we&#8217;re saying that right now, the current models that we have (GPT-4, GPT-3, and so on), if you use them to generate code, you have to be very very careful and verify that the code that they wrote actually does what it&#8217;s supposed to do and is, is it secure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Got it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And by the way, will we get to a point where the code that LLMs generate is less likely to contain bugs than the code that a human generates? &lt;Sonal: yes!!!&gt; And maybe that&#8217;s a more important question, right?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause in the same way that you can never say that a self-driving car will never crash – the real question that actually matters is: Is it less likely to crash than if it were a human driver. &lt;Sonal: That&#8217;s exactly right&gt; Because the truth is that it&#8217;s probably impossible to guarantee that there will never be a car crash that is caused by a self-driving car, or that there will never be a bug &lt;Sonal: right&gt; that&#8217;s generated by an LLM that you&#8217;ve asked to write any code.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think this will only, by the way, get more and more powerful the more you integrate it into existing toolchains. So as we discussed, you can integrate this into formal verification toolchains. You can integrate this into other tools, like the one that Dan described where you have a tool that checks for memory management issues. You can also integrate it into unit testing, and integration testing toolchains… So that the LLM is not just acting in a vacuum: It is getting real-time feedback from other tools that are connecting it to the ground truth.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think that through the combination of machine learning models that are extremely big, trained with all of the data in the world – combined with these other tools – might actually make for programmers that are quite a bit superior than human programmers. &lt;mhm&gt; And even if they might still make mistakes, they might just be superhuman.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that&#8217;ll be a big moment for the world of software engineering generally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yeah. That&#8217;s a great framing, Ali…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what are some of the other trends that come in for where AI can help crypto, and vice versa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah… One exciting possibility in the space is that we may be able to build decentralized social networks that actually behave a lot like Twitter might – but where the social graph is actually fully on chain and it&#8217;s almost like a public good that anyone can build on top of.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd you as a user, you control your own identity on the social graph. You control your own data, you control who you follow and who can follow you. And then there&#8217;s a whole ecosystem of companies that build portals into the social graph that provide users experiences that are maybe somewhat like Twitter, or somewhat like Instagram, or somewhat like TikTok; or whatever else they may want to build.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it&#8217;s all on top of this same social graph &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; that nobody owns that there&#8217;s no billion-dollar tech company in the middle that has complete control over it, and that can decide what happens on it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so in that world, like that&#8217;s an exciting world because it means that it can be much more dynamic; and there can be this whole ecosystem of people building things and there&#8217;s much more control by each of the users over what they see and what they get to do on the platform. But there&#8217;s also the need to filter the signal from the noise. And there&#8217;s for example the need to come up with sensible recommendation algorithms that filter all of the content and show you a newsfeed that you actually want to see.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this will open the door to a whole marketplace – a competitive environment – of participants who provide you maybe with algorithms, with AI-based algorithms that curate content for you. And you as a user might have a choice: You can decide whether to go with one particular algorithm, maybe the algorithm that was built by Twitter, or, you can also go with one that&#8217;s built by someone completely different.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that kind of autonomy will be great – but again, you&#8217;re going to need tools like machine learning and AI to help you sift through the noise, and to help parse through all of the spam that inevitably will exist in a world where generative models can create all of the spam in the world.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What&#8217;s interesting about what you said too is like it&#8217;s not even about choosing between – It goes back to this idea you mentioned earlier, and you mentioned this briefly about just giving users the options to pick from marketplaces of free ideas and approaches that they can decide –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it&#8217;s also interesting because it&#8217;s not even only at a company-to-company level, it&#8217;s really just like, what approach works for you? Like you might be a person who&#8217;s maybe more interested in the collaborative filtering algorithm that was in the original form of original recommendation systems, which is like collaborative filtering across people &lt;Ali: yah&gt; so your friends&#8217; recommendations are the things you follow.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen in fact, I personally am very different and much more interested in an interest graph; and therefore, I might be much more interested in people who just have similar interests to me – and I might pick that approach versus say, something else that&#8217;s sort of like hey this is a hybrid approach, your only thing it&#8217;s going to do is X Y and Z.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust even being able to pick and choose that is already tremendously empowering. That&#8217;s just simply not possible, right now. And it can only be possible with crypto and AI. So that&#8217;s a great example. &lt;oh yah&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWas there anything more to say on how AI can help with trust and security??\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E So I think that kind of the meta picture is that crypto is the Wild West. Because it&#8217;s completely permissionless, because anyone can participate – you kind of have to assume that whomever is participating might be an adversary &lt;yes&gt; and maybe trying to game the system or hack the system or do something malicious.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so there&#8217;s much more of a need for tools that help you filter the honest participants from the dishonest ones &lt;mm&gt; – and machine learning, and AI, as an intelligence tool can actually be very helpful on that front.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo for example, there&#8217;s a project called Stelo, which uses machine learning to identify suspicious transactions that are submitted to a wallet – and that flags those transactions for the user before those transactions are submitted to the blockchain. And that could be a good way to prevent the user from accidentally sending all of their funds to an attacker, or from doing something that they will regret later. &lt;mhm&gt; And that company basically sells to wallets (to companies like Metamask) such that then Metamask can use the intel – and then do whatever it wants with it, either block the transaction or warn the user; or, sort of, reframe the transaction so that it&#8217;s no longer dangerous. And so that&#8217;s one example.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are other examples as well in the context of MEV – which stands for minor extractable value &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; or maximum extractable value, depending on who you ask &lt;Sonal: yah! chuckles&gt; – which is the value that can be extracted by the people who have control over the ordering of transactions on a blockchain. And that&#8217;s often the miners or the validators of a blockchain.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd AI here – I mean, can cut both ways in that those participants – if you&#8217;re a validator on a blockchain, and you have control over ordering of transactions, you can do all sorts of clever things to order those transactions in such a way that you profit. You can for example front-run transactions, you can back-run transactions, you can sandwich orders on Uniswap. There&#8217;s a lot- a lot of transactions that you could craft such that you can profit from this ability of ordering transactions. And machine learning and AI might supercharge that ability because it can search for opportunities &lt;yes&gt; to capture more and more MEV.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then on the other hand, machine learning may help in the other way: in that it may help as a defensive tool. You may be aware, before you submit a transaction, that there is MEV that might be extractable from that transaction. And so then maybe you will either split up your transaction into multiple transactions so that there isn&#8217;t a single validator &lt;mhm&gt; that can completely control it, or do something as a way of protecting yourself from an MEV extractor, at some point in the transaction pipeline.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this is a way again where crypto plays a big role when it comes to security, when it comes to trust, when it comes to making the space more trustworthy to the end user.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s an example of AI making things difficult in crypto, and then crypto coming back and making things better for… &lt;chuckles&gt;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E I actually have another example like that. &lt;Sonal: yah!&gt; So just like ML models can be used to detect fake data or maybe malicious activity &lt;mm&gt;, there&#8217;s the flip side where ML models can actually be used to generate fake data. &lt;Sonal: yes&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe classic example of that is deep fakes, right – where you can create a video of someone saying things they never said, then that video looks fairly realistic. And the interesting thing is that actually blockchains can help to alleviate the problem. And so let me just walk you through one possible approach, where blockchains might be useful:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine it&#8217;s a solution that might be only applicable to well-known figures like politicians or maybe uh movie stars and such &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt;. But imagine basically a politician would wear a camera on their chest, and kind of record what they do all day long &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; – and then kind of create a Merkle tree out of that recording, and push the Merkle tree commitments onto the blockchain. &lt;mhm&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo now on the blockchain, there&#8217;s a timestamp saying you know on this and this date, you said such and such; on this and that date, you said such and such. And now if somebody creates a deep fake video of this politician saying things they never said; well, the politician can say look, at this time where the video said I said this and that, I was actually somewhere completely different, doing something unrelated.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the fact that all this data, the real data, the real authentic data is recorded on a blockchain can be used to prove that the deep fake really is fake and not real data. Yeah?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo this is not something that exists yet. &lt;Sonal: yup&gt; It would be kind of fun for someone to build something like this – but I thought it&#8217;s kind of an interesting example where blockchains might actually be helpful &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; in combating deep fakes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Is there also a way to solve that problem and show other timestamps or provenance – where you can do that sort of verification of what&#8217;s true\u002F what&#8217;s not true without having to make a politician walk around with like a camera &lt;Dan chuckles&gt; on their chest.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yes, absolutely. We can also rely on trusted hardware for this; &lt;mhm&gt; So imagine you know, our cameras, the cameras in our phones and such, they would actually sign the images and video that they take &lt;Sonal: yup&gt;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s a standard, it&#8217;s called C2PA that specifies how cameras will sign data – in fact, there&#8217;s a camera by Sony that now will actually take pictures and take videos and then produce C2PA signatures on those videos… So now you basically have authentic data; you can actually kind of prove that the data really came from a C2PA camera.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd now Sonal if you maybe read a newspaper article, and there&#8217;s a picture in the newspaper article, and it claims to be from one place but in fact it&#8217;s taken from a different place; the signature could actually be verified the fact that it&#8217;s C2PA-signed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s a lot of nuances there – C2PA is a fairly complicated topic – &lt;mhm&gt; that there&#8217;s a lot of nuances to discuss and maybe we won&#8217;t get into here;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Dan I remember you talking about this work with me previously (I think it was at our offite); but I also remember from that that it doesn’t stand up to editing? And as you know, editorial people like me and other content creators – and honestly just about anyone (who uses Instagram or any online posting)&#8230; no one, like uploads anything purely, rawly like as they were originally created…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan: Y\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003Eeah, typically when newspapers will publish pictures in a newspaper, they don&#8217;t publish the picture from the camera as-is; they will crop it. There&#8217;s like a couple of authorized things they are allowed to do to the pictures: maybe they grayscale it; definitely they downsample it (so that they don&#8217;t take a lot of bandwidth).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe minute you start editing the picture, that means that the recipient – the end reader, the user on the browser who&#8217;s reading the article – can no longer verify the C2PA signature. Because they don&#8217;t have the original image. &lt;Sonal: Right!&gt; So the question is, how do you let the user verify that the image they&#8217;re looking at really was properly signed by a C2PA camera.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, as usual, this is exactly where zero-knowledge techniques come in &lt;Sonal: mmm!&gt; – where you can prove that the edited image actually is the result of applying just downsampling and grayscaling to a properly signed larger image. Yah? And so instead of a C2PA signature, we would have a ZK proof – a short ZK proof – associated with each one of these images. And now the readers can still verify &lt;mhm&gt; that they&#8217;re looking at authentic images.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it&#8217;s very interesting that ZK techniques can be used to fight disinformation. It&#8217;s a bit of an unexpected application.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E That&#8217;s fantastic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E A very related problem by the way, is proving that you&#8217;re actually human &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; in a world where all of the deep fakes creating the appearance of humanity will generally outnumber humans a thousand to one or a million to one. And most things on the internet might actually be generated by AI.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so one potential solution – which is related to what you&#8217;re saying – is to use biometrics to be able to establish that someone is actually human. But to then use zero-knowledge proofs to protect the privacy, of the people, who are using those biometrics to prove their humanity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo one project in this category is called WorldCoin &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; – it&#8217;s also a project in our portfolio – and they use this orb; people may have seen this like shiny silver orb, that uses retinal scans as biometric information to verify that you&#8217;re actually a real human; and it also has all sorts of other sensors to make sure that you&#8217;re actually alive and that it can&#8217;t actually be a picture of an eye. And it&#8217;s this system that has secure hardware and is very difficult to tamper with –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch that the proof that emerges on the other end, which is a zero-knowledge proof that obscures your actual biometric information, is very, very difficult to forge. And this way, politicians could for example &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; prove that their video stream or that a signature of theirs or that a participation of theirs on some online forum is actually their own, and that they&#8217;re actually human.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E What&#8217;s really interesting about what you said, Ali – that&#8217;s a great follow up to what Dan was saying about ways to verify like authentic media vs. like fake or deep-fake media – and this world of infinite media (as you would say) that we live in –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what are the other applications for proof-of-personhood-type technologies like that? I think it&#8217;s important, because this is actually another example of how crypto can help AI more broadly too. Going back&#8230;we&#8217;re kind of flipping back and forth here, &lt;Ali: yah&gt; but that&#8217;s okay because we&#8217;re just talking about really interesting applications, period so it’s fine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well that&#8217;s a really good question… One of the things that will become important in a world where anyone can participate online is to be able to prove that you are human – for various different purposes. There is that famous saying from the &#8217;90s that “on the internet, nobody knows you&#8217;re a dog”. &lt;Sonal: oh yah, yah&gt; And I think maybe-maybe a reshaped form of that saying is that on the internet, nobody knows you&#8217;re a bot. &lt;Sonal: uh huh?&gt; And so then I guess this is exactly where proof of humanity projects become very important &lt;Sonal: yah&gt; – because it will become important to know whether you&#8217;re interacting with a bot or with a human…\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, in the world of crypto, there&#8217;s this whole question of governance: How do you govern systems &lt;yes&gt; that are decentralized, that don&#8217;t have any single point of control, and that are bottom-up and community-owned? You would want some kind of governance system that allows you to control the evolution of those systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the problem today is that if you don&#8217;t have proof of humanity, then you can&#8217;t tell whether one address belongs to a single human; or whether it belongs to a bunch of humans; or whether 10000 addresses actually belong to a single human, and are pretending to be 10000 different people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so today you actually kind of have to just use amount of money as a proxy for voting power, which leads to plutocratic governance. &lt;Sonal: yah exactly&gt; But if every participant in a governance system could prove that they&#8217;re actually human, and they could do so in a way that&#8217;s unique – such that they can&#8217;t actually pretend to be more than one human because they only have a single set of eyeballs – then the governance system could be much more fair, and less plutocratic, and can be based more on each individual&#8217;s preferences. Rather than on the preference of the largest amount of money that&#8217;s locked up in some smart contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Actually, just to give an example of that –\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, we&#8217;re forced to use “one token, one vote” because we don&#8217;t have proof of humanity. Maybe we&#8217;d like to do one human, one vote – but if you can pretend to be five humans, then, of course, that doesn&#8217;t work. And so one example where this comes up is something called quadratic voting. &lt;Sonal: yup&gt;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo in quadratic voting, basically, if you want to vote five times for something, you have to you have to, kind of, put 25 chits down to do that. But, of course, you can do the same thing, you can just pretend to be five different people each voting once, and that would kind of defeat the mechanism of quadratic voting. So the only way to prevent you from doing that is this exact proof of humanity – where in order to vote, you have to prove that you&#8217;re a single entity rather than a Sybil of entities. And that&#8217;s exactly where proof of humanity would play an important role.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, identity on-chain is actually becoming quite important for governance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally…  That by the way reminded me of an episode that you and I did Ali years ago with Phil Daian, &lt;Ali: oh yah&gt; remember, on “dark DAOs”? &lt;Ali: yes… exactly&gt; That was such an interesting discussion. Totally relevant there.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Totally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E By the way, is the phrase “proof of personhood” or “proof of humanity”? What&#8217;s the difference, is it the same thing?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ah yah, people use them interchangeably – proof of human, proof of humanity, proof of personhood.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Yah, yah.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so keep going on this theme then of media, and this kind of “infinite abundance” of media, like what are other examples – and again, we&#8217;re talking about crypto helping AI, AI helping crypto &lt;Ali: yah&gt; – are there any other examples that we haven&#8217;t covered here where the intersection of crypto and AI can bring about things, that aren&#8217;t possible by either one of them alone?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Completely. I mean, another implication of these generative models is that we&#8217;re going to live in a world of infinite abundance of media. And in such a world, things like \u003Cem\u003Ecommunity\u003C\u002Fem\u003E around any one particular piece of media – or the narrative around a particular piece of media – will become ever more important.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to make this very concrete, there&#8217;s two good examples here: Sound.xyz is building a decentralized music streaming platform enabling artists (musicians, essentially) to upload music, and to then connect directly with their communities – by selling them NFTs that give people in those communities certain privileges. Like for example: the ability to post a comment on the Sound.xyz website on the track, such that anyone else who plays the song can also see the comment. (This is similar to the old SoundCloud feature that people might remember where you could have like this whole social experience on the music itself as it played on the website.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s this ability to allow people to engage with the media and to engage with each other – Often in a way that&#8217;s economic because they&#8217;re essentially buying this NFT from the artist as a way of being able to do this. And they are, as a side effect, they are supporting the artist, and helping the artist be sustainable and be able to create more music.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the beauty of all of this, is that actually gives an artist a forum to really interact with their community. And the artist is a human artist. And as a result of crypto being in the loop here: You can create a community around a piece of music – that wouldn&#8217;t automatically exist around a piece of music – that was just created by a machine learning model that&#8217;s devoid of any human element, that doesn&#8217;t have a community around it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so I think again – in a world where a lot of the music that we&#8217;re going to be exposed to will be fully generated by AI – the tools to build community and to tell a story around art, around music, around other kinds of media will be very important as a way of… sort of distinguishing media that we really care about and really want to invest in and spend time with – from media that may also be very good, but it&#8217;s just a different kind of media. It&#8217;s media that was just generated by AI with less of a human element. &lt;yah&gt; And it may be, by the way, that there&#8217;s some synergy between the two:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike, it could be that a lot of the music will be AI enhanced or AI generated. But if there&#8217;s also a human element – like say for example if a creator leveraged AI tools to create a new piece of music – but they also have a personality on Sound, they have an artist page, they have built a community for themselves, and they have a following – then now you have like this kind of synergy between the two worlds. &lt;yah&gt; Where you both have the best music because it&#8217;s augmented by the superpowers that AI gives you; but you also have a human element and a story, that was coordinated and made real by this crypto aspect (which lets you bring all of those people together into one platform).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It&#8217;s really quite amazing that even in the world of music – just like we talked about in the world of coding, where you have a human coder that&#8217;s being enhanced by tools like Copilot that generate code – we are seeing things like this, where an artist is being enhanced by ML systems that help write (or at least parts of the music are being written and generated by an ML system). So it&#8217;s definitely a new world that we&#8217;re kind of moving into in terms of content generation – basically there&#8217;s going to be a lot of spam that&#8217;s generated by machine-generated art &lt;yah&gt;, which people might not value as much as they value art that&#8217;s generated by an actual human.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe another way to say it is one of the points of NFTs was to support the artists. &lt;Sonal: yes&gt; But if the artists themselves are now machine-learning models, then who exactly are we supporting? &lt;chuckles&gt; &lt;Sonal: yah… yah&gt; And so it&#8217;s a question of how do we distinguish, how do we differentiate human-generated art that needs support &lt;Sonal: Yes&gt; versus machine-generated art?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESonal:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well, this is a philosophical discussion for over drinks maybe – but I would maybe go so far as to say that the prompter is also an artist, of sorts. &lt;Ali: yah&gt; And in fact, I would make the case that that person is an artist. And the same thing has come about with &#8211; as this is a discussion and debate as old as time: and it just simply is new technologies, old behaviors. It&#8217;s the same thing that&#8217;s been playing out for eons. And the same thing&#8217;s playing out in the writing, etc., totally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDan:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Very true.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAli:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Well that actually opens up the door for collective art &lt;Sonal: mhm&gt; – for art that&#8217;s generated through the creative process of a whole community, as opposed to a single artist;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are actually already projects that are doing this, where: You have a process by which a community influences through some voting process on-chain what the prompt for a machine learning model like DALL-E will be. &lt;mhm&gt; Then you have DALL-E use that prompt to generate a work of art – maybe you generate not 1 work of art but like 10000 – and then you use another machine learning model, that&#8217;s also trained from feedback by the community, to pick from those 10000 the best one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERight and so then now you have a work of art; that was generated from the input of the community; that was also pruned and selected from a set of 10000 variants of that work of art &lt;yup&gt; – also through a machine learning model that&#8217;s trained by the community – to then generate one work of art.

We’ve gone from barely detecting cats in YouTube videos to building cars that can drive themselves. And yet, as our aspirations for AI have become grander, it has slowly become a game that only tech giants can play. The knowledge and resources that are necessary to innovate in the space are now simply out of reach for most individuals and startups. How can we change that? The only answer is to build new technology that levels the playing field.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA common refrain in 2018 was “AI is communist; crypto is libertarian.” It was said first by Peter Thiel as a tongue-in-cheek observation that, while crypto is a technology movement that strives to decentralize power, AI is another that can’t seem to help but centralize it. This might ring true: crypto is a technology that is all about building systems that are owned and controlled by diverse communities, whereas AI today is one that relies on consolidation of data and tends to supercharge a central entity’s ability to make top-down decisions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the past decade, this view has become our dominant narrative about AI. Nary a week goes by without headlines that bemoan the excesses of the concentrated power now wielded by tech giants and how it tragically undermines democracy, corrupts youths, causes reflux, etc. Much of society now seems to assume that the only way we can ever hope to wrest that power away from the likes of Google and Facebook is, ironically, through the exercise of yet another kind of centralized power—top-down and inevitably heavy-handed government regulation. The truth is, however, that it’s a monumental failure of imagination for us to believe that we are at the end of history — that not a single path forward exists for a startup to build technology that shifts the balance of power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is almost natural to think that there is something inherent to AI that lends advantages to large players — that AI is inescapably “communist.” The story that people like to tell focuses on how tech giants hoard all of our personal data and benefit from unassailable “data network effects.” But the real reason that tech giants are good at AI is actually much simpler. They are good at it because they invest in it. They have every reason to do so.

Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C\u002Fem\u003E that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces.” Human thinking somehow has the power to tell apart what is fundamental from what is merely incidental and thus can generalize to the long tail without us having to experience it directly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair, the inductive model at the heart of a deep neural network also has some power of generalization, but there’s a catch. The key inductivist assumption is that the future will resemble the past and the unseen will resemble the seen. And true, sometimes it does. More often, however, the reality is otherwise. The world is radically nonlinear. One does not simply model it with a quilt of stitched-together linear functions, for, as it turns out, the future and the unseen are often unrecognizably different from the past and the seen. As a case in point, think of the inner workings at the center of a distant star whose light began its long journey towards Earth thousands of years ago. There is nothing that even remotely resembles the environment of that star here on Earth.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout an explanation for why a pattern that so reliably holds in the common case should continue to hold in cases that are less common (the edge cases), a deep neural network’s strides become just as blind as they are confident when they venture into the long tail. The darkness of that realm, for a neural network, can be illuminated only by direct experience with it — real training examples drawn from the long tail itself that can help mold the network&#8217;s linear predilections into better fitting nonlinear ones. But, of course, those training examples are, by definition, outliers and the hardest to come across.

Ethereum is the first example of such a computer. It extended the ideas behind Bitcoin by including support for a general purpose programming language.

The genius at the heart of Ethereum and Bitcoin (and crypto more generally) is a set of incentive structures that makes these systems self-policing. Through well-calibrated economic rewards, cryptonetworks like Ethereum encourage their users to keep one another in check. And so, even though they may not trust one another, they can come to trust in the decentralized computer that they are collectively helping secure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe defining property of such a computer is therefore that everyone can come to trust (and verify) that the programs that are deployed to it will indeed run and will run correctly \u003Cem\u003Eas written\u003C\u002Fem\u003E no matter what. This is why these programs have come to be known as &#8220;smart contracts.&#8221;  A better term for them, however, might be &#8220;sovereign programs&#8221; because, once deployed, they are independent — they deterministically execute themselves, instruction by instruction, subject to nobody&#8217;s authority. They run with immunity from intervention by (1) the people who originally wrote them; (2) the people who interact with them while they are running; and (3) even the people who control the physical machines that execute them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is this inviolable sovereignty that allows a smart contract to credibly act as a trusted intermediary between strangers. In fact, it is exactly this property that empowers a single program — e.g. the Bitcoin codebase — to come alive as a fully digital, global store of value. But that&#8217;s just the beginning. Smart contracts are a fundamentally new computational building block that is very general. They unlock a realm of possible applications that we have barely begun to explore. A few of them might even have something to do with A.I.!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is, in fact, a coincidence that’s worthy of good sci-fi that, as a considerable subset of humanity finds itself doggedly working toward strong AI, another subset (conveniently disjoint from the first) is set on building an unstoppable world computer.

No need to make it Skynet. Let’s instead think through a network that is dead simple — say, a classifier that accepts as input an image and produces as output a prediction of what it thinks the image contains (e.g. “car,” “dog,” “honey badger,” “the number three,” etc.).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the beginning, our model will be untrained, so it won’t be very useful. Training it would normally require us to collect (or somehow already have on hand) a broad corpus of labeled data that is representative of the kinds of images that we’d like our model to do well on. And, let’s not forget, if there’s any hope that our model will be able to perform well across the board, this dataset of training examples must include images that come straight from the long tail. The many exotic variations of each object must somehow be represented.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe could, of course, do what Google usually does and scour the Earth, brute force, for all of the right data — labeled images of the many kinds of cars, dogs, and honey badgers in all sorts of funky poses and lighting conditions. But, let’s be real, that playbook is old news. A new playbook is to harness market forces. Instead of exhaustively turning over every last stone in search of bits, we could enlist a broader community to collect the data for us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to create a two-sided market by building the right incentive structures into our smart contract. On the supply side, people who have access to the prized bits of data can get paid if they contribute them (in labeled form) to our nascent neural net. And, on the demand side, developers who would like to leverage the intelligence of our neural net can pay a fee to make use of it as an API and get its prediction for what some unknown image contains (again “car,” “honey badger,” etc.).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce this kind of economic venue is bootstrapped and reaches critical mass, it sets off a self-reinforcing feedback loop of improvement: More capital deployed by our neural net leads to the crowdsourcing of more esoteric data, which leads to improved model accuracy, which leads to increasing demand from developers, which leads to even more capital deployed by our neural net. And around the flywheel we go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s dive into how exactly we could get this to work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[toc-embed]Solving the Cold-Start Problem\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first hard problem is getting our marketplace off the ground. Why should a willing supply side show up with data, if the demand side doesn’t already exist? And, contrariwise, why would the demand side ever pay good money for the mad ravings of an untrained neural network? The cold-start problem is the key challenge that every startup to have ever bootstrapped a multi-sided market, like Airbnb or Uber, has had to overcome. A minimum level of activation energy is required to spark the virtuous engine into motion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis initial energy must come from somewhere. Traditionally, it has always come from financial capital — venture funding that’s provided by a set of people that tends to be completely disjoint from the set of participants in the network itself. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have historically raised enormous amounts of money to subsidize one or both sides of their marketplaces with cash in order to get the flywheel started. This is capital-intensive and misses a huge opportunity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine for a second a world in which Uber had raised less money than it did and, instead of subsidizing the supply side of its new marketplace with only cash, it had also rewarded early drivers with a small amount of ownership in Uber (the company). In that world, the very first Uber drivers would no doubt appreciate the fact that their hard-earned ownership stake in Uber (albeit small, at first) could someday be worth a lot of money. Could that fact alone help persuade some of them to participate? How much more loyal would those drivers be to Uber over some of its competitors? Would they be more likely to evangelize Uber to other people? And, as Uber grew and each driver’s ownership began to be worth real money, would it inspire the next cohort of drivers to jump onboard?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no reason that the capital needed to get a multi-sided marketplace off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ccite\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fshare?text=There is no reason that the capital needed to get a multi-sided marketplace off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources.&amp;url=https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Flong-tail-problem-in-a-i\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter-share\"\u003E\u003Ci class=\"icon-twitter\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EShare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a fundamentally more efficient capital structure for a multi-sided market.

And, as the flywheel is set into motion, the service it offers will begin to become useful to the demand side too — i.e., developers willing to pay real money for its predictions. Of course, the fees that our contract charges them would have to be small at the start, but as our model’s accuracy improves, they can begin to increase. Higher fees can then be used to further incentivize data contributions which, in turn, improve the model, and so again, around the flywheel we go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key idea is that a market that is owned by its participants acts on its region of influence like a magnetic coil does on iron filings.

Such programs are called “private smart contracts,” and they are an active area of research in the space. One approach to building them is based on a kind of cryptographic proof (known as a zk-SNARK) that can mathematically convince any observer that a computation was performed correctly without revealing any of the underlying state.

The core idea behind Chris Dixon’s argument is that decentralization — and therefore crypto — matters because it addresses the problem of platform risk. History is full of countless forgotten companies that were tempted to build entirely on top of centralized platforms. For many of those companies, everything tended to look great until, like quicksand, the platform’s rules began to shift. Rules that were once generous to developers conveniently morphed into ones that are now more favorable to the platform. Along the way, entire companies have been dragged down by the undertow, often beneath the suffocating sand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is because the core protocols of the internet (i.e. TCP\u002FIP) are decentralized, that it is possible for trillion-dollar companies like Google to be built on top of them.

This might ring true: crypto is a technology that is all about building systems that are owned and controlled by diverse communities, whereas AI today is one that relies on consolidation of data and tends to supercharge a central entity’s ability to make top-down decisions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the past decade, this view has become our dominant narrative about AI. Nary a week goes by without headlines that bemoan the excesses of the concentrated power now wielded by tech giants and how it tragically undermines democracy, corrupts youths, causes reflux, etc. Much of society now seems to assume that the only way we can ever hope to wrest that power away from the likes of Google and Facebook is, ironically, through the exercise of yet another kind of centralized power—top-down and inevitably heavy-handed government regulation. The truth is, however, that it’s a monumental failure of imagination for us to believe that we are at the end of history — that not a single path forward exists for a startup to build technology that shifts the balance of power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is almost natural to think that there is something inherent to AI that lends advantages to large players — that AI is inescapably “communist.” The story that people like to tell focuses on how tech giants hoard all of our personal data and benefit from unassailable “data network effects.” But the real reason that tech giants are good at AI is actually much simpler. They are good at it because they invest in it. They have every reason to do so.

Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C\u002Fem\u003E that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces.” Human thinking somehow has the power to tell apart what is fundamental from what is merely incidental and thus can generalize to the long tail without us having to experience it directly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair, the inductive model at the heart of a deep neural network also has some power of generalization, but there’s a catch. The key inductivist assumption is that the future will resemble the past and the unseen will resemble the seen. And true, sometimes it does. More often, however, the reality is otherwise. The world is radically nonlinear. One does not simply model it with a quilt of stitched-together linear functions, for, as it turns out, the future and the unseen are often unrecognizably different from the past and the seen. As a case in point, think of the inner workings at the center of a distant star whose light began its long journey towards Earth thousands of years ago.

Ethereum is the first example of such a computer. It extended the ideas behind Bitcoin by including support for a general purpose programming language. Since then, it has unquestionably become one of the most important projects in the space.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut why is this kind of computer even useful?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is truly novel about this mode of computation is that its security and trust model emerges bottom up from its users — users who can be anyone, anywhere, and can participate without anyone’s permission. Control over this collective computer is literally decentralized. There are no gatekeepers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is, of course, that many of those users are no doubt dishonest and would rather like to game the system for profit if they could. The genius at the heart of Ethereum and Bitcoin (and crypto more generally) is a set of incentive structures that makes these systems self-policing. Through well-calibrated economic rewards, cryptonetworks like Ethereum encourage their users to keep one another in check. And so, even though they may not trust one another, they can come to trust in the decentralized computer that they are collectively helping secure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe defining property of such a computer is therefore that everyone can come to trust (and verify) that the programs that are deployed to it will indeed run and will run correctly \u003Cem\u003Eas written\u003C\u002Fem\u003E no matter what. This is why these programs have come to be known as &#8220;smart contracts.&#8221;  A better term for them, however, might be &#8220;sovereign programs&#8221; because, once deployed, they are independent — they deterministically execute themselves, instruction by instruction, subject to nobody&#8217;s authority. They run with immunity from intervention by (1) the people who originally wrote them; (2) the people who interact with them while they are running; and (3) even the people who control the physical machines that execute them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is this inviolable sovereignty that allows a smart contract to credibly act as a trusted intermediary between strangers. In fact, it is exactly this property that empowers a single program — e.g. the Bitcoin codebase — to come alive as a fully digital, global store of value. But that&#8217;s just the beginning. Smart contracts are a fundamentally new computational building block that is very general. They unlock a realm of possible applications that we have barely begun to explore. A few of them might even have something to do with A.I.!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is, in fact, a coincidence that’s worthy of good sci-fi that, as a considerable subset of humanity finds itself doggedly working toward strong AI, another subset (conveniently disjoint from the first) is set on building an unstoppable world computer.

No need to make it Skynet. Let’s instead think through a network that is dead simple — say, a classifier that accepts as input an image and produces as output a prediction of what it thinks the image contains (e.g. “car,” “dog,” “honey badger,” “the number three,” etc.).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the beginning, our model will be untrained, so it won’t be very useful. Training it would normally require us to collect (or somehow already have on hand) a broad corpus of labeled data that is representative of the kinds of images that we’d like our model to do well on. And, let’s not forget, if there’s any hope that our model will be able to perform well across the board, this dataset of training examples must include images that come straight from the long tail. The many exotic variations of each object must somehow be represented.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe could, of course, do what Google usually does and scour the Earth, brute force, for all of the right data — labeled images of the many kinds of cars, dogs, and honey badgers in all sorts of funky poses and lighting conditions. But, let’s be real, that playbook is old news. A new playbook is to harness market forces. Instead of exhaustively turning over every last stone in search of bits, we could enlist a broader community to collect the data for us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to create a two-sided market by building the right incentive structures into our smart contract. On the supply side, people who have access to the prized bits of data can get paid if they contribute them (in labeled form) to our nascent neural net. And, on the demand side, developers who would like to leverage the intelligence of our neural net can pay a fee to make use of it as an API and get its prediction for what some unknown image contains (again “car,” “honey badger,” etc.).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce this kind of economic venue is bootstrapped and reaches critical mass, it sets off a self-reinforcing feedback loop of improvement: More capital deployed by our neural net leads to the crowdsourcing of more esoteric data, which leads to improved model accuracy, which leads to increasing demand from developers, which leads to even more capital deployed by our neural net.

A minimum level of activation energy is required to spark the virtuous engine into motion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis initial energy must come from somewhere. Traditionally, it has always come from financial capital — venture funding that’s provided by a set of people that tends to be completely disjoint from the set of participants in the network itself.

Could that fact alone help persuade some of them to participate? How much more loyal would those drivers be to Uber over some of its competitors? Would they be more likely to evangelize Uber to other people?

I’ll briefly mention a few.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe must, for example, build into our smart contract a mechanism that can reliably measure signal in the data that is contributed to it. It must have logic that is capable of telling apart garbage data from the real thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA possible solution is to enable our smart contract to access a secret benchmark dataset that it can use to measure its own performance. Data contributions that improve the neural net’s accuracy on the benchmark can be rewarded, whereas those that don’t might incur a fee.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA related problem is that, because the state of all smart contracts today is visible on the blockchain to anyone who wishes to look, it would be trivial for an attacker to steal the underlying neural net (once trained) and bypass the need to pay for its predictions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solution to this whole family of problems depends on the existence of smart contracts whose execution is still verifiable by anyone, but whose internal state is encrypted. Such programs are called “private smart contracts,” and they are an active area of research in the space. One approach to building them is based on a kind of cryptographic proof (known as a zk-SNARK) that can mathematically convince any observer that a computation was performed correctly without revealing any of the underlying state. And, there are many other approaches in the works.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe challenges are formidable, but solutions are well underway.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[toc-embed]Extending the Internet\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen all is said and done, our neural network will be an autonomous entity in the world whose intelligence will have emerged from the grassroots efforts of countless individuals who are laboring independently to discover and contribute signal from wherever they may be.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe will have built a Decentralized Autonomous Hivemind — a hivemind that is true to form and, unlike the one I worked on at Google, would make the eight-year-old boy inside of me proud. And, from there, it’s but a small leap to imagine a future that includes a vast and open ecosystem of countless such hiveminds, each one brought to life by its own community and serving as a modular building block that anyone, large or small, can use to build products.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aggregate of all those building blocks can thus begin to emerge as a new protocol layer that extends the capabilities of the internet itself. It will be a fabric of intelligence that, like the internet, will be open source and controlled collectively by its own community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it is precisely because control over such a network will be decentralized that it has the potential to scale to millions of developers and contributors. No platform ever gets to that scale without making an ironclad commitment to uphold its own promises over time. And there is no better way for a platform to make that guarantee than by engraving its own rules into a sovereign program that is owned and governed by the very people who build on top of it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is, after all, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcdixon\u002Fstatus\u002F965268012621217792\"\u003EWhy Decentralization Matters\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. The core idea behind Chris Dixon’s argument is that decentralization — and therefore crypto — matters because it addresses the problem of platform risk. History is full of countless forgotten companies that were tempted to build entirely on top of centralized platforms. For many of those companies, everything tended to look great until, like quicksand, the platform’s rules began to shift. Rules that were once generous to developers conveniently morphed into ones that are now more favorable to the platform. Along the way, entire companies have been dragged down by the undertow, often beneath the suffocating sand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is because the core protocols of the internet (i.e. TCP\u002FIP) are decentralized, that it is possible for trillion-dollar companies like Google to be built on top of them. By that same token, it is inconceivable that a company the size of Google could be built on top of Google, in the same way that Google was built on top of TCP\u002FIP.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat might it be possible to build on top of a decentralized network of market-powered neural nets?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[toc-embed]The Power of Markets\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s go back to the question that we started with. Why should an approach that is driven by market forces fare any better at covering the long tail of AI than the centrally planned, somewhat “communist” efforts of a trillion-dollar tech giant? How can this new approach possibly win?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember that the challenge that forces even striding giants to slow down as they stumble headlong into the vast stretches of the long tail has less to do with blunt resources to be brought to bear than with the need to navigate problems of complex coordination. Such problems are made difficult for a central planner by the fact that the information needed to solve them is strewn about widely and locked away in countless remote places and unknown minds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe people who are best equipped to harness the various pockets of localized knowledge that these problems demand are those who are closest to those pockets, not the monolithic entity at the center that’s trying to do all of the planning and commanding top-down. So, rather than marshaling an army that searches the world over blindly, it is much more effective to instead create incentive structures that encourage individuals to self-organize.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than marshaling an army that searches the world over blindly for long-tail data, it is much more effective to instead create incentive structures that encourage individuals to self-organize.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ccite\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fshare?text=Rather than marshaling an army that searches the world over blindly for long-tail data, it is much more effective to instead create incentive structures that encourage individuals to self-organize.&amp;url=https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Flong-tail-problem-in-a-i\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter-share\"\u003E\u003Ci class=\"icon-twitter\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EShare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is true because there is simply no way that a single mind (or a small group of minds) at the center can match the endless knowledge and creativity of a diverse ecosystem of people who are all aligned with one another by the presence of a well calibrated market. Adam Smith’s “invisible hand of the market” is, after all, but a metaphor for the power of bottom-up self-organization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, the knowledge and resources that are necessary to innovate in AI are held in the pockets of giants — well beyond the reach of most individuals and startups. But, through the creation of efficient and global markets around them, they can be made more accessible. We might discover that market-based systems that are built bottom-up offer society a new approach, one that’s more disruptive to entrenched power structures, for building intelligent computer systems. The difference will be in who ends up controlling them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEach new mini-hivemind may start out modestly. But, the right set of incentives, credibly engraved into a kind of covenant whose governance is decentralized (a smart contract), has the potential to coordinate human energy at a scale that dwarfs even that of our largest giants. And so, in the end, it may turn out that AI is not so inherently communist after all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

This can lead people to dismiss them, in the same way people dismissed early smartphones because they traded off computing power and screen size for portability and new sensors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETrust is a new software primitive from which other components can be constructed. The first and most prominent example is digital money, made famous by Bitcoin. But, as we’ve discovered over the past few years, many other software components can be constructed using the building blocks of trust. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum enable the creation of, among other things, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FERC20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eapplication-specific currencies\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fethereum\u002Feips\u002Fissues\u002F721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Edigital property rights\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fethereum\u002FEIPs\u002Fissues\u002F1068\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eopen financial instruments\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fdavesag\u002FERC884-reference-implementation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Esoftware-based organizations\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom these components, in turn, new infrastructure and applications can be constructed.

Recent developments in artificial intelligence are extremely exciting and will enable computers to more intelligently interact with the world. We believe that just as the last three megatrends &#8212; mobile, social, and cloud &#8212; intersected and reinforced each other, so will the next three megatrends &#8212; next-gen computing devices, AI, and crypto.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the Bitcoin whitepaper is now almost 10 years old, we believe we are still early in the crypto movement.
