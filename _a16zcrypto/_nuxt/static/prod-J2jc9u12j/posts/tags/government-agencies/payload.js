Given that the SEC does not consider crypto trading platforms to be “regulated markets,” this functionally means that ETPs can only exist for those crypto assets that have futures markets (regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) which have demonstratively high predictive price discovery of the underlying commodity. This approach overlooks the significant size and transparency of current crypto markets. More importantly, it creates an arbitrary distinction in the standards applicable to crypto-based ETP listing applications and all other commodity-based listing applications.

But it does mean that we have to do the hard work of understanding how to staunch the flow of illicit crypto activity. The good news is that thanks to the transparency and auditability of most blockchain transactions, blockchain analytics firms and law enforcement agencies have already done much of this hard work. We know, for instance, that the bulk of illicit financial activity in the crypto ecosystem moves through just a handful of exchanges in jurisdictions with weak or non-existent anti-money laundering regimes. We also know that this activity is performed by foreign actors who typically cannot be reached through existing U.S. enforcement mechanisms. For this reason, introducing laws that would attempt to regulate peer-to-peer transactions between private individuals in the same way we regulate banks and other financial intermediaries would ultimately not address the core issues. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo what should the U.S. government do instead?

An explicit grant of extraterritorial jurisdiction would make it crystal clear that Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) can regulate foreign transactions that impact U.S. markets. OFAC could then take action against entities that have established relationships with U.S. businesses that operate abroad, or those that provide services to U.S. residents. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis change could prevent virtual asset service providers and covered digital asset platforms from locating abroad and engaging in jurisdictional arbitrage to avoid regulations.

It would allow authorities to pursue bad foreign actors more aggressively.

Law enforcement became more effective once specialized cyber forensic tools became broadly available, and when their employees were trained to use them.

More specifically, this rule usually requires that advisers place client assets (funds and securities) with a “qualified custodian” (often a bank or broker-dealer), and that an independent public accountant periodically verify the assets. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EUnfortunately, regulatory uncertainty in this area  frustrates even the most compliance-minded asset manager. Only a handful of clearly qualified crypto custodians operate in the U.S. – and these few qualified custodians service only a limited number of crypto assets.

More specifically, this rule usually requires that advisers place client assets (funds and securities) with a “qualified custodian” (often a bank or broker-dealer), and that an independent public accountant periodically verify the assets. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EUnfortunately, regulatory uncertainty in this area  frustrates even the most compliance-minded asset manager. Only a handful of clearly qualified crypto custodians operate in the U.S. – and these few qualified custodians service only a limited number of crypto assets. Notably, when one of these qualified custodians provides crypto custodial services, their services seldom extend to staking, voting or other participatory features of crypto assets.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EResponsible investment advisers who manage crypto assets have, when possible, already been staking assets for years on other blockchains. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThough digital assets as a whole are often considered risky investments, there’s an argument to be made that avoiding crypto staking abdicates  an obligation to clients.

In the U.S., securities can be sold only if they are registered with the SEC or if they qualify for an exemption from registration.

Simply put, “accredited” investors (meaning rich people or institutions such as university endowments and foundations) can purchase unregistered securities from the issuer via a set of rules known as 506(b) or 506(c) under Regulation D. In effect, the securities laws enable such so-called “sophisticated” buyers and sellers to transact without the SEC’s formal intervention, presuming that each party can protect itself without the need for an extra set of SEC-prescribed disclosure statements. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe most obvious example of this is a venture capital firm investing in a Series A offering for Company X. The firm does its diligence, enters into a set of legal contracts with Company X that defines the firm’s rights and restrictions, wires money to Company X and thus is able to purchase a security known as a Series A preferred stock. That’s the typical process for the private sale of unregistered securities from a company to an investor. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhat happens, however, if some time in the future the venture firm wants to sell its shares in Company X? Under the SEC’s well-established rules, the firm can sell unregistered securities under Rule 144, which allows public resale of restricted and controlled securities if a number of conditions are met. But it basically says that if an investor has held the securities for 6-12 months — the time period depends on whether the company is publicly reporting and whether one is an “affiliate” of the company (a fancy way of saying board member or substantial shareholder) — then that investor is generally free to sell the stock to another sophisticated investor or into the public market if the company’s shares are publicly traded.      \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo why does this matter?\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis is a commonplace and well-settled law from the 1970s, and as a result, the rule has been a significant factor in the rise of the venture capital industry that has led to some of the most important companies, in turn \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2017\u002F06\u002F19\u002Fipos\u002F\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Eresulting\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E in jobs creation, economic growth, and more.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut the SEC case against Telegram appears to ignore this legal precedent. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EInstead, the SEC said in their original complaint that the private, institutional investors who entered into the Telegram purchase agreement (which was sold privately as a security under the appropriate regulatory statutes) did so with the intention of distributing the tokens to unsuspecting investors (“unloading it on the unadvised public”) — rather than through the orderly sale of securities to accredited investors as outlined in the SEC’s own Reg.

In the U.S., securities can be sold only if they are registered with the SEC or if they qualify for an exemption from registration.

Simply put, “accredited” investors (meaning rich people or institutions such as university endowments and foundations) can purchase unregistered securities from the issuer via a set of rules known as 506(b) or 506(c) under Regulation D. In effect, the securities laws enable such so-called “sophisticated” buyers and sellers to transact without the SEC’s formal intervention, presuming that each party can protect itself without the need for an extra set of SEC-prescribed disclosure statements. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe most obvious example of this is a venture capital firm investing in a Series A offering for Company X.

But it basically says that if an investor has held the securities for 6-12 months — the time period depends on whether the company is publicly reporting and whether one is an “affiliate” of the company (a fancy way of saying board member or substantial shareholder) — then that investor is generally free to sell the stock to another sophisticated investor or into the public market if the company’s shares are publicly traded.      \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESo why does this matter?\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis is a commonplace and well-settled law from the 1970s, and as a result, the rule has been a significant factor in the rise of the venture capital industry that has led to some of the most important companies, in turn \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2017\u002F06\u002F19\u002Fipos\u002F\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Eresulting\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E in jobs creation, economic growth, and more.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut the SEC case against Telegram appears to ignore this legal precedent. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EInstead, the SEC said in their original complaint that the private, institutional investors who entered into the Telegram purchase agreement (which was sold privately as a security under the appropriate regulatory statutes) did so with the intention of distributing the tokens to unsuspecting investors (“unloading it on the unadvised public”) — rather than through the orderly sale of securities to accredited investors as outlined in the SEC’s own Reg.

Last week, the SEC filed an action to enjoin Telegram (creators of the Telegram Open Network, or “TON”) from distributing tokens (called “Grams”) that it had promised to purchasers of a prior investment contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the week prior, the SEC entered into settlement agreements with two crypto companies &#8212; Block.one (creators of the EOSIO software that was the basis for the EOS blockchainmaker of EOS) and Nebulous (creators of SiaFunds and SiaCoins). Block.one and Nebulous acknowledged that each had violated the U.S. securities laws by raising capital without registering those securities or relying upon an exemption from registration. Block.one was assessed a $24 million fine by the SEC (less than 1% of the $4 billion it had raised in the offering); Nebulous was fined $225,000, twice the amount it has raised. The Telegram action was not a settlement, but rather an action by the SEC to prevent Telegram from distributing what the SEC deemed “securities”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing on the wrong side of an SEC injunctive or enforcement action is not cause for celebration; but, in this case, there may at least be a silver lining. For, despite the seriousness of these violations, these actions are very revealing about the regulatory landscape for crypto projects more generally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut first, a quick recap.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe’ve \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2018\u002F05\u002F04\u002Fconsiderations-for-regulating-cryptonetworks\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Ewritten about this previously\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, but the key regulatory question overhanging crypto has been whether crypto tokens are securities under the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E test, and suggested a framework for thinking about the characterization of a token based upon the \u003Cem\u003Elifecycle\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of a token. In the pre-network phase, the token sponsor may raise capital to fund the development of a network. This is exactly what Telegram, Block.one and Nebulous did: marketed a pre-network token to purchasers, the proceeds of which were intended to permit Telegram to build out TON, Nebulous to build out the ultimate crypto network for its file sharing services and for Block.one to build out a basis for a fully distributed network necessary for a proof of stake protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the SEC found in its settlement orders with Block.one and Nebulous, this sale of pre-network tokens was in fact a sale of securities: Purchasers invested money with an expectation of profit, which expectation relied on Block.one and Nebulous (the concerted effort of “others”) to in fact build and launch the network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was not a surprising finding from the SEC, but rather consistent with its other enforcement actions. Nonetheless, for companies and practitioners in the space, these settlement orders underscore the application of \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to pre-network capital raises. Any capital raising efforts at this stage need to either comply with securities law registration requirements or be subject to an exemption from the securities laws.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImportantly, and distinct from the Telegram offering, Block.one and Nebulous raised money from unaccredited investors (these are investors are deemed “unsophisticated” because they don’t have a lot of money). Sales of unregistered securities to unaccredited are generally illegal in the U.S. (save some minor exceptions under the post-JOBS Act crowdsourcing rules); thus, the SEC’s findings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the Telegram case, however, Telegram sold to “sophisticated” investors through an exemption to the securities laws. Thus, the question for the SEC in this case was not whether the initial sale of the investment contract to these investors was permissible (unlike in the Block.one and Nebulous cases), but rather whether Telegram’s planned distribution of Grams to these purchasers was permissible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, therein is where the SEC actions provide some interesting insight &#8212; not for what the SEC in fact did, but rather for what the SEC did not do!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe agency didn’t require that Block.one or Nebulous shut down its or any related crypto networks. That is, while the SEC fined the organizations for the fundraising activities each had conducted in violation of the securities laws, it did not conclude that the ongoing operations of the respective networks violated the securities laws. In fact, it’s possible that the SEC viewed the launch of the EOS mainnet as independent of Block.one’s ERC-20 token sale, providing evidence of EOS mainnet’s decentralized and distributed structure and consistent with the SEC’s focus on decentralization. And the Nebulous waiver letter notes the level of activity and usage of Siacoin.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does this matter?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June 2018, SEC Corporate Finance Director Hinman \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fnews\u002Fspeech\u002Fspeech-hinman-061418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eoutlined his views on\u003C\u002Fa\u003E the application of \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to crypto networks. He introduced the concept of “mutability” &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Ethat a token could be a security under some circumstances, but then change into a non-security in other circumstances\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. As noted above, in the pre-network stage, tokens will generally be characterized as securities in light of the “reliance on the efforts of others” prong of the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E test. However, post-network launch &#8212; provided that the network is sufficiently decentralized &#8212; the nature of the token can change from security to non-security, owing to the fact that the holder of the token is no longer relying on the efforts of others (i.e., the corporation that may have originally launched the token). Rather, the success or failure of the token is reliant upon the value of the token as determined by the decentralized community versus a centralized and coordinated corporation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this speech is more than a year old, many in the industry did not know what to make of the probative value of the speech: was this simply a framework offered by Hinman or reflective of the stance the SEC would take when faced with mutable tokens?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe of course already knew that the SEC deemed Bitcoin and Ethereum as sufficiently decentralized so as not to be securities, but the SEC had never opined formally on the mutability question with regards to Ethereum. There has never been an enforcement action related to the original capital raising efforts that Ethereum did many years ago, so we didn’t have any official view from the SEC as to whether Ethereum had once been a security, but no longer was.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Block.one and Nebulous settlements now shed \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C\u002Fem\u003E light on that important question.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the SEC determined that Block.one’s ERC-20 token (the token sold in the offering that is the subject of the SEC’s Order) and Siafunds were “securities”, in neither case did the SEC’s actions address EOS or Siacoins. Had the SEC determined that EOS and Siacoins were still “securities”, we would have likely seen the SEC force the sponsors to cease and desist from allowing their respective tokens to trade. After all, securities cannot be traded other than through registered exchanges or under exemptions from the securities laws, neither of which is present in the EOS and Siacoins situations. Instead, the SEC fined the sponsors for their pre-network capital raising activities, but permitted them to continue the operation of the related networks. Thus, the concept of mutability may have some foundation at the SEC.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it’s important to recognize that \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F05\u002F15\u002Fkik-and-the-sec-whats-going-on-and-what-does-it-mean-for-crypto\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Esettlements are very fact-specific and do not necessarily provide\u003C\u002Fa\u003E precedential value for other sponsors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, we know from the Block.one settlement, that the SEC’s decision was likely informed by the significant efforts that Block.one had taken post-capital raise to ensure that compliance and regulatory matters were first class citizens. Block.one also undertook specific efforts to attempt to exclude U.S. purchasers from the offering; the SEC may have viewed this favorably. We also know that the original purchasers from whom money was raised received ERC-20 tokens, but such tokens have effectively been retired and purchasers later received a separate EOS token. Thus, it’s not technically the case that the original ERC-20 tokens (which were securities) converted into EOS tokens (which are now deemed non-securities).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, just because the SEC didn’t shut down the current trading of EOS tokens, it doesn’t automatically follow that they don’t deem them securities. Rather, the regulatory purview of the SEC &#8212; like most administrative agencies &#8212; \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F05\u002F15\u002Fkik-and-the-sec-whats-going-on-and-what-does-it-mean-for-crypto\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eenables them to act by\u003C\u002Fa\u003E negotiated settlement with a counterparty or by deciding to take that counterparty to court to see whether they can convince a judge to sanction a counterparty. It’s possible that the SEC determined that this was the best settlement it could achieve in the most expedient way, while avoiding the costs, time and vagaries of going to court.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImportantly, the SEC’s injunctive relief action against Telegram is also consistent with the above reading of the two settlement actions. As we mentioned previously, there is no dispute among either the SEC or Telegram as to the nature of the original capital raising process; Telegram sold an investment contract to sophisticated investors to enable them to use the proceeds of that offering to build TON. But, as of October 31, Telegram was intending to distribute Grams to these purchasers; the question now became whether the original investment contract (a security under \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E) had morphed from a security to something else based on the nature of TON’s operational status.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn support of its injunction motion, the SEC pointed to a few salient facts about TON\u002FGrams: (i) the TON foundation, while operational, is controlled by the Telegram founders and thus not independent (or “distributed” in crypto terms) of Telegram and (ii) TON itself is not really operational (thus, we don’t have a “functioning network” in crypto terms) and (iii) although there are some lock-up provisions that restrict resale of some of the Grams that purchasers will be delivered, there is no utility in the network such that purchasers can really only sell their Grams for a potential profit versus utilizing them for some non-investment like function in TON.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, the SEC argues (these are my words, not theirs) that there aren’t sufficient conditions to support mutability. We still have purchasers who continue to rely on the concerted efforts of others (because TON is not functional nor decentralized) with a primary expectation (or at least motivation) of profit versus utility.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt appears from the SEC’s application for injunctive relief that its primary concern was the fact that some of the Grams holders would be able to sell their holdings (post-October 31) for investment purposes. From the SEC’s \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Flitigation\u002Fcomplaints\u002F2019\u002Fcomp-pr2019-212.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eapplication\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: “Once Grams reach the public markets, it will be virtually impossible to unwind the Offering, given that many purchasers’ identities will be shrouded in secrecy, and given the variety of unregulated markets where Grams may be sold, including platforms that promise anonymity and encryption capability to mask transactions.” Although not explicitly addressed by the SEC, this statement raises the question as to how the SEC might have felt about the distribution of Grams had there been a functioning network in which Grams holders might have been able to participate.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, given all of that, what do these SEC actions offer in terms of the regulatory framework in which crypto networks operate:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPre-network capital raises will be deemed securities &#8212; we knew this before, but now really know this! Either sell an investment contract to only accredited investors or register the securities with the SEC &#8212; those are the options.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBut, the nature of a pre-network security may change to a post-network non-security if the network is sufficiently decentralized such that purchasers are no longer primarily relying on the coordinated efforts of others. We still don’t know precisely what the tipping point is for what “decentralized” means. Future enforcement actions or guidance from the SEC will be required to get more clarity, as this determination is at the sole discretion of the SEC.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAnd, while every analysis is fact specific, a sponsor’s activities to take regulatory compliance seriously does matter.

Last week, the SEC filed an action to enjoin Telegram (creators of the Telegram Open Network, or “TON”) from distributing tokens (called “Grams”) that it had promised to purchasers of a prior investment contract.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the week prior, the SEC entered into settlement agreements with two crypto companies &#8212; Block.one (creators of the EOSIO software that was the basis for the EOS blockchainmaker of EOS) and Nebulous (creators of SiaFunds and SiaCoins). Block.one and Nebulous acknowledged that each had violated the U.S. securities laws by raising capital without registering those securities or relying upon an exemption from registration. Block.one was assessed a $24 million fine by the SEC (less than 1% of the $4 billion it had raised in the offering); Nebulous was fined $225,000, twice the amount it has raised. The Telegram action was not a settlement, but rather an action by the SEC to prevent Telegram from distributing what the SEC deemed “securities”.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing on the wrong side of an SEC injunctive or enforcement action is not cause for celebration; but, in this case, there may at least be a silver lining. For, despite the seriousness of these violations, these actions are very revealing about the regulatory landscape for crypto projects more generally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut first, a quick recap.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe’ve \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2018\u002F05\u002F04\u002Fconsiderations-for-regulating-cryptonetworks\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Ewritten about this previously\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, but the key regulatory question overhanging crypto has been whether crypto tokens are securities under the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E test, and suggested a framework for thinking about the characterization of a token based upon the \u003Cem\u003Elifecycle\u003C\u002Fem\u003E of a token. In the pre-network phase, the token sponsor may raise capital to fund the development of a network. This is exactly what Telegram, Block.one and Nebulous did: marketed a pre-network token to purchasers, the proceeds of which were intended to permit Telegram to build out TON, Nebulous to build out the ultimate crypto network for its file sharing services and for Block.one to build out a basis for a fully distributed network necessary for a proof of stake protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the SEC found in its settlement orders with Block.one and Nebulous, this sale of pre-network tokens was in fact a sale of securities: Purchasers invested money with an expectation of profit, which expectation relied on Block.one and Nebulous (the concerted effort of “others”) to in fact build and launch the network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was not a surprising finding from the SEC, but rather consistent with its other enforcement actions. Nonetheless, for companies and practitioners in the space, these settlement orders underscore the application of \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to pre-network capital raises. Any capital raising efforts at this stage need to either comply with securities law registration requirements or be subject to an exemption from the securities laws.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImportantly, and distinct from the Telegram offering, Block.one and Nebulous raised money from unaccredited investors (these are investors are deemed “unsophisticated” because they don’t have a lot of money). Sales of unregistered securities to unaccredited are generally illegal in the U.S. (save some minor exceptions under the post-JOBS Act crowdsourcing rules); thus, the SEC’s findings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the Telegram case, however, Telegram sold to “sophisticated” investors through an exemption to the securities laws. Thus, the question for the SEC in this case was not whether the initial sale of the investment contract to these investors was permissible (unlike in the Block.one and Nebulous cases), but rather whether Telegram’s planned distribution of Grams to these purchasers was permissible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, therein is where the SEC actions provide some interesting insight &#8212; not for what the SEC in fact did, but rather for what the SEC did not do!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe agency didn’t require that Block.one or Nebulous shut down its or any related crypto networks. That is, while the SEC fined the organizations for the fundraising activities each had conducted in violation of the securities laws, it did not conclude that the ongoing operations of the respective networks violated the securities laws. In fact, it’s possible that the SEC viewed the launch of the EOS mainnet as independent of Block.one’s ERC-20 token sale, providing evidence of EOS mainnet’s decentralized and distributed structure and consistent with the SEC’s focus on decentralization. And the Nebulous waiver letter notes the level of activity and usage of Siacoin.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does this matter?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June 2018, SEC Corporate Finance Director Hinman \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Fnews\u002Fspeech\u002Fspeech-hinman-061418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eoutlined his views on\u003C\u002Fa\u003E the application of \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E to crypto networks. He introduced the concept of “mutability” &#8212; \u003Cem\u003Ethat a token could be a security under some circumstances, but then change into a non-security in other circumstances\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. As noted above, in the pre-network stage, tokens will generally be characterized as securities in light of the “reliance on the efforts of others” prong of the \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E test. However, post-network launch &#8212; provided that the network is sufficiently decentralized &#8212; the nature of the token can change from security to non-security, owing to the fact that the holder of the token is no longer relying on the efforts of others (i.e., the corporation that may have originally launched the token). Rather, the success or failure of the token is reliant upon the value of the token as determined by the decentralized community versus a centralized and coordinated corporation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this speech is more than a year old, many in the industry did not know what to make of the probative value of the speech: was this simply a framework offered by Hinman or reflective of the stance the SEC would take when faced with mutable tokens?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe of course already knew that the SEC deemed Bitcoin and Ethereum as sufficiently decentralized so as not to be securities, but the SEC had never opined formally on the mutability question with regards to Ethereum. There has never been an enforcement action related to the original capital raising efforts that Ethereum did many years ago, so we didn’t have any official view from the SEC as to whether Ethereum had once been a security, but no longer was.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Block.one and Nebulous settlements now shed \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C\u002Fem\u003E light on that important question.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the SEC determined that Block.one’s ERC-20 token (the token sold in the offering that is the subject of the SEC’s Order) and Siafunds were “securities”, in neither case did the SEC’s actions address EOS or Siacoins. Had the SEC determined that EOS and Siacoins were still “securities”, we would have likely seen the SEC force the sponsors to cease and desist from allowing their respective tokens to trade. After all, securities cannot be traded other than through registered exchanges or under exemptions from the securities laws, neither of which is present in the EOS and Siacoins situations. Instead, the SEC fined the sponsors for their pre-network capital raising activities, but permitted them to continue the operation of the related networks. Thus, the concept of mutability may have some foundation at the SEC.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it’s important to recognize that \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F05\u002F15\u002Fkik-and-the-sec-whats-going-on-and-what-does-it-mean-for-crypto\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Esettlements are very fact-specific and do not necessarily provide\u003C\u002Fa\u003E precedential value for other sponsors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, we know from the Block.one settlement, that the SEC’s decision was likely informed by the significant efforts that Block.one had taken post-capital raise to ensure that compliance and regulatory matters were first class citizens. Block.one also undertook specific efforts to attempt to exclude U.S. purchasers from the offering; the SEC may have viewed this favorably. We also know that the original purchasers from whom money was raised received ERC-20 tokens, but such tokens have effectively been retired and purchasers later received a separate EOS token. Thus, it’s not technically the case that the original ERC-20 tokens (which were securities) converted into EOS tokens (which are now deemed non-securities).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, just because the SEC didn’t shut down the current trading of EOS tokens, it doesn’t automatically follow that they don’t deem them securities. Rather, the regulatory purview of the SEC &#8212; like most administrative agencies &#8212; \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002F2019\u002F05\u002F15\u002Fkik-and-the-sec-whats-going-on-and-what-does-it-mean-for-crypto\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eenables them to act by\u003C\u002Fa\u003E negotiated settlement with a counterparty or by deciding to take that counterparty to court to see whether they can convince a judge to sanction a counterparty. It’s possible that the SEC determined that this was the best settlement it could achieve in the most expedient way, while avoiding the costs, time and vagaries of going to court.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImportantly, the SEC’s injunctive relief action against Telegram is also consistent with the above reading of the two settlement actions. As we mentioned previously, there is no dispute among either the SEC or Telegram as to the nature of the original capital raising process; Telegram sold an investment contract to sophisticated investors to enable them to use the proceeds of that offering to build TON. But, as of October 31, Telegram was intending to distribute Grams to these purchasers; the question now became whether the original investment contract (a security under \u003Cem\u003EHowey\u003C\u002Fem\u003E) had morphed from a security to something else based on the nature of TON’s operational status.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn support of its injunction motion, the SEC pointed to a few salient facts about TON\u002FGrams: (i) the TON foundation, while operational, is controlled by the Telegram founders and thus not independent (or “distributed” in crypto terms) of Telegram and (ii) TON itself is not really operational (thus, we don’t have a “functioning network” in crypto terms) and (iii) although there are some lock-up provisions that restrict resale of some of the Grams that purchasers will be delivered, there is no utility in the network such that purchasers can really only sell their Grams for a potential profit versus utilizing them for some non-investment like function in TON.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, the SEC argues (these are my words, not theirs) that there aren’t sufficient conditions to support mutability. We still have purchasers who continue to rely on the concerted efforts of others (because TON is not functional nor decentralized) with a primary expectation (or at least motivation) of profit versus utility.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt appears from the SEC’s application for injunctive relief that its primary concern was the fact that some of the Grams holders would be able to sell their holdings (post-October 31) for investment purposes. From the SEC’s \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sec.gov\u002Flitigation\u002Fcomplaints\u002F2019\u002Fcomp-pr2019-212.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eapplication\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: “Once Grams reach the public markets, it will be virtually impossible to unwind the Offering, given that many purchasers’ identities will be shrouded in secrecy, and given the variety of unregulated markets where Grams may be sold, including platforms that promise anonymity and encryption capability to mask transactions.” Although not explicitly addressed by the SEC, this statement raises the question as to how the SEC might have felt about the distribution of Grams had there been a functioning network in which Grams holders might have been able to participate.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, given all of that, what do these SEC actions offer in terms of the regulatory framework in which crypto networks operate:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPre-network capital raises will be deemed securities &#8212; we knew this before, but now really know this! Either sell an investment contract to only accredited investors or register the securities with the SEC &#8212; those are the options.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBut, the nature of a pre-network security may change to a post-network non-security if the network is sufficiently decentralized such that purchasers are no longer primarily relying on the coordinated efforts of others. We still don’t know precisely what the tipping point is for what “decentralized” means. Future enforcement actions or guidance from the SEC will be required to get more clarity, as this determination is at the sole discretion of the SEC.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAnd, while every analysis is fact specific, a sponsor’s activities to take regulatory compliance seriously does matter. The SEC acknowledges the presence of these efforts in the Block.one case and bemoans the absence of them in the Telegram action.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile reading the tea leaves is never perfect, the SEC’s actions here are helpful in providing some additional clarity to crypto network providers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

So what should a 21st century regulator look like? Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Christopher Giancarlo (more about him below) shared the following remarks on how the CFTC has been evolving and crafting a modern regulatory approach at the inaugural a16z Crypto Regulatory Summit &#8212; which brought together leading crypto experts and builders, other technologists, academics, industry executives, and government officials along with forward-thinking regulators to foster collaboration and the exchange of ideas. What are the &#8220;formula&#8221; or four key elements\u002F mindsets involved, how might they inform regulators, and what should entrepreneurs do as a result?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGood Morning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’d like to talk to you about the tension between the current FinTech revolution and our existing financial regulatory structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you know, the digitization of information that took place in the last decades of the 20th century occurred in a regulatory “light” zone of the US Constitution’s protection of speech.  Conversely, the current, early 21st century digitization of finance is taking place in a regulatory “heavy” zone of the long-established authority of U.S. state and federal governments to protect consumers of financial services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, the practices that guided the digitization of information (and that you are all familiar with, such as “don’t ask permission, ask forgiveness”) will not work, as we have seen with initial coin offerings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet, regulation and regulators need to adapt and not be an impenetrable barrier to the current wave of fintech innovation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, I want to explain the four-part model for regulatory adaptation to fintech innovation that we have successfully deployed at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut first, some personal background. I spent a decade and a half practicing law in New York and in London in the 80s and 90s.  And in 2001, I teamed up with a group of entrepreneurs, and we built the world&#8217;s first hybrid electronic trading platform for over-the-counter derivatives. We raised three rounds of private equity. We built trading platforms in 18 financial centers around the world. And in 2005, we took our company public and had one of the most successful IPOs and follow-on offerings of that period of time. And we were doing fintech before anybody had even an idea what fintech was, very successfully, I might add.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008, we had emerged into the world&#8217;s largest trading platform for a type of a derivative traded over the counter called, “credit default swaps”. You may have heard of them &#8211; played a role in the financial crisis. And I want to tell you a story about that, that tells you about a little bit of the junction of markets, regulation and technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn September of 2008, on a Wednesday afternoon, three days before Lehman Brothers failed, I got a call from a senior official of the New York Federal Reserve. And he said to me, &#8220;We&#8217;ve met before, right?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Remind me what you guys do again.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;We&#8217;re the world&#8217;s largest platform for trading credit default swaps.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Right, that&#8217;s what I thought you did.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Now, what are you seeing in the markets?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s pandemonium. It&#8217;s absolute crisis conditions in the markets.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well, what does that mean? Does it mean things aren&#8217;t trading?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;No. What it means is, the price of getting protection against the default of one major Wall Street bank against another major Wall Street bank is going through the roof. Credit default swaps are priced as a spread to the expected survivability of Treasury securities. And the spreads we&#8217;re now running in hundreds of basis points above.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich meant that the marketplace perceived that the likelihood of failure, of not just Lehman Brothers, but JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, was also very great. So we knew, the marketplace knew of the crisis. But the major regulator, the New York Federal Reserve, was calling around to platforms like us, asking, &#8220;What do you guys do, again?

Do you have time to come around the Federal Reserve and talk to us about this?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, gosh, it is such a crazy day.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But maybe by 8:00 or 9:00 tonight, I&#8217;ll get off the floor and come over and visit with you.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Oh, no, no, I&#8217;m way too busy.&#8221; He says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time. Look in your calendar. Maybe sometime in October, we can get together.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Boy, in October, I may have plenty of time to sit down with you and talk about this because it may all be over.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo realizations in that experience. One is, that there needed to be a regulatory intervention in this unregulated over-the-counter market. It just was not acceptable that in a crisis, regulators had to make phone calls around to understand what was going on in the market. But two, there needed to be a data and technology intervention in this market. It was perceived at the time, in September of 2008, the amount of credit default swaps protection written against Lehman Brothers was $400 billion, or thereabouts. But they didn&#8217;t know for sure. And if you multiply that across every Wall Street bank, you will get an idea of what would happen if any bank failed, with that much exposure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we now know, that if you took all of that exposure on Lehman Brothers, that $400 billion and netted it down, longs against shorts, collateralization, the total exposure would have been less than $9 billion, if Lehman Brothers failed. If we knew in 2008, that the failure of Lehman Brothers was a $9 billion exposure, the regulatory response could have been entirely different.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, that would have been a decision for the officials then. But certainly, $9 billion is a number the federal government could have guaranteed, and we could have a very different financial situation. The lack of visibility into counterparty credit exposure was at the root of the crisis. Why is that relevant? Because if all of that exposure had been on a blockchain, we would have known in real time, immediately, that it wasn&#8217;t $400 billion, that it was $9 billion. So, a tremendous amount of technology and market intelligence needs to come into the regulatory scheme. And it turns the conversation on its head. Just listening to Mark, interestingly, he was talking about why does the United States need to make sure innovation happens here? I take that even further and say, we, regulators, need fintech innovation to happen here and be available to us to change the dynamic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI became an advocate for the core reforms that made its way into Title VII of Dodd Frank, which are the reforms of the swaps market. And in 2013, I was honored by President Obama to serve on the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In 2017, President Trump named me as Chairman of the agency. And what I&#8217;ve observed over the last five years, is this phase of innovation that we&#8217;re in, this phase of fintech innovation is unlike ones that came before, because when the innovation came into the information space [in the late 20th century], it came into a regulatory light-touch environment because of our First Amendment, because information, and opinion, and speech is largely unregulated. But this level of innovation is entirely different. This round of innovation is coming smack dab into a brick wall of a heavily regulated space &#8212; financial services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs my colleague, Dan Gorfine says, &#8220;Whenever you&#8217;re talking about people&#8217;s money, you&#8217;re talking about regulation.&#8221; Every Congressman and Congresswoman and every Senator has a concern about the sanctity of the money and savings of their constituents. And this is a new phase of “innovation meets regulation” &#8212; and a very different one than before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me tell you a number of reasons why:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENumber one, the exponential rate of change, the exponential rate of innovation, the exponential rate of adoption, is totally alien to a political and regulatory system that was built and purposely designed to be impervious to change. Our founders didn&#8217;t trust political power and they built a system that is very difficult to change. Our system is intended to change very, very slowly.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESecondly, our system of regulation is one that is favorable to intermediation. If you think about the way regulators approach an ecosystem to regulate it, they look at the ecosystem and they say, &#8220;Okay, who are the intermediaries? Let&#8217;s register them. Let&#8217;s authorize them. Let&#8217;s confirm them. And let&#8217;s give them authority in the space.&#8221; Whether they be banks, exchanges, clearing houses. They&#8217;re all authorized, they have responsibilities. Regulators seek to intermediate spaces, whereas innovators seek to disintermediate and decentralize systems. So, this is another large conflict.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAnother difference is, these new fintech protocols are brand new, whereas regulatory protocols go back to the 1930s. The securities laws were written in the 1930s, our Commodity Exchange Act was written in the 1930s. So, you have a lot of inherent conflict between innovation and financial regulation.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what have we tried to do with the CFTC to change some of that dynamic? We try to do four things at the CFTC and we like to think that they&#8217;re perhaps a model for what other regulators in Washington and abroad can be doing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we&#8217;ve sought to adopt an exponential growth mindset. That is a mindset throughout our agency, expecting that the rate of innovation and the rate of market adoption of new technologies will be in line with Moore&#8217;s Law, that is grown exponentially faster all the time. And we&#8217;ve tried to adopt that same mindset in how we go about things. Now, part of that is in the CFTC’s DNA as an agency because we&#8217;re a principles-based, not a rules-based regulator. But we&#8217;ve tried to take that even further. So I&#8217;m very proud to say that several of my CFTC staff colleagues are with us today and one of my fellow Commissioners, Rostin Behnam.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re here. Why? Because if you&#8217;re going to have an exponential setup mindset, you&#8217;ve got to be learning. You&#8217;ve got to be with innovators. You&#8217;ve got to be understanding what&#8217;s going on. As an agency, we try to flood the zone of learning, of understanding.  We can only regulate effectively, if we understand and anticipate the potential disruption to our regulatory framework.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, we&#8217;ve built an internal stakeholder at the CFTC to represent innovation within our agency, and it&#8217;s called Lab CFTC. Daniel Gorfine is head of Lab CFTC. It&#8217;s not a sandbox, as Mr. Osborne described, it&#8217;s a laboratory, because we&#8217;re a principles-based regulator, because we have certain tools like “no action relief.” We don&#8217;t believe we need a sandbox and say, “That company, no, not you, that company over there, you can go into our sandbox and innovate.” We don’t pick winners and losers. That&#8217;s not our approach. Our approach is, how do we look at our rule set on a principles basis and apply it across the board, to perhaps all innovation, without having to pick winners and losers? And I don&#8217;t mean to take anything away from the British approach. I think it&#8217;s been very formative, but we have a different approach.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELab CFTC has done over 250 separate interactions with innovators, not just in Washington. In fact, we launched Lab CFTC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, not in Washington, D.C. It was a bipartisan effort. It was formed by myself and a former Democrat Commissioner, with full support across the aisle. So, there&#8217;s nothing partisan about it. It is entered into collaboration agreements with the UK FCA, with the Singapore MAS, with the Australian regulator. And it really has become a model, I think, for this type of approach that other U.S. regulators are taking. And also, it&#8217;s our internal disruptor. We need to be set back on our heels internally from time to time, to open ourselves to new innovation, and that&#8217;s the job of Lab CFTC.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so an exponential growth mindset, an internal stakeholder. Third, we have a quantitative growth mindset. We want to be a quantitative regulator, which I have described at length elsewhere.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd fourth, and I&#8217;ll end with this is (because I am out of time), we&#8217;re very focused on looking at markets to guide us as to where do we go forward. We&#8217;re a believer in markets. We believe that as regulators, we don&#8217;t want to make moral judgments on the value of innovation. We want to use market forces to do that. And when we were approached with Bitcoin futures two years ago, we received some resistance, both in Washington and around the globe, that we were going to allow this new innovation. But we really believed that the presence of Bitcoin futures would do its part to bring the value of Bitcoin into a real market basis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what I&#8217;ll end with is, we had watched Bitcoin break away from its fundamentals, in terms of its cost to production, and a bubble emerged. And it was the launch of Bitcoin futures on December 17th of 2017, that did more than anything else to bring Bitcoin back into its fundamentals. And we think that&#8217;s healthy in the long run. The worst thing you want is regulation written in a crisis or upon the popping of a bubble.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I&#8217;m out of time. It&#8217;s been a pleasure to be here with you today. Thank you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJ.

So what should a 21st century regulator look like? Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Christopher Giancarlo (more about him below) shared the following remarks on how the CFTC has been evolving and crafting a modern regulatory approach at the inaugural a16z Crypto Regulatory Summit &#8212; which brought together leading crypto experts and builders, other technologists, academics, industry executives, and government officials along with forward-thinking regulators to foster collaboration and the exchange of ideas. What are the &#8220;formula&#8221; or four key elements\u002F mindsets involved, how might they inform regulators, and what should entrepreneurs do as a result?\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGood Morning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI’d like to talk to you about the tension between the current FinTech revolution and our existing financial regulatory structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you know, the digitization of information that took place in the last decades of the 20th century occurred in a regulatory “light” zone of the US Constitution’s protection of speech.  Conversely, the current, early 21st century digitization of finance is taking place in a regulatory “heavy” zone of the long-established authority of U.S. state and federal governments to protect consumers of financial services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, the practices that guided the digitization of information (and that you are all familiar with, such as “don’t ask permission, ask forgiveness”) will not work, as we have seen with initial coin offerings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet, regulation and regulators need to adapt and not be an impenetrable barrier to the current wave of fintech innovation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, I want to explain the four-part model for regulatory adaptation to fintech innovation that we have successfully deployed at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut first, some personal background. I spent a decade and a half practicing law in New York and in London in the 80s and 90s.  And in 2001, I teamed up with a group of entrepreneurs, and we built the world&#8217;s first hybrid electronic trading platform for over-the-counter derivatives. We raised three rounds of private equity. We built trading platforms in 18 financial centers around the world. And in 2005, we took our company public and had one of the most successful IPOs and follow-on offerings of that period of time. And we were doing fintech before anybody had even an idea what fintech was, very successfully, I might add.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008, we had emerged into the world&#8217;s largest trading platform for a type of a derivative traded over the counter called, “credit default swaps”. You may have heard of them &#8211; played a role in the financial crisis. And I want to tell you a story about that, that tells you about a little bit of the junction of markets, regulation and technology.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn September of 2008, on a Wednesday afternoon, three days before Lehman Brothers failed, I got a call from a senior official of the New York Federal Reserve. And he said to me, &#8220;We&#8217;ve met before, right?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Remind me what you guys do again.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;We&#8217;re the world&#8217;s largest platform for trading credit default swaps.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Right, that&#8217;s what I thought you did.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Now, what are you seeing in the markets?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s pandemonium. It&#8217;s absolute crisis conditions in the markets.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well, what does that mean? Does it mean things aren&#8217;t trading?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;No. What it means is, the price of getting protection against the default of one major Wall Street bank against another major Wall Street bank is going through the roof. Credit default swaps are priced as a spread to the expected survivability of Treasury securities. And the spreads we&#8217;re now running in hundreds of basis points above.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich meant that the marketplace perceived that the likelihood of failure, of not just Lehman Brothers, but JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, was also very great. So we knew, the marketplace knew of the crisis. But the major regulator, the New York Federal Reserve, was calling around to platforms like us, asking, &#8220;What do you guys do, again? And what is the market telling us about what&#8217;s happening?&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI explained to him what&#8217;s happening and he said to me: &#8220;That is really interesting. I&#8217;d really like to understand that a lot better. Do you have time to come around the Federal Reserve and talk to us about this?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, gosh, it is such a crazy day.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But maybe by 8:00 or 9:00 tonight, I&#8217;ll get off the floor and come over and visit with you.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Oh, no, no, I&#8217;m way too busy.&#8221; He says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time. Look in your calendar. Maybe sometime in October, we can get together.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Boy, in October, I may have plenty of time to sit down with you and talk about this because it may all be over.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo realizations in that experience.

And we&#8217;ve tried to adopt that same mindset in how we go about things. Now, part of that is in the CFTC’s DNA as an agency because we&#8217;re a principles-based, not a rules-based regulator. But we&#8217;ve tried to take that even further. So I&#8217;m very proud to say that several of my CFTC staff colleagues are with us today and one of my fellow Commissioners, Rostin Behnam.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe&#8217;re here. Why? Because if you&#8217;re going to have an exponential setup mindset, you&#8217;ve got to be learning. You&#8217;ve got to be with innovators. You&#8217;ve got to be understanding what&#8217;s going on. As an agency, we try to flood the zone of learning, of understanding.  We can only regulate effectively, if we understand and anticipate the potential disruption to our regulatory framework.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, we&#8217;ve built an internal stakeholder at the CFTC to represent innovation within our agency, and it&#8217;s called Lab CFTC. Daniel Gorfine is head of Lab CFTC. It&#8217;s not a sandbox, as Mr. Osborne described, it&#8217;s a laboratory, because we&#8217;re a principles-based regulator, because we have certain tools like “no action relief.” We don&#8217;t believe we need a sandbox and say, “That company, no, not you, that company over there, you can go into our sandbox and innovate.” We don’t pick winners and losers. That&#8217;s not our approach. Our approach is, how do we look at our rule set on a principles basis and apply it across the board, to perhaps all innovation, without having to pick winners and losers? And I don&#8217;t mean to take anything away from the British approach. I think it&#8217;s been very formative, but we have a different approach.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELab CFTC has done over 250 separate interactions with innovators, not just in Washington. In fact, we launched Lab CFTC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, not in Washington, D.C. It was a bipartisan effort. It was formed by myself and a former Democrat Commissioner, with full support across the aisle. So, there&#8217;s nothing partisan about it. It is entered into collaboration agreements with the UK FCA, with the Singapore MAS, with the Australian regulator. And it really has become a model, I think, for this type of approach that other U.S. regulators are taking. And also, it&#8217;s our internal disruptor. We need to be set back on our heels internally from time to time, to open ourselves to new innovation, and that&#8217;s the job of Lab CFTC.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so an exponential growth mindset, an internal stakeholder. Third, we have a quantitative growth mindset. We want to be a quantitative regulator, which I have described at length elsewhere.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd fourth, and I&#8217;ll end with this is (because I am out of time), we&#8217;re very focused on looking at markets to guide us as to where do we go forward. We&#8217;re a believer in markets. We believe that as regulators, we don&#8217;t want to make moral judgments on the value of innovation. We want to use market forces to do that. And when we were approached with Bitcoin futures two years ago, we received some resistance, both in Washington and around the globe, that we were going to allow this new innovation. But we really believed that the presence of Bitcoin futures would do its part to bring the value of Bitcoin into a real market basis.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what I&#8217;ll end with is, we had watched Bitcoin break away from its fundamentals, in terms of its cost to production, and a bubble emerged. And it was the launch of Bitcoin futures on December 17th of 2017, that did more than anything else to bring Bitcoin back into its fundamentals. And we think that&#8217;s healthy in the long run. The worst thing you want is regulation written in a crisis or upon the popping of a bubble.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I&#8217;m out of time. It&#8217;s been a pleasure to be here with you today. Thank you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJ.

In its Wells response, Kik tells a good story about consumptive uses, given its integration with the messenger platform, which had millions of users at the time of the token sale. Apparently, 20% of Kin purchasers linked their wallets to Kik to buy everything from games to digital products and services.
