This failure leads the group to advocate for regulating things like decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) in exactly the same way, without nuance. The opposing faction argues, in contrast, for the complete exclusion of web3 from existing regulations.

This is why, throughout the history of the Internet, governments have always chosen to regulate apps such as email providers (e.g., Gmail) and not to regulate underlying protocols such as email (e.g., Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or “SMTP”). Potentially subjective, globally-conflicting regulations thwart the ability of protocols to interoperate and function autonomously, rendering them useless.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ERegulating apps, not protocols has served the public interest well over the past decades of the Internet’s explosive growth. While the propagation of web3 technology adds a layer of complexity to the challenge of regulating the Internet, a web3 app regulatory framework does not need to address illicit activity at the protocol level. We do not regulate SMTP just because email can facilitate illicit activity. But proposals for web3 regulatory frameworks must be capable of accomplishing policy objectives by reducing the risk of illicit activity, providing strong consumer protection and removing incentives that run counter to policy objectives — this can be done most effectively at the app level.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWe believe such a framework for the regulation of web3 apps should focus on three interrelated factors: \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFirst, the \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cb\u003Epolicy objectives\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E of an intended regulation must be assessed.

This can be because a given piece of regulation outlives its original purpose, because it applies too broadly beyond its intended purpose, because it creates unintended negative effects, or because applying such regulation would negate the value of the technology it seeks to regulate.

In the world of CeFi, many regulations are designed to remove the risk of trusting financial intermediaries. The goal is to reduce the risks that may arise whenever there is potential for conflicts of interest or outright fraud, which are almost always present when one person has to trust another with their money or assets. (See: FTX, Celsius, Voyager, 3AC, MF Global, Revco, Fannie Mae, Lehman Brothers, AIG, LTCM, and Bernie Madoff.) In the world of DeFi, where traditional financial services are disintermediated, there are no intermediaries to trust. So, in true DeFi, the decentralization, transparency, and trustlessness enabled by blockchain technology eliminates much of the risk that many CeFi regulations are primarily intended to address. By removing the need to trust and rely on intermediaries, DeFi can insulate users from many of the age-old acts of malfeasance prevalent in CeFi and do so better than any ‘self-regulatory’ or ‘public regulatory’ regime in CeFi ever could. In other words, it makes no sense to apply the “red flag acts” of CeFi to DeFi, or:\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003E\n\u003Cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003Ecan’t be evil &gt; don’t be evil\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&mdash; cdixon.eth (@cdixon) \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcdixon\u002Fstatus\u002F1470223992757927936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003EDecember 13, 2021\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cscript async src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fplatform.twitter.com\u002Fwidgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fscript\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAs a result, the whole-sale application of CeFi regulations to decentralized web3 apps that do not provide intermediary-like services would be illogical. Moreover, any regulatory intervention would be counterproductive.

Consider the difference between “broker-dealer” (BD) regulations under U.S. securities laws and “introducing broker” (IB) regulations under U.S. commodity derivatives laws, for instance. One purpose of the BD laws is to protect investors from risks inherent to intermediaries who take custody of investor assets. This differs from the scope of IB laws, through which the CFTC focuses on how conflicts of interest could lead to intermediaries affecting trading without ever taking custody of investor assets. The decentralization of web3 technology clearly obviates the need for the custodial aspects of BD laws, but alone it may not obviate the need for IB laws, particularly where a DeFi app makes determinations (such as routing trades) on behalf of users.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ENow consider regulations restricting how securities and derivatives can be offered and sold in the United States. These regulations have many purposes, some of which are not obviated by decentralization or web3 technology, including those that relate to investor protection. Where the same risks and considerations apply to centralized and decentralized businesses and technologies, the default position will likely be that the rules should be consistent absent some overriding policy objective that justifies different rules. For instance, it may be difficult to argue that a centralized business (such as a centralized exchange like Coinbase) should be prohibited from earning commissions on trades of securities and derivatives, but that another business facilitating access to decentralized infrastructure (such as a for-profit website providing access to a decentralized exchange protocol like Uniswap) should be allowed to earn commissions on those same types of trades. Such a regulatory framework could give businesses using decentralized protocols a significant competitive advantage over centralized exchanges and would lead to regulatory arbitrage. As a result, such differences in approach would need to be justified by a compelling policy objective, such as to promote decentralized innovation (as we discuss further below).\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe foregoing examples are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the wide array of regulations that could apply to web3 apps.

Taxonomy and classification questions like the ones above are the analytical floor: how DeFi works must be understood at a granular level.

For example, many web3 apps may not be entirely trustless, for instance, because they take custody of user assets, intermediate user’s transactions, and\u002For market or advertise certain assets, products, or services to users. Apps with these characteristics are the most likely to require regulation since they are more likely to introduce legacy centralization risks to users or, if left unregulated, to run counter to policy objectives. Beyond characteristics that introduce centralization risks, two important characteristics of web3 apps also have regulatory implications where web3 technology doesn’t obviate a regulation’s purpose. These are (1) whether the app is operated by a business \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cb\u003Efor profit \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Eand (2) whether the app’s intended \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cb\u003Eprimary purpose \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Eis to facilitate the activity to be regulated (i.e., whether the primary purpose is lawful or unlawful).

First, the very fact that the app is operated by a business for profit could subject users to certain risks. For instance, if such an app were to facilitate certain types of financial transactions, the operator’s profiting off of such transactions could create inherent conflict of interests. Second, if the regulation did not apply and failed to prohibit a business from profiting from the facilitation of the illicit activity the regulation was intended to prevent, then such regulation would effectively be incentivizing the facilitation of such illicit activity and would likely lead to an increase in such activity. For example, permitting businesses to charge commissions on unlawful trading of tokenized securities or derivatives would likely lead to an increase in such unlawful trading, which would be counterproductive to the policy objectives behind such regulation (to reduce the prevalence of such trading). \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cftc.gov\u002FPressRoom\u002FSpeechesTestimony\u002Fopaquintenz19a\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAiding and abetting laws\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E use this argument as a central tenet.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ENotwithstanding the foregoing, a more flexible regulatory approach for web3 apps that are operated for profit may be justifiable due to the benefits that web3 technology delivers. In particular, because the decentralized protocols of web3 add to the native functionality of the Internet and can be used by anyone, they effectively serve as public infrastructure (similar to SMTP\u002Femail). A flexible regulatory approach to web3 apps operated for-profit could drive growth of these protocols, increasing development and even empowering developers to self-fund such progress through the operation of for-profit apps. Conversely, significantly burdensome regulatory barriers to entry or regulatory economies of scale would be detrimental to this technology reaching its full future potential. Requiring developers to register under an overly burdensome regime or obtain a costly, time consuming license in order to deploy a frontend website providing access to a decentralized protocol could have a stifling effect on web3 innovation in the United States. As a result, there are strong public policy arguments in favor of shielding web3 apps in their nascent stages from cumbersome regulation in order to incentivize the development and availability of web3 infrastructure in the United States.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhere web3 apps are not operated by a business for profit, the case for leniency is even more compelling.

These web3 apps likely don’t raise the same concerns outlined above because, if no one is profiting, then there are fewer or no incentives creating conflicts of interest or encouraging operators to facilitate illicit activity. As discussed above, the goal of any web3 app regulatory framework should be to reduce the risk of and disincentivize illicit activity, not eliminate the possibility of it occurring.

In fact, many such apps could potentially already be subject to regulation on this basis, even if they are just frontend websites that display information from blockchains and assist users in communicating with such blockchains.

In particular, the decentralized nature of the protocol and the characteristics of the app may eliminate many or all of the risks intended to be addressed by such regulation (per the prior section) and the potential societal benefits from empowering the Internet with unencumbered exchange functionality may significantly outweigh any lingering policy objectives that gave rise to such regulation.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFinally, regardless of whether a web3 app is operated for profit and whether its primary purpose is lawful, all apps should continue to be subject to certain existing legal frameworks and many apps should become subject to new narrowly-tailored customer protection requirements.

But enforcement actions against protocol or app operators who had no involvement with malicious activity violates fundamental notions of due process and justice. Second, consumer protection regulations like disclosure requirements could help to inform users of the risks of using a specific DeFi protocol, and code audit requirements could protect an app’s users against smart contract failures of an underlying protocol.

Regardless, however sure these constitutional challenges may appear, their strength remains uncertain. It would therefore be foolish for web3 industry actors to refuse to engage in the shaping of policy or to reject all regulation on the basis that the Constitution will protect web3, as that protection may not end up materializing. Web3 industry actors must engage with policy makers and regulators to shape regulatory policy, and only rely on the courts to uphold constitutional rights against specific overreaches later.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EGiven the potential for constitutional challenges, web3 regulation needs to be carefully and deliberately crafted.

It requires a reassessment of existing regulatory schemes, a deep understanding of web3 technology, and a delicate balancing of policy objectives. Undertaking these tasks is of critical importance. If web3 apps remain soulbound to pre-existing regulatory frameworks applicable to traditional businesses without any room for reevaluation and technical nuance, the evolution of the Internet in the United States will be halted dead in its tracks. Outdated “red flag acts” must be re-thought and new regulations must be implemented to meet policy objectives.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThat process must begin with the establishment of clear policy objectives for web3. Critically, these objectives need to be calibrated properly so that the societal benefits created by web3 technology far exceed its costs. That does not require the elimination of the possibility that web3 technology may be used for illicit activity, but it does require measures designed to reduce the risk of and disincentivize illicit activity. Subsequent installments of this series will explore how further disincentivization of illicit activity can be accomplished, along with other important web3 policy-related topics, including a discussion of specific regulatory schemes, the differences between apps and protocols and the importance of U.S. leadership.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EUltimately, harnessing web3 technology and its ability to transfer value at the speed of the Internet will result in the addition of many new forms of native internet functionality and give rise to millions of new internet businesses.  However, doing so \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Enecessitates that we apply regulation carefully to support innovation and limit the creation of unnecessary gatekeepers.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E To accomplish this, policy makers, regulators, and web3 participants should continue to engage in respectful, open, good-intentioned, and deliberate discourse.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEdited by Robert Hackett, with special thanks to the exceedingly thoughtful advice, feedback, and edits from many members of the web3 community\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
