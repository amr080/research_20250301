To do so, a DAO could seek to throttle incentives for clients that exceed a predetermined client dominance threshold (such as 50% of user transactions). In order to avoid the manipulation of a mechanism like this to censor certain clients, such mechanisms should be as autonomous as possible, with upper and lower bounds on the client dominance thresholds. For instance, for Blockzaar, such a mechanism could only be triggered if a client exceeds 50% of transaction volume, which would result in its commission allocation being reduced from 1.4% to 1.0% – with the 0.4% difference accruing to the protocol.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EFour guidelines for designing Machiavellian DAOs\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that we understand the interplay between protocol stakeholders and the protocol’s incentive structure, a protocol’s DAO can be designed to implement four guidelines developed \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fmachiavelli-principles-dao-decentralized-governance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efrom Machiavellian principles\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E","\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Machiavellians believed that organizations tend towards autocratic leadership, and that such leadership will ultimately discriminate to perpetuate its own privileges and power.
