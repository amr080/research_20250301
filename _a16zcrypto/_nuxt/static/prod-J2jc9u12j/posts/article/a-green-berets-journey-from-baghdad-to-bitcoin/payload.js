I want to take you to my hometown of Tucson, Arizona, where I grew up. And I was still in high school when the 9\u002F11 attacks happened, and that was the day that actually changed the course of my life, because it was on that day that I made the decision to join the U.S. Army.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, four generations before me had all served in the military.

We experienced ambushes, IEDs, where seven of them were actually wounded. But for all the intensity of the combat, the centerpiece of our strategy was actually not fighting, because we were waging a counterinsurgency. And in a counterinsurgency, the key terrain is the hearts and minds of the people. And the insurgents take advantage of and ride a wave of social and economic grievances, often legitimate.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we were to win, we had to address those grievances. And so, for as much time as we&#8217;ve spent doing combat patrols, we spent even more time trying to develop the local economy. In particular, we wanted to improve the lot of one group of people, which were the farmers that lived there in this province where we were. Afghanistan, or at least this area, was an agrarian economy. It consisted of subsistence farming, where a single failed harvest could result in devastation for not just a single family, but for an entire community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe wanted to address that problem. And so an idea we came up with for our program to run was called crop diversification. For crop diversification, we would subsidize farmers to essentially diversify the crops they grew year over year. And that meant less frequent crop failures because more healthy soil. It meant less intense effects for any family or the overall community.

One day I decided to kind of dig a little bit deeper, and I ended up reading the Bitcoin white paper.

Any record when added to the blockchain can&#8217;t be changed after the fact. This makes it ideal for a system of tracking property ownership.

Any transaction posted to a public blockchain can be traced from start to finish along every intermediate step. Applied to Iraq, this means that the sender of military aid, which in this case was the U.S., would have been able to trace along the whole path that that aid took and ensure that it got to its intended recipient.
