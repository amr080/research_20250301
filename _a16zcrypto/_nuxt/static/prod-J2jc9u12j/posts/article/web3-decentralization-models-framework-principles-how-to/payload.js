In order to achieve this, web3 systems need to vest meaningful power, control, and ownership to system stakeholders (via airdrops, other token distributions, decentralized governance, etc.). This in turn encourages stakeholders to contribute meaningful value, because they have agency over how their contributions are treated and rewarded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ongoing balancing of incentives among the stakeholders &#8212; developers, contributors, and consumers &#8212; can then drive further contributions of value to the overall system, to the benefit of all.

In this piece, I focus primarily on U.S. securities laws, which dictate how and whether web3 systems may make use of their own native digital assets. While there is no codified standard of “legal decentralization,” a first-principles analysis of U.S. securities laws, case law, and SEC guidance (including the SEC’s definitive guidance from April 2019) can help us formulate a practical standard.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, U.S. securities laws are generally intended to create a “level playing field” for securities transactions by limiting the ability of those with more information from taking advantage of others with less information. This is the principle of \u003Cstrong\u003Einformation asymmetry\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, and U.S. securities laws typically seek to eliminate asymmetry in certain securities transactions by applying disclosure requirements. The principle plays a role in the \u003Cem\u003EHowey \u003C\u002Fem\u003Etest, the subjective test that determines whether U.S. securities laws should apply to a digital assets transaction where there is (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profit (4) primarily based upon the managerial efforts of others. The fourth prong seeks to address information asymmetry on the basis of the belief that where there is a reliance on “managerial efforts”, the risk of information asymmetry (of the managers versus outsiders) is likely high, and therefore the application of securities laws may be necessary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the above and SEC guidance, we can surmise that if a web3 system can (a) eliminate the potential for significant information asymmetries to arise and (b) eliminate reliance on essential managerial efforts of others to drive the success or failure of that enterprise, then the system \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C\u002Fem\u003E be “sufficiently decentralized” such that the application of U.S. securities laws to its digital assets shouldn’t be necessary. For purposes of this piece, I refer to these systems as being \u003Cstrong\u003Elegally decentralized\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Admittedly, the legal decentralization threshold will not be capable of being met by most businesses, but as I outline below, the novel components of web3 systems uniquely position them to meet such a threshold.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECollectively, these three separate aspects of decentralization &#8212; technical, economic, legal &#8212; must be viewed holistically, as a single design challenge, because design decisions with respect to one will affect another.

With the client\u002F website open source, third parties that are independent from the developer company often end up hosting their own clients\u002F websites providing access to the same underlying protocol.

The decentralization of clients within DeFi is somewhat straightforward given their relative simplicity &#8212; very little incentivization is necessary to get third parties to build independent and simple gateways (mostly in the form of websites) to such protocols. However, as web3 products and services become increasingly complex, with computationally expensive\u002F resource-intensive client layers built on top of underlying smart contract protocols, the decentralization of the client becomes more complicated.

In more complex web3 systems, we would expect to see the prevalence of such awards increase significantly. For example, in a decentralized social media ecosystem, a client’s user engagement could be measured and rewarded via tokens. Finally, in addition to incentives from the protocol, the operators of clients would be incentivized by any financial returns they are able to generate through their own proprietary clients.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilders seeking to decentralize their web3 systems via the open decentralization model will need to design their incentive mechanisms and their decentralized governance models to be “client agnostic” to encourage participation by many actors.

If such imbalances could easily occur, then the builders of these clients could view the web3 system unfavorably and be less willing to invest their time and resources in it.

Types of tokenization protocols include serial NFT-minting projects, digital asset marketplaces, and protocols that tokenize real-world assets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe open decentralization model below reflects:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eassets\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E brought on-chain from multiple providers through a shared smart contract protocol;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ethe \u003Cstrong\u003Esmart contract protocol\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E tokenizing such assets;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ethe sale or use of such\u003Cstrong\u003E tokenized assets\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E through multiple clients;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Enative \u003Cstrong\u003Edigital asset distributions\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E and incentivization mechanisms; and\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ethe launching of \u003Cstrong\u003EDAO governance\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E with respect to the community intellectual property and DAO treasury.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5193 size-full\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002F\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F04\u002Fweb3decentralizationmodelfortokenizationprotocols_milesjennings_a16zcrypto-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"web3 decentralization model for tokenization protocols\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1571\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this model, economic decentralization is achieved through sufficient diversity of inputs (asset providers) and outputs (asset acquirors), as well as the decentralization of the layers through which the tokenized assets flow (the blockchain, the smart contracts, and the clients).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe protocol’s DAO could also use \u003Cstrong\u003Eexplicit incentives\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (fungible token awards, no commissions\u002F fees, etc.) to:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eincentivize asset providers to provide assets to the system;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eincentivize clients to make a market in the tokenized assets; and\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eincentivize acquirors to acquire such assets or to consume them.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the initial developer company may initially play a significant part in any of these roles (asset provider, client operator, asset acquiror), once the system is decentralized, the developer company would eventually be just one of many actors in any given role. This would limit the risk of any significant information asymmetries accruing to it and reduce the reliance on its managerial efforts. In addition, many roles could be undertaken by the DAO and\u002F or subDAOs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver time, the explicit incentives could also be adjusted to account for potential shortfalls on either the supply side or the demand side. In a decentralized marketplace for instance, token incentives to sellers (the supply side) could be increased to bring more goods for sale onto the platform; and token incentives to buyers (the demand side) could be increased to encourage more purchases.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom a legal decentralization perspective, the key questions, yet again, would be: Are the essential managerial efforts of any third party necessary to drive the success or failure of the web3 system? And would there be the potential for significant information asymmetries to arise? The answer to both questions depends on whether the DAO could effectively manage its incentives to balance supply and demand as in the example above &#8212; but more broadly, it’s really about preventing any single asset provider, asset acquiror, or client from becoming so important that the success of the entire system relies on any one entity’s efforts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor additional models and use cases, as well as more details relating to the above models, please see the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16z.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F04\u002Fprinciples-and-models-of-decentralization_miles-jennings_a16zcrypto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Efull paper\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E* * * \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilders of web3 systems currently face numerous challenges in initiating, managing, and scaling decentralization. But the framing of decentralization as a single design challenge with three aspects &#8212; technical, economic, and legal &#8212; should provide a strong reference guide to help builders as they use the novel components of web3 systems to overcome these challenges, even as regulatory requirements may shift.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFailure to account for all three of these elements will lead us to a web3 that falls short of the future that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies make possible. No one wants a “web3“ that’s built on new tech, but that is otherwise indistinguishable from web2. Instead, by building systems that carefully and deliberately design for decentralization, builders can create digital infrastructure, and give life to decentralized economies, which will form the foundation of the internet for decades to come.
