crypto","\u003Cp\u003EIn the past decade, our progress in Artificial Intelligence has been staggering. We’ve gone from barely detecting cats in YouTube videos to building cars that can drive themselves. And yet, as our aspirations for AI have become grander, it has slowly become a game that only tech giants can play. The knowledge and resources that are necessary to innovate in the space are now simply out of reach for most individuals and startups. How can we change that? The only answer is to build new technology that levels the playing field.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA common refrain in 2018 was “AI is communist; crypto is libertarian.” It was said first by Peter Thiel as a tongue-in-cheek observation that, while crypto is a technology movement that strives to decentralize power, AI is another that can’t seem to help but centralize it. This might ring true: crypto is a technology that is all about building systems that are owned and controlled by diverse communities, whereas AI today is one that relies on consolidation of data and tends to supercharge a central entity’s ability to make top-down decisions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the past decade, this view has become our dominant narrative about AI. Nary a week goes by without headlines that bemoan the excesses of the concentrated power now wielded by tech giants and how it tragically undermines democracy, corrupts youths, causes reflux, etc. Much of society now seems to assume that the only way we can ever hope to wrest that power away from the likes of Google and Facebook is, ironically, through the exercise of yet another kind of centralized power—top-down and inevitably heavy-handed government regulation. The truth is, however, that it’s a monumental failure of imagination for us to believe that we are at the end of history — that not a single path forward exists for a startup to build technology that shifts the balance of power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is almost natural to think that there is something inherent to AI that lends advantages to large players — that AI is inescapably “communist.” The story that people like to tell focuses on how tech giants hoard all of our personal data and benefit from unassailable “data network effects.” But the real reason that tech giants are good at AI is actually much simpler. They are good at it because they invest in it. They have every reason to do so. For tech giants, AI is a technology that enhances existing lines of business — in the words of Clay Christensen, it’s a sustaining innovation, not a disruptive one.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd true, there is no denying that having a lot of data does in fact lend giants an advantage. Large datasets of training examples are still a crucial input to even our most data-efficient Machine Learning algorithms, and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. But nonetheless, at the very foundation of tech giants’ towering strength in AI, there exists an almost invisible hairline crack.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is now an opportunity for startups to coordinate human energy at an unprecedented scale by building technology that better harnesses market forces.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ccite\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fshare?text=There is now an opportunity for startups to coordinate human energy at an unprecedented scale by building technology that better harnesses market forces.&amp;url=https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Flong-tail-problem-in-a-i\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter-share\"\u003E\u003Ci class=\"icon-twitter\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EShare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding AI systems today is increasingly a problem of coordinating large-scale and widespread data-collection efforts.

Our work was part of a broader strategy to gain a data advantage by harnessing one of Google’s core strengths — its ability to build large-scale systems. We set out to enable a collection of robots, each learning independently from its own environment, to contribute their real-time experience to a central neural network whose job it was to inform the actions of all the robots.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, we wanted to build a hivemind.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo test it, we set up a door-opening challenge. Could our hivemind learn to correctly set the motor voltages for the seven joints of each robot such that each of them would successfully open the unique door that stood in front of it?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might think, as I did, that getting a robot to open a door would have been easy. And, you’d be right — it is easy if you’re doing it for a specific door under specific conditions. But, to this day, it’s a hard problem to solve for all doors under all possible circumstances. This is because there is a very long tail of variations (edge cases) in the most mundane things — things like lighting and shadows; the color, texture, and reflectivity of the handle; the weight of the door; the type of handle; the forces required to operate it; and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there is one lesson that I took home from that experience, it’s that almost all AI problems worth solving are made difficult by the challenge of the long tail — a challenge that can only be tackled with lots of data. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fali01\u002Fstatus\u002F1138803418594570241\"\u003EI wrote all about that here\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem of the long tail is the hairline crack at the foundation of today’s AI power structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ccite\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fshare?text=The problem of the long tail is the hairline crack at the foundation of today’s AI power structure.&amp;url=https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Flong-tail-problem-in-a-i\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter-share\"\u003E\u003Ci class=\"icon-twitter\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EShare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem of the long tail is the hairline crack at the foundation of today’s AI power structure.

They stitch together thousands of linear functions, laboriously shifting each one slightly for each training example, into a kind of high dimensional quilt — a manifold — that fits the training set. In doing so, they cannot help but make predictions by inductively pattern-matching onto what they’ve seen happen before. They mirror (rather than explain, as humans do) the chaos and complexity of the phenomena they observe.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENeural networks arrive at their predictions by induction, not deduction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis helps explain why today’s deep neural networks require so much data to learn anything useful: They are inductive interpolators and, as such, they require a large number of points between which they can do their interpolating.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is it that our progress toward solving hard AI problems slows down as soon as we enter the realm of edge cases?

Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C\u002Fem\u003E that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces.” Human thinking somehow has the power to tell apart what is fundamental from what is merely incidental and thus can generalize to the long tail without us having to experience it directly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair, the inductive model at the heart of a deep neural network also has some power of generalization, but there’s a catch. The key inductivist assumption is that the future will resemble the past and the unseen will resemble the seen. And true, sometimes it does. More often, however, the reality is otherwise. The world is radically nonlinear. One does not simply model it with a quilt of stitched-together linear functions, for, as it turns out, the future and the unseen are often unrecognizably different from the past and the seen. As a case in point, think of the inner workings at the center of a distant star whose light began its long journey towards Earth thousands of years ago.

The darkness of that realm, for a neural network, can be illuminated only by direct experience with it — real training examples drawn from the long tail itself that can help mold the network&#8217;s linear predilections into better fitting nonlinear ones. But, of course, those training examples are, by definition, outliers and the hardest to come across.

The very term “decentralization” in the space refers to a class of power structures whose balance is tilted in favor of communities instead of central points of control.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tools for decentralization that crypto has brought to bear have led us to build a kind of logical &#8220;world computer.&#8221; It is made up of a distributed network of physical machines that are owned and operated by members of a broad community. Ethereum is the first example of such a computer. It extended the ideas behind Bitcoin by including support for a general purpose programming language. Since then, it has unquestionably become one of the most important projects in the space.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut why is this kind of computer even useful?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is truly novel about this mode of computation is that its security and trust model emerges bottom up from its users — users who can be anyone, anywhere, and can participate without anyone’s permission. Control over this collective computer is literally decentralized. There are no gatekeepers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is, of course, that many of those users are no doubt dishonest and would rather like to game the system for profit if they could. The genius at the heart of Ethereum and Bitcoin (and crypto more generally) is a set of incentive structures that makes these systems self-policing. Through well-calibrated economic rewards, cryptonetworks like Ethereum encourage their users to keep one another in check. And so, even though they may not trust one another, they can come to trust in the decentralized computer that they are collectively helping secure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe defining property of such a computer is therefore that everyone can come to trust (and verify) that the programs that are deployed to it will indeed run and will run correctly \u003Cem\u003Eas written\u003C\u002Fem\u003E no matter what. This is why these programs have come to be known as &#8220;smart contracts.&#8221;  A better term for them, however, might be &#8220;sovereign programs&#8221; because, once deployed, they are independent — they deterministically execute themselves, instruction by instruction, subject to nobody&#8217;s authority. They run with immunity from intervention by (1) the people who originally wrote them; (2) the people who interact with them while they are running; and (3) even the people who control the physical machines that execute them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is this inviolable sovereignty that allows a smart contract to credibly act as a trusted intermediary between strangers. In fact, it is exactly this property that empowers a single program — e.g. the Bitcoin codebase — to come alive as a fully digital, global store of value. But that&#8217;s just the beginning. Smart contracts are a fundamentally new computational building block that is very general. They unlock a realm of possible applications that we have barely begun to explore. A few of them might even have something to do with A.I.!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is, in fact, a coincidence that’s worthy of good sci-fi that, as a considerable subset of humanity finds itself doggedly working toward strong AI, another subset (conveniently disjoint from the first) is set on building an unstoppable world computer.

No need to make it Skynet. Let’s instead think through a network that is dead simple — say, a classifier that accepts as input an image and produces as output a prediction of what it thinks the image contains (e.g. “car,” “dog,” “honey badger,” “the number three,” etc.).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the beginning, our model will be untrained, so it won’t be very useful. Training it would normally require us to collect (or somehow already have on hand) a broad corpus of labeled data that is representative of the kinds of images that we’d like our model to do well on. And, let’s not forget, if there’s any hope that our model will be able to perform well across the board, this dataset of training examples must include images that come straight from the long tail. The many exotic variations of each object must somehow be represented.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe could, of course, do what Google usually does and scour the Earth, brute force, for all of the right data — labeled images of the many kinds of cars, dogs, and honey badgers in all sorts of funky poses and lighting conditions. But, let’s be real, that playbook is old news. A new playbook is to harness market forces. Instead of exhaustively turning over every last stone in search of bits, we could enlist a broader community to collect the data for us.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to create a two-sided market by building the right incentive structures into our smart contract. On the supply side, people who have access to the prized bits of data can get paid if they contribute them (in labeled form) to our nascent neural net. And, on the demand side, developers who would like to leverage the intelligence of our neural net can pay a fee to make use of it as an API and get its prediction for what some unknown image contains (again “car,” “honey badger,” etc.).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce this kind of economic venue is bootstrapped and reaches critical mass, it sets off a self-reinforcing feedback loop of improvement: More capital deployed by our neural net leads to the crowdsourcing of more esoteric data, which leads to improved model accuracy, which leads to increasing demand from developers, which leads to even more capital deployed by our neural net. And around the flywheel we go.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s dive into how exactly we could get this to work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E","\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first hard problem is getting our marketplace off the ground. Why should a willing supply side show up with data, if the demand side doesn’t already exist? And, contrariwise, why would the demand side ever pay good money for the mad ravings of an untrained neural network? The cold-start problem is the key challenge that every startup to have ever bootstrapped a multi-sided market, like Airbnb or Uber, has had to overcome. A minimum level of activation energy is required to spark the virtuous engine into motion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis initial energy must come from somewhere. Traditionally, it has always come from financial capital — venture funding that’s provided by a set of people that tends to be completely disjoint from the set of participants in the network itself. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have historically raised enormous amounts of money to subsidize one or both sides of their marketplaces with cash in order to get the flywheel started. This is capital-intensive and misses a huge opportunity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine for a second a world in which Uber had raised less money than it did and, instead of subsidizing the supply side of its new marketplace with only cash, it had also rewarded early drivers with a small amount of ownership in Uber (the company). In that world, the very first Uber drivers would no doubt appreciate the fact that their hard-earned ownership stake in Uber (albeit small, at first) could someday be worth a lot of money. Could that fact alone help persuade some of them to participate? How much more loyal would those drivers be to Uber over some of its competitors? Would they be more likely to evangelize Uber to other people? And, as Uber grew and each driver’s ownership began to be worth real money, would it inspire the next cohort of drivers to jump onboard?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no reason that the capital needed to get a multi-sided marketplace off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ccite\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fshare?text=There is no reason that the capital needed to get a multi-sided marketplace off the ground has to be entirely financial in nature and come from external sources.&amp;url=https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Flong-tail-problem-in-a-i\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter-share\"\u003E\u003Ci class=\"icon-twitter\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EShare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a fundamentally more efficient capital structure for a multi-sided market.

Of course, the fees that our contract charges them would have to be small at the start, but as our model’s accuracy improves, they can begin to increase.

For many of those companies, everything tended to look great until, like quicksand, the platform’s rules began to shift. Rules that were once generous to developers conveniently morphed into ones that are now more favorable to the platform. Along the way, entire companies have been dragged down by the undertow, often beneath the suffocating sand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is because the core protocols of the internet (i.e. TCP\u002FIP) are decentralized, that it is possible for trillion-dollar companies like Google to be built on top of them. By that same token, it is inconceivable that a company the size of Google could be built on top of Google, in the same way that Google was built on top of TCP\u002FIP.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat might it be possible to build on top of a decentralized network of market-powered neural nets?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E","\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s go back to the question that we started with. Why should an approach that is driven by market forces fare any better at covering the long tail of AI than the centrally planned, somewhat “communist” efforts of a trillion-dollar tech giant? How can this new approach possibly win?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember that the challenge that forces even striding giants to slow down as they stumble headlong into the vast stretches of the long tail has less to do with blunt resources to be brought to bear than with the need to navigate problems of complex coordination. Such problems are made difficult for a central planner by the fact that the information needed to solve them is strewn about widely and locked away in countless remote places and unknown minds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe people who are best equipped to harness the various pockets of localized knowledge that these problems demand are those who are closest to those pockets, not the monolithic entity at the center that’s trying to do all of the planning and commanding top-down. So, rather than marshaling an army that searches the world over blindly, it is much more effective to instead create incentive structures that encourage individuals to self-organize.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"card-quote\" index=\"1\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than marshaling an army that searches the world over blindly for long-tail data, it is much more effective to instead create incentive structures that encourage individuals to self-organize.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Ccite\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fshare?text=Rather than marshaling an army that searches the world over blindly for long-tail data, it is much more effective to instead create incentive structures that encourage individuals to self-organize.&amp;url=https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Flong-tail-problem-in-a-i\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"twitter-share\"\u003E\u003Ci class=\"icon-twitter\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fi\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EShare\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fcite\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is true because there is simply no way that a single mind (or a small group of minds) at the center can match the endless knowledge and creativity of a diverse ecosystem of people who are all aligned with one another by the presence of a well calibrated market. Adam Smith’s “invisible hand of the market” is, after all, but a metaphor for the power of bottom-up self-organization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, the knowledge and resources that are necessary to innovate in AI are held in the pockets of giants — well beyond the reach of most individuals and startups. But, through the creation of efficient and global markets around them, they can be made more accessible. We might discover that market-based systems that are built bottom-up offer society a new approach, one that’s more disruptive to entrenched power structures, for building intelligent computer systems. The difference will be in who ends up controlling them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEach new mini-hivemind may start out modestly. But, the right set of incentives, credibly engraved into a kind of covenant whose governance is decentralized (a smart contract), has the potential to coordinate human energy at a scale that dwarfs even that of our largest giants. And so, in the end, it may turn out that AI is not so inherently communist after all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
