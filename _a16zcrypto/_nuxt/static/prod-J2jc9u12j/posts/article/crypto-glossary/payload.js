Just as we don&#8217;t need to understand what TCP\u002FIP is or how packet routing works to use the world wide web, we don&#8217;t need to know all the details of crypto to use it or benefit from it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first fell in love with crypto, I was still serving as a Green Beret in the U.S. Army Special Forces. I was fascinated by the idea that math and game theory could form the foundation of a new economy, and I hungered to learn more. But despite some engineering and math classes in undergrad, I really didn’t have a deep technical background. I had no idea where to start. I began haphazardly studying computer science, game theory, and cryptography. It was only during my time in graduate school that I had the opportunity to put it all together and learn from some of the leading experts in these fields in a structured way. And even now, I still don&#8217;t feel like a true domain expert.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fact is, in a space that evolves as rapidly as crypto, no one really is an expert. But knowing where to start can help make the subject more approachable to anyone. To that end, below is a glossary of terminology and key concepts in the space &#8212; it covers the basics of cryptography and blockchain, smart contracts and applications, security\u002Fprivacy, and other useful definitions. We hope this glossary serves as both an introduction and as a reference for newcomers \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C\u002Fem\u003E crypto veterans alike. You can also find our previous Crypto Canon of readings and other resources here. Better yet, we hope all of this inspires more people to learn more about this exciting space.

The study of these techniques is called “cryptography” (from Greek “kryptos”, meaning hidden). In the internet era, cryptography is used to protect computer information &#8212; the massive volume of data flowing over networks and routed through millions of computers every second. Without cryptography, information exchange and commerce at the speed of the internet would be impossible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf two people want to communicate securely with each other, cryptography lets them:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eencode and exchange messages with each other, so that no one else who might intercept the messages can read them (“privacy”);\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eensure the messages they receive have not been tampered with in transit (“integrity”);\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eknow that the messages they receive are actually from the other, and not from another interloper (“authenticity”).\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptography is synonymous with secure communication, and the term “crypto” can refer to cryptography in the context of information security. More recently, however, “\u003Cstrong\u003Ecrypto\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E” has become the informal industry term for cryptocurrencies and cryptonetworks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecryptographic hash function\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECryptographic hash functions are special programs that ensure the integrity of data in digital applications. The outputs of a hash function are called “cryptographic digests” and are the foundational data structures upon which blockchains are built.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA hash function takes input data of any length and returns a value that is fixed length. This output value (sometimes called a “digest” or “tag”), is computed in a way that is &#8212;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Edeterministic: the same input always results in the same output;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Enon-invertible: the output reveals no information about the input;\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ecollision-resistant: no two inputs should result in the same output.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese properties allow hash functions to make finding information more efficient, yet also difficult to reverse-engineer. These functions &#8212; often considered the workhorses of modern cryptography and blockchains &#8212; are used to check for data-tampering. Therefore, they are well-suited to decentralized, permissionless applications.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecryptographic digest\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe output of a hash function is called a “cryptographic digest”. A cryptographic digest is a unique, fixed-length tag representing a single piece of data.  It is used to detect tampering, since even a small change to that data input to the hash function results in a totally different output. For example, a cryptographic digest of the Tolstoy novel, \u003Cem\u003EWar and Peace,\u003C\u002Fem\u003E will differ from the cryptographic digest of the same novel with a single misspelled word.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this property, cryptographic digests are well-suited for immutable record keeping. In a blockchain, these digests are linked together to create a ledger of transactions that no one can remove, modify, or otherwise tamper with. Therefore, anyone can reconstruct the blockchain from any point and verify its correctness.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Etamper-proof ledger\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA ledger is a list of transactions. Those transactions don’t necessarily have to be payments; they can represent transfers of any asset, such as real estate deeds or an interest-bearing security.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA blockchain is fundamentally a tamper-proof ledger. Because each ledger transaction is a cryptographic digest, an entry cannot be altered without detection. Furthermore, by hashing and turning the\u003Cem\u003E entire ledger \u003C\u002Fem\u003Einto a cryptographic digest &#8212; as blockchains do &#8212; any addition, alteration, or omission of any transaction will change the cryptographic digest of the entire ledger. Thus, blockchains enable participants to audit one another in a decentralized manner.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Epublic key \u002F private key\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn cryptography, a \u003Cstrong\u003Eprivate key\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E is a secret number or code. A special mathematical function is then applied to this private key in order to derive a second value, a \u003Cstrong\u003Epublic key\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.  This value does not have to be kept secret because the public key reveals nothing about the private key.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy analogy, a public key is the address of your house, but the private key is the physical key that unlocks your front door. Simply knowing the address of a house does not help you to unlock the front door.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does this matter?  In blockchain networks, a public key is the address to which assets can be transferred. Knowledge of the corresponding secret private key is the only way to spend those assets, just like a PIN code is required to withdraw from a checking account. But with public\u002Fprivate keys, you don’t need to trust a bank: You only need to trust the underlying math of a well-proven cryptographic system, the same system that already protects trillions of dollars-worth of payments over the internet today.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edigital signatures\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust like fingerprints, digital signatures are unique to a single person or entity.

For instance, “state” might refer to an individual checking account balance; after spending $20, the state of the account should represent their new, reduced balance. The state of the system is usually maintained by trusted third party, like a bank or a company web server.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains enable decentralized networks to maintain a shared state among nodes.

These networking protocols govern the transmission and handling of information as well as execution of programs between interconnected but independent devices. For example, TCP (transmission control protocol) represents one of the foundational protocols for managing packets of information as they travel across the internet, powering applications like the world wide web, email, media streaming, and more.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn cryptonetworks, the most important protocol is the consensus protocol. This is the protocol followed by each network participant (or node) to create a single, shared state of the blockchain.

Contrast this with a peer-to-peer network, where the connections resemble more of a “spiderweb”. In a peer-to-peer network, each node operates under a single communication protocol to transfer data between them; this model is often less efficient, but much more resilient because there is no single point of failure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the most famous example of a peer-to-peer network is the internet itself. The original internet, known as ARPANET, was invented by the U.S. Department of Defense as a way to ensure defense communication would never go down, even in the event of nuclear war. Disabling individual ARPANET nodes would not stop message traffic; they are simply routed along different paths to the same destination. Similarly, shutting down a single node, or even multiple nodes, on a blockchain network does not stop transactions from being processed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Enode\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA node is a device that participates in a network by following the network protocol.

This is the Byzantine Generals Problem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause blockchain networks assume no trust between participants, their underlying consensus protocols must all somehow address this problem to overcome faulty or malicious adversaries who try to subvert the system.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Econsensus\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe consensus protocol is akin to the operating system of a blockchain.

This means that blockchain designers face tradeoffs about what to prioritize. Consensus algorithms aiming for speed often limit the number of network participants, making it less decentralized. On the other hand, protocols that prioritize decentralization and failure-prevention tend to be slower and less performant.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edecentralization\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDecentralization is the degree to which control &#8212; power, resource allocation, etc. &#8212; over a given network is distributed across a large, representative base of independent actors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn most systems, there is a tradeoff between efficiency and decentralization, because coordination costs increase with the number of participants. However, decentralization also provides redundancy and fault-tolerance that a centralized system cannot match. Take the analogy of a democracy, which could be considered a “decentralized” political system. Even though the American democratic system can be inefficient and messy at times, it has proven remarkably resilient. Similarly, blockchain networks are strictly less efficient than centralized databases, yet offer the unique properties of redundancy and censorship-resistance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edouble-spending problem\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPrevious efforts to create a decentralized digital currency failed because there is no “scarcity” in the digital world.

In contrast, a dollar bill or bar of gold has physical scarcity because the owner does not physically possess either after payment for a good or service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPrior to Bitcoin, the only known way to do digital payments was to use a centralized record-keeper (such as a bank or credit-card company) to keep track of account balances and transactions for every individual. This entity also ensures that no one spends the same balance twice, which replicates the physical scarcity of real currency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn blockchains, there is no central record-keeper, so the solution to the double spend problem must be solved through the rules of the network.

In the physical world, the ultimate scarce resource is time, so a proof-of-work could be a simple timecard of hours spent at the office. In the digital world, it is trivial for a computer to “forge” a simple timecard. So, we need some other proof that some computational resources were expended.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1800s, gold miners in California were paid by weight for the gold they physically extracted from the ground. Because gold is scarce, the amount of gold a miner brought for payment was proportional to the amount of effort they spent to get it. It was also easy to verify that the gold was real; a manager could simply weigh and inspect it in a fraction of the time it took to mine. How could we replicate this in a decentralized, digital world?
