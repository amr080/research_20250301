He’d just spoken to our banker from the local branch down the street, where we’d kept our money for more than a decade. The bank had frozen all of our accounts indefinitely. We had no idea why. Our banker was not allowed to tell us anything else. Not even if or how or when we might get our money back. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EMy husband and I are rule followers, so this should have been impossible. And because we grew up in families on tight budgets, we’ve long kept a lot of our money in cash in a bank to be prepared for whatever surprises might arise. But our bank’s decision to freeze our accounts meant we had no access to any of our money at all. It was more than a little frightening. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAt the time, I was working for a crypto company. Was I part of the sweep many banks appear to have done to close out crypto company employees’ bank accounts? I don’t know. Honestly, I don’t think I was important enough. But did working for a crypto company play a role? Probably. Most likely I was caught in one of the hundreds of algorithms that all banks have to design and run to comply with \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fx.com\u002FMinarikLaw\u002Fstatus\u002F1879728496584376473\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Elaws that require banks\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E to help the government identify potential bad guys.

They miss plenty of bad guys. They catch plenty of good guys. And there are virtually no remedies for the harms done to those good guys who are unlucky enough to get caught up by them. Sometimes your account is closed and you can take your money and leave. Other times, as in my case, your account is frozen and the bank goes silent. Sometimes the law does not allow the bank to tell you anything at all. Not even to try to figure out if their algorithm made a mistake. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis happens all the time to Americans, not just those of us in crypto, and often with much scarier or worse outcomes.

In the first 24 hours of panic over what to do after losing access to my bank accounts, I realized I did have some assets somewhere else, an inadvertent emergency fund stored in a much safer place than cash under my mattress: I had bitcoin in a self-custody crypto wallet. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ESelf-custody wallets are at the heart of DeFi. It’s not a bank account, or really an account at all. It’s a non-custodial technology service — software that lets you safely and securely store and spend your own money. It’s the digital version of the wallet in your back pocket. You are the one holding and controlling your own money at all times, not a bank or anyone else.  \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EMy self-custody wallet meant that I still had a safe way to access my own assets if I needed them. Access that could not be shut off by a bank’s misapplication of an algorithm. Access that could not be shut off by a government determination that a legal industry was not worthy of traditional banking services. It was a lifeline. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis is not a partisan issue. All Americans need access to safe financial services in order to live our lives. We shouldn’t be at risk of those services being turned off when the government or banks themselves deem whole parts of society unworthy — not unlawful, but unworthy. And now we have the technology to give every American this access, as long as we enable this technology to be built safely and responsibly here. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAmerica’s answer has never before been to shut down promising new tech entirely. We shouldn’t start now. We don’t shut down search engines because you can find bad information through them. We don’t shut down email services because bad guys commit fraud through them. The answer is to tailor regulations to actual risk, rather than force new technology into boxes so ill-fitting they destroy the potential benefits altogether. The answer is to go after the actual bad guys, not the good faith American builders eager to play by the rules. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOtherwise we are punishing every single one of us who deserves access to a safe way to store and use their assets that can’t be arbitrarily taken from them, as well as the builders who choose to create jobs and new industries here, rather than overseas.  \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAs for the end of my story, it took almost two months to get (most of) our money back from my old bank. After countless phone calls and complaints and emails and pleas. The bank wouldn’t let us pick up a check, and they wouldn’t even send the money by certified mail. They sent it by regular mail — where all kinds of financial theft happens, but of course no one wants to shut down the entire postal system because of that. So I sat on our front porch stalking our mailperson’s route until the check arrived, now safely deposited elsewhere.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EI am deeply sympathetic to the fear that new technology can create new risks. I welcome any conversation with anyone who thinks we can’t protect Americans while also building responsible DeFi that makes American lives better. And I’m sharing this very personal story publicly to shine a light on this problem in our traditional financial system that is long overdue for fixing, but also as a reminder of the individual people who can be harmed if we act out of fear and prejudice alone against the unknown.

At their peak, dominant nations dictate the rules of trade, finance, and military power, providing their currency with global credibility and trust.

Overextension — whether through war, costly expansions, or unsustainable social commitments — eventually erodes credibility. The Spanish Real de a Ocho, once backed by vast silver reserves from Latin America, declined as Spain’s mounting debts and economic mismanagement eroded its dominance. The Dutch guilder faded as relentless wars drained the Netherlands’ resources. The French franc, dominant in the 18th and early 19th centuries, weakened under the strain of revolution, Napoleonic wars, and financial mismanagement. And the British pound, once the bedrock of global finance, unraveled under the weight of post-war debts and the rise of American industrial dominance.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe lesson is simple: Economic and military power may create a reserve currency, but financial stability and institutional leadership are what sustain it.

Gold and silver weren’t just valuable because they were scarce, they were also divisible, durable, and portable, making them effective currencies — even without sovereign backing or issuance, much like Bitcoin today. Similarly, China’s early paper money didn’t begin as a government-imposed medium of exchange.

But this oversimplifies reality. What gives fiat money its strength isn’t just legal decree, it’s the government’s ability to enforce taxation and its capacity to meet debt obligations through this power. A currency backed by a state with a strong tax base has intrinsic demand because businesses and individuals need it to settle obligations. This taxation power is what enables fiat currencies to retain value, even without a direct commodity backing.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut even fiat systems weren’t built from scratch.

To conduct surveillance on customers and prepare these reports that go into the FinCEN Database, financial institutions and other covered businesses spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on compliance personnel and technology — all to appease regulators who often engage in check-the-box exercises rather than assessing the overall effectiveness of a compliance program. The costs of these programs are passed on to customers in the form of higher banking fees, overly burdensome account opening requirements, and even denial of financial services. This is especially true for low-income customers, who are more likely to transact in cash and have more difficulty proving consistent sources of income. These high compliance costs also pose formidable barriers to entry for smaller financial service providers — including fintech startups — who need to build a business before establishing million-dollar compliance programs.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThere is a better way: Blockchain technologies offer a solution to these problems.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBlockchain transactions are made on shared, public ledgers, which anyone, including law enforcement, can view. While the identity of the transactors is not publicly available on blockchains — as their inherent design protects the identity of users — financial institutions know who their customers are, so they can track which blockchain transactions affect their customers. It also means that the government, with the help of blockchain analytics firms and their own developing methods, can see criminal activity happening in real time without having to know the names of the individuals engaged in the transactions. When the criminal activity touches a financial institution, the government can then submit a subpoena for specific customer records, without having to bulk-collect that data and store it. This approach is more targeted, rather than all-seeing and all-encompassing. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBlockchain-based systems in turn create more security for customers — whose information is not preemptively sent to the government — and they also make for faster, more effective law enforcement investigations.

It’s not a flashy process, but it’s designed to ensure fairness and thoroughness. By administrative design, rulemaking is a relatively measured and deliberative process. (There’s even a section in most rule releases un-ironically entitled “The Paperwork Reduction Act.”) So it’s curious that a number of recent rules proposed under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler have sought extension to crypto assets and crypto markets, seemingly without any discussion or deliberation on how they would apply. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe SEC has frequently been criticized for its crypto-related “regulation by enforcement” over the years, but what’s less appreciated is how its “rulemaking by extension” — taking rules developed for other markets or products and applying them wholesale to new areas of technology — has been equally counterproductive. Rules for traditional securities markets often don’t align with crypto; the uniqueness of blockchain technologies warrants its own considerations. Now, there’s an opportunity for the Commission to adopt a bespoke approach to rulemaking that will help the technology thrive while protecting investors and consumers. (Except where Congress has expressed an intent to legislate — including on some matters relating to decentralized finance, or, DeFi — the agency should postpone relevant rulemaking.) \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe new administration at the SEC can address existing shortcomings by reexamining proposed rules. These include the Best Execution Rule for broker-dealers, the Safeguarding Rule for registered investment advisers, and the proposal to amend the definition of an “exchange.” These rules are primarily concerned with the regulation of traditional securities markets and market intermediaries. Yet, as proposed, all of these rules note that they would also apply to “crypto asset securities” and entities that transact in “crypto asset securities.” \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis approach fails in three aspects. First, it is based on the premise that &#8220;crypto asset securities” is a clear and well understood term. Although a tokenized version of a traditional security, such as a stock or bond, would fall within the SEC’s regulatory jurisdiction, it is much less clear when other forms of crypto assets represent securities within the SEC sphere. Proposing rules without providing clarity as to their reach or limit is a terrible practice. The proposed rules also are lacking in that they have not taken into account how crypto assets that are securities, such as tokenized equities or bonds, differ from non-crypto based securities. These differences need to be reflected in any new rulemaking if they are to be effective. In other words, on the surface these rules, designed to provide investor protections in familiar contexts, like broker-dealer order routing or asset custody — need to be carefully tailored to work with respect to this new asset class with unique features. The best way to approach this tailoring reveals the third problem in the rules as proposed — they have not been based on market data and industry input, both of which are essential to ensuring the rules work operationally.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EOtherwise?

At its core, the proposal aims to ensure registered investment advisers (RIAs) properly safeguard client assets, including crypto. Sounds fair, right? But the way it’s written makes one thing clear: It’s about making custody in the crypto space commercially impracticable. Instead of being principals-based and allowing knowledgeable fiduciaries to design appropriate procedures (as is the case under much of the Investment Advisers Act), the proposed rule all but ensures that \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapi.a16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2023\u002F05\u002Fa16z-Safeguarding-Rule-Comment-Letter.pdf\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ERIAs won’t even bother trying\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E.  (For example, under the proposal an RIA could not legally purchase a crypto asset if custodians do not offer safeguarding services for that particular asset. Should there exist a qualified custodian that can hold the asset for the RIA, then the RIA [really, its clients] must forgo making productive use of the asset [voting or staking] while it sits idle in the portfolio.) It does the same for banks too, preventing them from doing what they do best: determining how best to safeguard assets.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe SEC would be better served by taking a different approach. Rather than suffocating custody solutions for crypto, why not offer clear guidance on how to establish safeguarding controls tailored for this unique asset class? Crypto isn’t traditional — it comes with challenges like the management of private keys, decentralized platforms, and constantly evolving technologies. But these challenges are surmountable, and regulators could work with industry leaders to craft a framework that protects investors without squelching an asset class.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ELet’s consider another example. The SEC’s proposed Best Execution Rule primarily seeks to establish a best execution standard for broker-dealers. The proposed rule focuses on the regulation of order routing practices in traditional securities markets and on payment-for-order-flow arrangements, but it also observes that it “would apply to all securities, including any digital asset that is a security or a government security under the Federal securities laws.” Despite this, the SEC provides no evidence to suggest that payment-for-order-flow is as prevalent in crypto markets as it is in traditional securities markets. Nor does the SEC even consider that direct retail participation in the crypto markets is far more significant than in traditional securities markets — meaning that brokers play a very different role in crypto markets. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EMost puzzling of all is that the SEC does not even consider what “best execution” might mean in the context of crypto markets, making compliance with the proposed rule nearly impossible. Should a broker-dealer seek execution on the best regulated crypto asset market? Or should it seek execution on the deepest crypto asset markets, irrespective of that market’s regulatory status? Should a broker-dealer consider only the universe of U.S. domiciled crypto asset markets when seeking to identify the best market? Or should it consider all crypto asset markets, irrespective of location? The proposal provides no answer, just the blanket application of rules that were designed for an entirely different system and do not have an obvious application to transactions in crypto assets.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFinally, let’s consider the SEC’s proposal to redefine the term “exchange” under Securities Exchange Act Rule 3b-16. The proposal has been so controversial that it was opened for comment three times over two years. For context, ordinary proposals will be opened only once by the SEC prior to rule adoption. The initial proposal ignored crypto asset markets altogether. Then over a year later, the SEC re-proposed the rule with a supplement noting that the proposed revisions would apply to all crypto exchanges, centralized and decentralized. Amazingly, the SEC noted in that proposal that it lacked data on both crypto asset securities as well as crypto asset trading platforms, yet it went ahead with some crypto-focused revisions anyway. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ERather than forcing ill-fitting rules onto crypto, the SEC should reconsider its misguided approach. It should start with the assumption that rules for traditional securities markets don’t apply to crypto, unless explicitly stated otherwise. It should gather data and collaborate with industry experts to understand the unique features of the assets and the technologies so that it can craft a regulatory framework specifically suited to them. And while not giving the crypto industry a free pass, it should recognize that it already has powerful tools, like Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, to address fraud and manipulation. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EA bespoke approach to rulemaking is superior. After the financial crisis, the SEC adopted a tailored approach to regulating security-based swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, SEC rules exempted swaps and swap market participants from some registration requirements as the regulator learned how these markets work and adapted its approach to more appropriately handle the unique risks of these instruments. This allowed the SEC to tailor specific rules to the contours of swap trading while still retaining the power to address fraud and manipulation.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhile the SEC’s campaign of “regulation by enforcement” has attracted the most attention in recent years, its “rulemaking by extension” has also been damaging. Hopefully, the new leadership at the SEC will adopt an approach where new instruments, technologies, and new business models are regulated with clarity and on terms that accommodate innovation. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EScott Walker\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E is Chief Compliance Officer at Andreessen Horowitz.

Stablecoins are digital assets whose designer pegs their price to another reference asset, typically a currency like the U.S. dollar.

(How the underlying assets can be redeemed by repaying \u002F burning the associated stablecoin depends on every protocol’s specific architecture and governance.) The optimal nature of these backing mechanisms, however, remains an open question.

Tokenization may sound like some kind of mysterious alchemy, but the concept is simple: It means “creating a digital representation of” some physical thing — a stock, bond, commodity, or other asset — in a database, usually a blockchain or distributed ledger. The token serves as a financial record.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EHowever, most of these projects either have launched outside the U.S., or have been forced to limit their operations to cut off the world of digital finance from the rest of the financial ecosystem. U.S. regulators have to date mostly failed to appreciate the many benefits of tokenization, and so have enforced artificial and arbitrary distinctions that effectively disallow it in traditional finance. In the past few years the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has drawn hard and fast lines between tokens and other assets. It has done this even though its own pre-existing regulatory frameworks around financial recordkeeping would otherwise allow it. The time is now to remove these flawed and untenable restrictions in place of appropriate measures.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EFinancial records have taken various forms over the years, from written ledgers to tapes to electronic systems. As recently as a few years ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required brokers to maintain their electronic records “exclusively in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format” — a permanent record, in other words. Firms were forced to maintain a mirror set of records on obsolete media such as tapes and optical disks for official purposes even as they kept books and records for actual use in modern formats, like cloud storage. It was wasteful and backwards.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ETo the SEC’s credit, it amended the record keeping rules in January 2023. The change permitted firms to use electronic records as long as the systems provided for a complete audit trail, enabling original records to be recreated even if modified or deleted. There was no specific requirement for the type of database in which these records must be stored, as long as the audit trail requirements were met. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ETheoretically, this should have opened the door to using the latest and most sophisticated technologies available — including blockchains and distributed ledgers. The benefits of such systems — advancing liquidity, reducing counterparty risk and trade failures, and creating efficiencies across markets — make them a compelling choice. Through blockchains, outdated systems could be replaced with technologies that streamline the process of execution and clearing of trades. Arcane and completely unnecessary registered entities such as transfer agents could be cut out entirely. Data reconciliation could occur automatically by connecting the systems of various financial intermediaries. And reporting could be automated by including self-regulatory organizations as observers. Indeed, what better audit trail than an indelible blockchain that shows a record of all transactions? \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EBut U.S. regulators haven’t seen it this way. Through informal guidance and statements (rather than formal rulemaking and legislation), they have severely curtailed the adoption of blockchains and distributed ledger technologies across the financial industry. For example, a joint statement issued by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in 2019 effectively prohibited registered broker-dealers from holding tokenized securities on behalf of customers. Their statement said that it may be impossible for broker-dealers to establish that they have “control” over tokenized securities, making it infeasible to comply with customer protection rules. They cited the risks of fraud and theft as well as information security risks. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThis prohibition misses the mark. Financial institutions already all use digital records to evidence possession or control. Paper stock certificates have been obsolete since the paperwork crisis of the 1960s and, since then, various institutions in the chain of custody have represented interests in securities through ledger entries. The concerns about tokenized securities cited by the regulators — potential loss of private keys or misdirected transfers — are technical considerations similar to those associated with the transformation of markets to digital records, and these technical considerations already have many solutions in the marketplace. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe 2019 guidance seems to posit that tokenized securities are different in character from securities whose records are maintained in non-distributed ledgers. No one would think to view these non-distributed records as separate assets from the rights in the shares themselves, or that these records are somehow regulated differently from the shares. Ownership rights in securities can be recorded in written or electronic form, but the ink or computer code does not replace the rights; if a copy of a ledger is made, the owner of an asset listed on the ledger does not suddenly have an entitlement to twice the number of securities that it did before. Just so, it does not appear necessary to regulate the tokenized representation of a security as anything different from the security itself. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIf not for U.S. regulators’ somewhat recent artificial and arbitrary restrictions, existing regulatory frameworks would already allow financial industry participants to use blockchains to record transactions in traditional assets — securities in particular — without thinking of digital tokens as separate from the assets they represent. While the SEC has allowed a narrow subset of broker-dealers to maintain blockchain-based records through guidance issued in 2021, this guidance is extremely narrow, limited to broker-dealers who deal only in digital asset securities. Most large broker-dealers deal in many types of securities and have legacy recordkeeping systems that would need to be transitioned to blockchain-based systems over time. The SEC’s current guidance precludes that from happening. It’s unsurprising therefore that pilot projects relating to blockchain-based securities records have taken place in the UK, the EU and Singapore…but not the United States.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWhile the full realization of the initial dream of blockchains in finance may be years off, there is no reason for the industry to subject itself to additional regulatory impairments when the legal infrastructure already exists to support the recording of asset transactions onchain. Assets are just assets, regardless of their material qualities. How their records are kept should mostly be a matter of housekeeping, with the most advantageous technology prevailing.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EJenny Cieplak\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E is a partner at Latham &amp; Watkins LLP who advises fintech and financial services clients on the development and deployment of new technologies.

Money-transmitting businesses are subject to certain registration and information-reporting provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 5312, and a criminal code provision punishing people for failing to register their business, 18 U.S.C. § 1960. The penalties are extraordinarily harsh: Section 1960 subjects violators up to $250,000 in fines and up to five years in prison.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EClarifying and codifying a correct interpretation of money transmission law necessarily involves incorporating concepts of custody and control into the law itself. This also means ensuring government entities consistently interpret the law in a way that incorporates those concepts. We believe this issue is the most critical one facing the industry in the United States because, left unaddressed, the DOJ can continue to accuse developers of non-custodial software — be it a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, the bitcoin protocol, or a similar neutral protocol — of running “unlicensed money transmitting businesses,” even where the allegation makes no sense because those developers have no control over the software or user assets. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe definitions of the terms relating to “money transmission” should leave no doubt about their correct interpretation.

Take a person swapping digital assets: The person can use the services of a centralized exchange business or DeFi protocols to do so. To use a centralized exchange, the person first transfers their digital assets to the exchange, after which the exchange has custody of and exercises control over those assets. The exchange, in turn, effectuates transactions on behalf of the person at that person’s direction. In other words, the exchange “accepts” and “transmits” a user’s funds on the user’s behalf. The centralized exchange’s control over the person’s funds presents certain risks (e.g., loss and misuse) —and policy responses targeting what it can and cannot do with that control can mitigate those risks. In the event the centralized exchange loses the assets they’re controlling on behalf of the person, the exchange should be on the hook.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIn DeFi, the person can accomplish a similar result but without having to cede control over their assets to a third party. When using a decentralized software protocol to exchange digital assets, a person retains control over their digital assets and never cedes that control. Instead, the person uses a novel kind of software tool — a DeFi exchange protocol — to unilaterally conduct the exchange on their own, at their own direction. And unlike the centralized exchange business, the original developer of a DeFi protocol does not retain control over the protocol or have the ability to control how third-parties use it. Only the users of a DeFi protocol exercise control over their own assets. And while there are risks associated with using a DeFi protocol (e.g., it can be complicated technology with higher instances of user error), there is less risk that a third party will lose user funds because the user never gives up custody in the first place. (The bank going down isn’t a risk to you if you’re holding on to your own assets yourself.)\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EA basic understanding of control — in this case, the ability of a third party to actually move funds belonging to the user — is key here. It’s why a centralized exchange business, like the one described above, is appropriately regulated as a “money transmitting” business while the developers of an immutable, non-custodial smart contract protocol are not. It also highlights the perils of improperly understanding and misattributing control. To identify and mitigate sources of risk, on the one hand, and to properly assign liability when things go wrong, on the other hand, requires either identifying who has the necessary control over a system to mitigate risks or who is most responsible for some action in need of redress.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EIndustry and lawmakers must come together in 2025 to ensure the law properly reflects accurate concepts of custody and control and the responsibilities that flow from it — whether that’s in the context of a market structure bill, broker reporting obligations, or in reforming Section 1960. At the moment, the industry faces a real threat from the DOJ’s overbroad and erroneous interpretation of what constitutes an unlicensed money transmitting business, one of many misunderstandings that exist all across the crypto policy landscape. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EAs we saw in the analogy above, the automobile likely would not have succeeded if carmakers were held liable for every collision outside of their control.

Despite the clear benefits and growth of these networks, the SEC has asserted that some staking as a service business models constitute an investment activity or contract under U.S. securities laws. In-line with former Chairman Gary Gensler’s unfortunate and misguided “regulation by enforcement” approach, a number of SEC enforcement actions have in many instances chilled or halted staking models, thereby harming individuals across the country who seek to support decentralized blockchain protocols.

Proof-of-stake blockchains allow all token holders to participate in maintaining and securing the network.

and comprehensive regulatory framework for decentralized open-source systems remains a challenge, as it requires the effective tailoring of various legislative and policy initiatives within existing laws across the entire U.S. regulatory framework.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the complexity of the tax code and innovative organizational structures essential to decentralized systems, it is no surprise that policymakers have struggled to effectively establish clear rules regarding the reporting requirements and tax treatment of digital assets.  However, this legislative session provides a historic opportunity to reclaim leadership in a technology that’s reshaping global finance, as well as the future of the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 2025 expiration of numerous provisions of the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.irs.gov\u002Fnewsroom\u002Ftax-cuts-and-jobs-act-a-comparison-for-businesses\"\u003ETax Cuts and Jobs Act\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (TCJA) have set the stage for income tax to be addressed in the first session of the 119\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\u002Fsup\u003E Congress.  It is expected that tax legislation will be passed through an expedited process known as reconciliation.  While limited to budgetary items like taxes, spending and the debt limit, reconciliation provides Congress the ability to enact legislation with a simple majority vote.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the most comprehensive tax legislation since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), the extension of the TCJA will be a significant undertaking, which will require multiple Congressional committees to each contribute legislation to address their respective reconciliation instructions, further complicated by President Trump’s wide expansion of tariffs and the expected formation of an External Revenue Service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Republican majority in both the House and Senate has committed to enacting President Trump’s legislative agenda \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.reuters.com\u002Fworld\u002Fus\u002Fus-house-republicans-divided-over-how-pay-trumps-tax-cuts-2025-01-26\u002F?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"\u003Ewhile prioritizing substantial reductions in spending\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.  Although budgetary scoring is likely to be offset by the expected revenue derived from tariffs and spending cuts, for American citizens to realize tangible benefits, enacted policy changes must result in increased domestic production and economic growth within the United States.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPresident Trump’s commitment to the rapidly growing crypto industry, along with targeted legislation, can realize these tangible benefits by addressing lingering uncertainties and incentivizing American industry to remain in America.  In particular, the U.S. should act to protect decentralized finance (DeFi), provide clarity for domestic projects, and provide a pathway for foreign projects to return to the United States.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EProtect decentralized finance (DeFi)\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs disappointing as it was predictable, the final Treasury Regulations providing guidance on tax reporting requirements applicable to certain DeFi platforms released on December 27, 2024, far exceeded the provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobst Act (IIJA).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is entirely appropriate and expected for the Treasury Secretary to be involved in the crafting of legislation relevant to the application of the Internal Revenue Code, after advocating for amended language, having that language be specifically excluded from the legislation and then proceeding as if no amended language was necessary (in this case an exceedingly broad definition of “broker” beyond any existing or proposed meaning), it is utterly indefensible for the Treasury Department and the IRS to proceed with finalized Treasury Regulations flaunting the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.coindesk.com\u002Fpolicy\u002F2021\u002F12\u002F14\u002Fus-lawmakers-ask-janet-yellen-to-define-broker-for-infrastructure-bill\"\u003Eintent of

to be enacted, but even so, final Treasury Regulations cannot merely be set aside, and a significant amount of time, money and effort will be spent rectifying this unnecessary impediment.  To that end, immediate replacement legislation is being considered, lawsuits have been filed and Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mike Carey have introduced a \u003Ca

being entered into the Federal Registry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELimited to just the final regulations pertaining to DeFi, the CRA does not include the final Treasury Regulations providing reporting procedures for more conventional “custodial brokers,” released on June 28, 2024.  Far from perfect, the “custodial broker” regulations did at least reflect genuine consideration of the comments received and are serviceable final regulations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CRA prevents reissuance of “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fcrsreports.congress.gov\u002Fproduct\u002Fpdf\u002FIF\u002FIF10023\"\u003Esubstantially the same form\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” which is typically ameliorated by the affected agency focusing on changing the aspects giving rise to the specific objections.  Currently, the specific objections have not been fully articulated.  However, as the entire final regulations are premised on an interpretation beyond authority granted by Congress, it is unlikely that the specific objections can be addressed through resubmission.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile further study has been recommended on this subject and there are many details to be considered around the upgradeability of smart contracts, enacted legislation should unambiguously state that interaction with smart contract protocols, whether through a front-end or not, should not be considered sufficient intermediation giving rise to tax reporting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ERemove uncertainty for domestic projects\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA number of modest legislative considerations can help to remove lingering uncertainties for domestic projects, thereby fostering U.S. innovation. These could be introduced into the expected taxation legislation and provide significant benefits without requiring stand-alone legislation or significant effort to explain their purpose.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the IRS has provided \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.irs.gov\u002Fbusinesses\u002Fsmall-businesses-self-employed\u002Fdigital-assets\"\u003Esignificant sub-regulatory guidance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E that is fairly consistent with first principles analysis and existing law, a general lack of cohesion and consistency in how defined terms are utilized creates significant ambiguity in the application of that guidance.  Simply including more thorough and consistent definitions of activity pertaining to terms like “digital assets,” “airdrops,” and “smart contract protocols” would provide unambiguous guidance in how to apply existing tax law, which can easily be accomplished in the expected 2025 legislation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, given the scope of the provisions under review, legislative developments should be monitored for appropriate additions of items like the electability of mark-to-market method for dealers and traders of digital assets, exclusion of income earned from proof-of-stake delegation to third party validators from unrelated business taxable income and clarification that wrapping tokens to enhance functionality is not a realization event if the custodian has no right to transfer the underlying cryptocurrency and the value of the wrapped token is pegged to that of the original token.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, as Congress considers the particular merits of each provision of the TCJA, a number of broader tax considerations could have a direct impact on the taxation of digital assets and the crypto industry, and any such provision should be monitored to ensure that the provision is inclusive of digital assets and the crypto industry.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, provisions like the Domestic Production Activities Deduction (DPAD) and the deductibility of casualty and theft loss were removed from the original TCJA – however, both have been mentioned as possibly being included in the tax legislation around extending the expiring provisions of the TCJA.  DPAD is the likely vehicle for President Trump to enact a favorable rate of taxation for domestic production, and it is particularly likely to be at least considered within the upcoming tax legislation.  As the purpose of DPAD is to promote domestic production that includes software development, if measures to include DPAD were to be undertaken, any limitations on software development to exclude the crypto industry should be addressed as the legislation evolves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EProvide a pathway for offshore projects to return to the U.S.\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe opportunity to finally resolve the confusion surrounding the classification of digital assets under securities laws with market structure legislation will allow the industry to finally move past the specter of former chairman Gary Gensler’s SEC and provide a clear path for new blockchain projects to form in the United States.  Unfortunately, legislative solutions are likely necessary to address the tax ramifications for projects wishing to form in the United States that already utilized offshore foundations (a practice involving significant risk and in their typical utilization, necessitated delegation of authority away from decentralized governance mechanisms in favor of centralized boards, counter to crypto’s ethos of decentralization).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile unlikely to be persuasive as a singular issue within President Trump’s commitment to foster domestic production and incentivize operational activity within the United States, the original TCJA provided provisions for repatriation of offshore assets for multinational corporations that could potentially be widened should the domestication of foreign businesses become a legislative priority.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EConclusion\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe success of crypto is not dependent on special treatment under the law.  The technological and societal benefits of blockchain technology is neither dependent on the outcome of political elections nor on the actions of government to succeed.  However, for that success to continue to be an \u003Cem\u003EAmerican\u003C\u002Fem\u003E success, Congress must enact rules that apply fairly to crypto and apply uniformly across all industries.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 2025 legislative window offers a last chance to align rules with technological reality.  Congress must choose: Will America write the playbook for the

Decentralization is actually at the heart of many issues dominating our conversations &#8212; whether it’s about who controls social media networks that influence our public discourse; who financial institutions choose to bank; who controls the AI tools that help us, but that can also generate bots and deepfakes; and other concerns.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does “decentralization” come in? Because a handful of big corporations and platforms &#8212; all centralized &#8212; have monopoly-like power over the digital products and services we use.

The same can be said of governments. This is why centralization and consolidation are the norm today: See Big Government, Big Banks, Big Tech, and so on.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch like gravity, centralization is a force that’s hard to resist. By comparison, decentralization &#8212; transferring control and power to distributed groups &#8212; is inefficient.

It’s been hard to pull off in practice, however, because the technologies to coordinate at scale haven’t been possible (or available to all).

Decentralization means asking entrepreneurs and developers to give up control of their projects and proceed by consensus, rather than by singular command-and-control. Decentralization means builders, creators, and investors  distribute ownership to other network participants, thereby diluting their own economic interest. Decentralization means actively inviting third-parties to build out a given network, thereby reducing the founders’ own importance, standing, and singular vision. All of these forces push against decentralization.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the easiest and cheapest path to building with blockchain technology is to take shortcuts &#8212; or skip decentralization altogether.

The test requires that for a national securities exchange, such as NYSE or NASDAQ to trade a commodity-based ETP, the listing exchange must have a surveillance agreement with a “regulated market of significant size” in either the commodity or a derivative thereof. Given that the SEC does not consider crypto trading platforms to be “regulated markets,” this functionally means that ETPs can only exist for those crypto assets that have futures markets (regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) which have demonstratively high predictive price discovery of the underlying commodity. This approach overlooks the significant size and transparency of current crypto markets. More importantly, it creates an arbitrary distinction in the standards applicable to crypto-based ETP listing applications and all other commodity-based listing applications.
