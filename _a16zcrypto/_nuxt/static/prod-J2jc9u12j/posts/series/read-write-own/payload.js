Taylor Swift single-handedly got Apple to change their payout policy to creatives when the company didn’t pay artists during their free trial period. After she threatened to pull her entire catalog from Apple, Apple announced the change in policy the very next day. Swift thanked them, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.vanityfair.com\u002Fculture\u002F2015\u002F06\u002Ftaylor-swift-wrote-an-open-letter-to-apple-music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Esaying\u003C\u002Fa\u003E “they listened to us” — and did so in 17 hours — but most other creators and smaller artists don’t have that kind of influence or power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s a structural problem in the entertainment industry, and also involves the way many tech platforms operate today: Creators need power, power comes from control, and control comes from ownership. Even though a platform is nothing without its users contributing content to it, those users receive very little to no profits from those efforts. They have no way to decide what happens on those platforms, either.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question is how to return control where it belongs: back in the hands of creators, and fans.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe original promise of the internet was to connect people directly and remove the gatekeepers. Tech companies then helped connect 5 billion people worldwide, but those same companies have since switched from attracting users, to \u003Cem\u003Eextracting\u003C\u002Fem\u003E from them. First they lured — then locked — us in with convenient tools and irresistible network effects: The more people who use a network, the more valuable it becomes to everyone who uses it. Now these corporate-owned platforms have all the power. Contrary to its initial promise, the internet has become as stagnant and intermediated as the previous era of television, which was dominated by just three networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDon’t like it? Sure, you could quit Apple, Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Spotify, TikTok, and X\u002F Twitter. But you can’t take your follower list, data, or graph of social connections and interactions with you. Sometimes you can’t even take your own content with you. The most popular social networks thus hold audiences captive and, as a result, can charge astronomical “take rates”. Take rates are the percent of revenue that platforms claim for themselves, rather than passing more of that revenue onto their network participants. For Instagram and X, those rates are nearly 100%. (And the terms are often opaque.)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat’s worse, though, is that the CEOs of these platforms have nearly unchecked power to change the rules on their users at whim. They not only can charge higher take-rates any time they like, they can also kick off artists and developers without recourse, and change the algorithms that focus our attention (and therefore artists’ views and listens) overnight. We have all observed the challenges of being a creator today: from the Hollywood writers’ strike, which involved fights over rights to streaming residuals; to the question of who really owns a creator’s work (as artists like Taylor Swift know all too well); to the paltry sums musicians take home despite thousands of streams.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat will it take for creators to get their due? Some legislators have proposed regulating platforms as a remedy, but in practice, such regulation just raises the cost of compliance for the smaller companies, which further entrenches the big incumbents. Last year, Taylor Swift (again) was able to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.washingtonpost.com\u002Fbusiness\u002F2023\u002F06\u002F11\u002Ftaylor-swift-ticketmaster-ticket-meltdown-bills\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Epush policymakers\u003C\u002Fa\u003E across the United States — from Minnesota to New York to Texas to Washington — to take on the Ticketmaster monopoly. Several policymakers also introduced laws at the federal level to ensure price transparency and more. But these are bandaids, trying to stem the flood of injuries platforms inflict on artists and fans and not addressing the structural problem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOthers, meanwhile, are holding out for the platforms themselves to change their ways. Jack Stratton, leader of the indie funk outfit Vulfpeck, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=RJBwI3tAmio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eurged\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Apple to “take back the belt” from Spotify. Stratton argued that Apple could offer opportunities for more direct patronage from fans instead of the reigning pro-rata model, where revenue is distributed based on an artist’s streams. Stratton also pushed for Apple to replace the standard 70\u002F30 revenue split between music rights holders and platforms with a more favorable 90\u002F10 revenue split. It’s a nice idea, but good luck getting there in practice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s also yet another bandaid, because it still leaves creators dependent on the whims of platform owners. What artists really need is a say in their own fates on the platforms they contribute to (and help make profitable). Specifically, creators need more of the revenue share; more direct relationships with their fans; and the ability to freely exit platforms with all their connections, content, and data intact. Most of all, creators need the power to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fread-write-own-intro\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ehelp decide\u003C\u002Fa\u003E the platform rules, so the ground doesn’t suddenly shift under them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile existing platforms could certainly do better by their users, none of this addresses the core structural issue: ownership. That’s where an important new set of technologies — involving crypto and blockchains — can help. Forget the price of Bitcoin. Forget the dog \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fmemecoins-tokens-regulation-policy\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ememes\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. More than cryptocurrencies, blockchains are \u003Cem\u003Econstruction material for building a different kind of internet \u003C\u002Fem\u003E— one that shifts power from corporations to communities, including communities of fans and creators.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains are community-owned and operated, tamper-resistant, and permissionless networks — meaning you don’t have to seek the approval of a single gatekeeper or central intermediary to run them, let alone participate in them. Users (whether creators or fans) don’t have to trust any one leader of a Big Tech platform to keep their promises; the technology encodes those promises. Through blockchain technologies, artists \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fhow-nft-royalties-work\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ecould\u003C\u002Fa\u003E get more with ongoing royalty payments. They can determine how they want their music remixed or repurposed, and even offer their fans more participation and ownership in their work too. Creators and artists can take back control of their online livelihoods.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith blockchains, creators can own what matters most — their network — and with that, their destiny. When users own their relationships, they can exit platforms and bring their business elsewhere — a credible threat that keeps platforms in check. This freedom helps reduce the take-rates platforms can charge creators and users: For instance, popular blockchain-enabled creator platforms today have very low take-rates, some  as low as 1%- 2.5%. Platforms like YouTube have \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thinkific.com\u002Fblog\u002Fyoutube-money-per-view\u002F#:~:text=For%20every%20ad%20that%20runs,that%20in%20the%20next%20section!\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etake-rates\u003C\u002Fa\u003E reaching nearly 50%.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, our digital and creative world is more vast, rich, and convenient than ever. But it comes with a critical tradeoff: Creators are dependent on just a few tech companies that have all the power. These companies depend entirely on the people who use their apps and platforms — yet don’t share much control, ownership, or rewards. Big creators may be fine, but small and medium-sized creators don’t thrive. It’s time to change that. A future defined by blockchains would put power back into the hands of creators and users. Blockchains mean ownership, and ownership means independence.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESee also \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fvoices-onchain-vo\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EVoices Onchain\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which highlights creators who have turned to blockchain technology to unlock new creative possibilities, build deeper connections with fans, and discover more ways to monetize their work.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EChris Dixon is the author of the bestselling \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Freadwriteown\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ERead Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet\u003C\u002Fa\u003E (Random House, 2024) and the founding\u002Fmanaging general partner at a16z crypto.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

distinct cultures are interested in blockchains. The first sees blockchains as a way to build new networks. I call this culture the computer because, at its core, it’s about blockchains powering a new computing movement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other culture is mainly interested in speculation and money-making. Those of this mindset see blockchains solely as a way to create new tokens for trading. I call this culture the casino because, at its core, it’s really just about gambling.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMedia coverage exacerbates confusion over the two cultures. Tales of fortunes won and lost are dramatic, easy to explain, and attention-grabbing. In contrast, the technology story is nuanced, slow to develop, and requires historical context to understand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECasino culture is problematic — and, in the extreme case of the defunct offshore exchange FTX, it’s outright destructive. It takes tokens out of context, wraps them in marketing language, and encourages speculation in them. Whereas responsible token exchanges provide useful services, such as custody, staking, and market liquidity, reckless ones encourage bad behavior and play fast and loose with people’s money. At worst, they’re outright Ponzi schemes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that the fundamental goals of regulators and of blockchain builders are ultimately aligned. Securities laws try to eliminate pockets of asymmetric information with respect to publicly traded securities, thereby minimizing the trust that market participants need to place in management teams. Blockchain builders also try to eliminate centralized pockets of economic and governance power, thereby reducing the amount of trust users must place in other network actors.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of this writing, the last time the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the main regulator of the U.S. securities markets, gave substantive guidance on the topic was in 2019. The agency has since brought several enforcement actions alleging that certain transactions of tokens were subject to securities laws, and it has done so without providing further clarification about the criteria by which it makes these determinations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EApplying pre-internet legal precedents to modern networks leaves gray areas that provide significant advantages to bad actors and non-U.S. companies that don’t follow U.S. rules. The situation today is so complex that regulators themselves can’t agree where to draw the line. For example, the SEC has suggested that Ethereum’s token is a security, but the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the primary U.S. regulator of commodities, has said that it is a commodity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EOwnership and Markets Are Inextricable\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome policymakers have proposed rules that would effectively ban tokens and therefore, for all practical purposes, blockchains. If tokens were purely for speculation, these proposals might be justified. But speculation is just a side effect of tokens’ true purpose as essential tools that enable community-owned networks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause tokens can, like all ownable things, be traded, it is easy to think of them as purely financial assets. Properly designed tokens have specific uses, including as native tokens that incentivize network development and power virtual economies. Tokens are not a sideshow of blockchain networks, a nuisance that can be stripped out and discarded. They are a necessary and central feature. Community ownership doesn’t work unless communities have a way to own.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes people ask if it’s possible to get the benefits of blockchains while removing any hint of the casino by making tokens impossible to trade, through either legal or technical means. If you remove the ability to buy or sell something, however, you remove ownership. Even intangibles, like copyrights and intellectual property, can be bought and sold at their owners’ discretion. No trading means no ownership; you can’t have one without the other.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne interesting question is whether hybrid approaches can tame the casino while still allowing the computer to be built. One proposal would prohibit token reselling after the debut of a new blockchain network, either for some fixed period or until specified milestones are met. Tokens could still be awarded as incentives to grow the network, but token holders might need to wait several years, or until the network hits certain thresholds, before trading restrictions are lifted.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETime horizons can be a very effective way to align people’s incentives with broader, societal interests. Think of the hype cycle described earlier that technologies go through, with the early hype phase followed by a crash and then the “plateau of productivity.” Long-term restrictions force token holders to weather the hype and its aftermath and to realize value by contributing to productive growth.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe industry needs further regulation, to be clear, and that regulation should focus on achieving policy objectives, like punishing bad actors, protecting consumers, providing stable markets, and encouraging responsible innovation. The stakes are high. As I’ve argued throughout “Read Write Own,” blockchain networks are the only known technology that can reestablish an open, democratic internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ELimited Liability Corporations: A Regulatory Success Story\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory shows that smart regulation can accelerate innovation. Until the mid-nineteenth century, the dominant corporate structure was a partnership. In a partnership, all the shareholders are partners and bear full liability for the actions of the business. If the company has a financial loss or causes nonfinancial harm, the liability pierces the corporate shield and falls on the shareholders. Imagine if shareholders of public companies like IBM and GE were personally liable, beyond any money invested, for mistakes the companies made. Very few people would buy stocks, making it much harder for companies to raise capital.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELimited liability corporations did exist back in the early nineteenth century, but were rare. Forming one required a special legislative act. As a result, almost all business ventures were close-knit partnerships among people who deeply trusted one another, like family members or close friends.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis changed during the railway boom of the 1830s and the period of industrialization that followed. Railroads and other heavy industries required significant up-front capital—more than could be provided by small groups, even when the groups were very wealthy. New and broadened sources of capital were needed to fund a transformation of the world economy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you might expect, the upheaval ignited controversy. Lawmakers faced pressure to make limited liability the new corporate standard. Meanwhile, skeptics argued that expanding limited liability would encourage reckless behavior, effectively transferring risk from shareholders to customers and society at large.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the factions settled on a way forward. Industry and lawmakers crafted sensible compromises, arranged legal frameworks, and made limited liability the new norm. This led to the creation of public capital markets for stocks and bonds and all the wealth and wonders those innovations have generated since. Thus, technological innovation drove pragmatic changes to regulation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe history of economic participation is one of increasing inclusion thanks to a combination of tech and legal advances. Partnerships had small groups of owners that counted in the tens. The limited liability structure expanded ownership dramatically, to the point that public companies today have millions of shareholders. Blockchain networks, through mechanisms such as airdrops, grants, and contributor rewards, expand the circle once more. Future networks could have billions of owners.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as industrial-era businesses had new organizational needs, so do network-era businesses today. Corporate networks bolt an old legal structure, C-corporations and LLCs and the like, onto a new network structure. This mismatch is the root cause of many of the problems with corporate networks, including their inexorable switchover from attract to extract mode and the exclusion of so many contributors from the upside of their networks. The world needs new, digitally native ways for people to coordinate, cooperate, collaborate, compete.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains provide a sensible organizational structure for networks. Tokens are the natural asset class. Policymakers and industry leaders can work together to find the right guardrails for blockchain networks, just as their forerunners did for limited liability corporations. The rules should permit and encourage decentralization, not default to centralization as corporate entities do. There are many things that can be done to rein in casino culture while allowing computer culture to develop. Hopefully, smart regulators will encourage innovation and let founders do what they do best—build the future.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe casino should not hold the computer down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis book excerpt, adapted from \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Freadwriteown.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ERead Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet\u003C\u002Fa\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eby Chris Dixon, first\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Cem\u003E appeared on \u003C\u002Fem\u003EFortune&#8217;s \u003Cem\u003Ewebsite on Sunday, March 10, 2024. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

early internet was a magical place because it was driven by people and their creativity. Builders knew that whatever they made, they owned — a simple promise that established the right incentives for the technology to flourish. But now, the internet is stagnating and it’s harder than ever for new apps to break through.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider the app stores: almost all the products that consistently appear on leader lists were founded more than a decade ago: Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), Twitter, now known as X (2006), WhatsApp (2009), Uber (2009), Instagram (2010), Snap (2011) and even Tiktok’s parent ByteDance (2012).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBig Tech consolidated its control of the internet around 2010. Just a few gatekeepers now determine who or what will succeed online. Restoring a vibrant internet means breaking this power and putting users back in the driver’s seat. The key to doing that is creating new networks that cannot be easily usurped — ideally, those \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fread-write-own-intro\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ebuilt on blockchains\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly internet networks, like the web and email, provided a stable foundation upon which people could build businesses and establish a direct connection to their audience. This is no longer the case: networks controlled by the largest tech companies now reach billions, but entrepreneurs and creators have learned just how untrustworthy they can be. These businesses clamp down on application programming interfaces, meddle with mysterious algorithms, and rank content according to opaque and capricious policies. Worse, big tech companies claim most of the revenue that flows through their networks. This stifles creativity, making our online lives poorer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the economics of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Ftags\u002Fnetwork-effects\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Enetwork effects\u003C\u002Fa\u003E: companies provide perks and easy-to-use tools to draw in users — and then, once they are locked in, switch to extracting value from them. A corporate network that doesn’t make this switch will be outcompeted by one that does. It’s impossible to quantify how much innovation and consumer choice has been lost as a result.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome clamor for regulation — though this risks cementing existing power structures. Others focus on reviving early internet protocols, such as plans for so-called federated networks (in which policies are enforced by a central framework), though these are not widely used.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA revitalized internet would require three properties. First, openness: being available to anyone, anywhere. Second, trust: the rules should be transparent, fair and dependable, so builders, creators and users know the network cannot yank the rug out from under them. Finally, all users — not just centralized gatekeepers — should have a say in the networks they contribute to.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworks built on blockchains have all these attributes. While it’s easy to dismiss the technology because of its associations with casino-style gambling behavior — notably FTX and meme coins — it would be a mistake to ignore its potential. Progress towards greater scalability indicates this could be as transformative as the arrival of the PC.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchains are a new class of virtual computer that can, for the first time ever, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fposts\u002Farticle\u002Fcomputers-that-make-commitments\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eestablish inviolable rules in software\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Usually, whoever controls computer hardware can tell the software what to do. But blockchains invert this relationship, preventing those who control a centralized server from arbitrarily changing rules. Unlike traditional computers, blockchains can ensure that any code they run will continue to operate as designed. This could potentially revolutionize the internet’s power dynamics.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworks built on blockchains combine the societal benefits of early internet protocol networks (open access, democratic governance, low take rates and user ownership rights) with the competitive advantages of corporate ones (sustainable sources of funding and advanced features).

note: This is an adapted excerpt from the just-released book \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Freadwriteown.com\u002F#order\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ERead Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by Chris Dixon. The book is now available in the U.S. and in the U.K. for English-language editions; more editions in other languages coming soon. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is probably the most important invention of the twentieth century. It transformed the world much as earlier technological revolutions &#8212; the printing press, the steam engine, electricity &#8212; did before.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike many other inventions, the internet wasn’t immediately monetized. Its early architects created the network not as a centralized organization but as an open platform that anyone &#8212; artists, users, developers, companies, and others &#8212; could access equally. At a relatively low cost and without needing approval, anyone anywhere could create and share code, art, writing, music, games, websites, startups, or whatever else people could dream up.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd whatever you created, you owned. As long as you obeyed the law, no one could change the rules on you, extract more money from you, or take away what you built. The internet was designed to be permissionless and democratically governed, as were its original networks: email and the web. No participants would be privileged over others. Anyone could build on top of these networks and control their creative and economic destinies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis freedom and sense of ownership led to a golden period of creativity and innovation that drove the growth of the internet, leading to countless applications that have transformed our world and the way we live, work, and play.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThen, everything changed. Starting in the mid-2000s, a small group of companies wrenched control away. The internet got intermediated. The network went from permissionless to permissioned.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good news: Billions of people got access to amazing technologies, many of which were free to use. The bad news: A centralized internet run by a handful of mostly ad-based services meant people had fewer software choices, weakened data privacy, and diminished control over their online lives. It also became much harder for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presences without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them and taking away their audiences, profits, and power.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though those platforms deliver significant value to people, they also control what we see and watch. The most visible example of this is deplatforming &#8212; where services eject people, usually without transparent due process. Alternatively, people may get silenced and not even know it &#8212; a practice called shadowbanning. Search and social ranking algorithms can change lives, make or break businesses, and even influence elections.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA subtler and equally troubling point is how these centralized networks restrict and constrain startups, impose high rents on creators, and disenfranchise users. The negative effects of their design choices stifle innovation, tax creativity, and concentrate power and money in the hands of a few.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially dangerous when you consider that the killer app of the internet \u003Cem\u003Eis \u003C\u002Fem\u003Enetworks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of what people do online involves networks: The web and email are networks. Social apps are networks. Payment apps are networks. Marketplaces are networks. Almost every useful online service is a network. Networks &#8212; computing networks, of course; but also developer platforms, marketplaces, financial networks, social networks, and all variety of communities coming together online &#8212; have always been a powerful part of the promise of the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers, entrepreneurs, and everyday internet users have nurtured and nourished tens of thousands of networks, unleashing an unprecedented wave of creation and coordination. Yet the networks that have lasted are mostly owned and controlled by private companies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem stems from \u003Cem\u003Epermission\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Today creators and startups need to ask for permission from centralized gatekeepers and incumbents to launch and grow new products. But dominant tech businesses leverage the power of permission to thwart competition, desolate markets, and extract rents. And those rents are exorbitant: App stores charge up to 30 percent for payments. That’s more than ten times the payment industry norm. Such steep take rates are unheard of in other markets, and they reflect how powerful these companies have become. That’s what we mean when we say corporate networks tax creativity. The taxation is literal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese big, centralized networks are ruthless, anticompetitive, and abuse their power. They squelch competitors, reducing options for consumers. By cutting off third parties that were building apps for users on top of their platforms, they punished many developers &#8212; and therefore punished users by offering fewer products, fewer choices, and less freedom. Today almost no new startup activity takes place on top of social networks. Developers know better than to lay foundations on quicksand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany people don’t see a problem with the way things are, are happy with the status quo, or don’t think much about it. They are satisfied with the comforts afforded by these centralized platforms and networks. We live in an age of abundance, after all. You can connect to anyone you want (assuming the corporate owners are okay with it). You can read, watch, and share as much as you like. There are plenty of “free” services to satiate us &#8212; the price of entry being just our data. (As they say, “If it’s free, then you’re the product.”)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you think the tradeoff is worth it &#8212; or perhaps you see no other viable alternative for life online. Either way, whatever your stance, one trend is undeniable: centralizing forces are drawing the internet inward, collecting power into the center of what was supposed to be a decentralized network.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inward turn of the internet is stifling innovation, making it less interesting, less dynamic, and less fair.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo the extent that anyone recognizes a problem, they usually assume the only way to rein in existing giants is through government regulation. That may be part of the solution. But regulation often has the unintended side effect of cementing existing giants’ power. Larger companies can deal with compliance costs and regulatory complexity that overwhelm smaller upstarts, while red tape restrains newcomers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need a level playing field. And in service of that, we need thoughtful regulation that respects this fundamental truth: startups and technologies offer a more effective way to check incumbents’ power. Moreover, knee-jerk regulatory responses ignore what sets the internet apart from other technologies. Many of the usual calls for regulation assume that the internet is similar to past communications networks, like telephone and cable TV networks. But these older, hardware-based networks are different from the internet, a software-based network. The internet depends, of course, on physical infrastructure owned by telecom providers. But it is the code running at the network edges &#8212; on PCs, phones, and servers &#8212; that drives the behavior of internet services. This code can be upgraded. With the right set of features and incentives, new software can propagate across the internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to its malleable nature, the internet can be reshaped through innovation and market forces. Software is special because it has a nearly unbounded range of expressiveness. Almost anything you can imagine can be encoded in software; software is the encoding of human thought, just like writing or painting or cave drawings. Computers take those encoded thoughts and run them at lightning speeds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why Steve Jobs once described the computer as “a bicycle for the mind.” It accelerates our abilities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware is so expressive that it is better thought of not as engineering, but as an art form. The plasticity and flexibility of code offer an immensely rich design space, far closer in the breadth of possibilities to creative activities like sculpting and fiction writing than engineering activities like bridge building. As with other art forms, practitioners regularly develop new genres and movements that fundamentally shift what’s possible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat’s what’s happening today. Just as the internet seemed to be consolidating beyond repair, a new software movement emerged that can reimagine the internet. The movement has the potential to bring back the spirit of the early internet; secure property rights for creators; reclaim user ownership and control; and break the stranglehold big, centralized companies have on our lives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere’s a better way, and these are still the early days. The internet can still fulfill the promise of its original vision. Entrepreneurs, technologists, creators, and users can make it happen. The dream of an open network that fosters creativity and entrepreneurship doesn’t have to die.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the beginning, not the end, of internet innovation. There’s an urgency to that conviction, though: the United States is already losing its lead in this new movement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERead Write Own: A new movement \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo understand how we got here, it helps to be familiar with the broad strokes of internet history: The first thing to know is that power on the internet derives from how \u003Cem\u003Enetworks\u003C\u002Fem\u003E are designed. Network design &#8212; the way nodes connect, interact, and form an overarching structure &#8212; might seem like an arcane technical topic, but it is the single most relevant factor in determining how rights and money are distributed across the internet. Even small initial design decisions can have profound downstream consequences on the control and economics of internet services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, network design determines outcomes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil recently, networks came in two competing types:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E&#8220;Protocol networks”, like email and the web, are open systems controlled by communities of software developers and other network stakeholders. These networks are egalitarian, democratic, and permissionless: open to anyone and free to access. In these systems, money and power tend to flow to the network edges, incentivizing systems to grow around them.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E“Corporate networks” are networks that companies, instead of communities, own and control. These are like walled gardens with one groundskeeper; they’re theme parks controlled by a single megacorp. Corporate networks run centralized, permissioned services that allow them to quickly develop advanced features, attract investment, and accrue profits to reinvest in growth. In these systems, money and power flow to the network center, to companies that own the networks, and away from users and developers at the network edges.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI see the history of the internet as unfolding in three acts, each marked by a predominating network architecture:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIn the first act, the “read era” (circa 1990-2005) early internet protocol networks democratized information. Anyone could type a few words into a web browser and read about almost any topic through websites.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIn the second act, the “read-write era” (roughly 2006-2020), corporate networks democratized publishing. Anyone could write and publish to mass audiences through posts on social networks and other services.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENow a new type of architecture is enabling the internet’s third act. This architecture represents a natural synthesis of the two prior types, and it is \u003Cem\u003Edemocratizing ownership. \u003C\u002Fem\u003EIn the dawning “read-write-own era,” anyone can become a network stakeholder &#8212; gaining power and economic upside previously enjoyed by only a small number of corporate affiliates, like stockholders and employees.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new era promises to counteract big company consolidation and return the internet to its dynamic roots.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople can read and write on the internet, but they can also now \u003Cem\u003Eown. \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Blockchains” and “blockchain networks” are the technologies driving the movement. This new movement goes by a few names. Some people call it “crypto,” since the foundation of its technology is cryptography. Others call it “web3,” implying that it is leading to a third era of the internet. Whichever name you prefer, the core technology of blockchains presents unique advantages. Blockchain networks are the most credible and civic-minded force to counterbalance internet consolidation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may still be wondering, but so what? What problems do blockchains solve?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome people will tell you that blockchains are a new type of database, one that multiple parties can edit, share, and trust. A better description is that blockchains are a new class of computer, but one you can’t put in your pocket or on your desk, as you might with a smartphone or laptop. They do store information, and run rules encoded in software that can manipulate that information.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the significance of blockchains lies in the unique way that they &#8212; and the networks built on top of them &#8212; are \u003Cem\u003Econtrolled\u003C\u002Fem\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith traditional computers, the hardware controls the software. Hardware exists in the physical world, where an individual or organization owns and controls it. That means that, ultimately, a person or group of people is in charge of both the hardware and the software. People can change their minds, and therefore the software they control, at any time. Blockchains invert the hardware-software power relationship, like the internet before them. With blockchains, the software governs a network of hardware devices. The software &#8212; in all its expressive glory &#8212; is in charge.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does this all matter? Because blockchains are computers that can, for the first time ever, establish inviolable rules in software. This allows blockchains to make strong, software-enforced commitments to users. A pivotal commitment involves digital ownership, which places economic and governance power in the hands of users. The ability for blockchains to make strong commitments about how they will behave in the future allows \u003Cem\u003Enew networks \u003C\u002Fem\u003Eto be created.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlockchain networks therefore solve problems that earlier network architectures can’t solve:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey can connect people in social networks while empowering users over corporate interests.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey can underpin marketplaces and payment networks that facilitate commerce, but with persistently lower take rates.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey can enable new forms of monetizable media, and interoperable and immersive digital worlds.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThey allow artificial intelligence products to \u003Cem\u003Ecompensate\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; rather than \u003Cem\u003Ecannibalize\u003C\u002Fem\u003E &#8212; creators.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, blockchains create networks, but unlike other network architectures &#8212; and here’s the key point &#8212; they have more desirable outcomes: Blockchain networks combine the societal benefits of protocol networks with the competitive advantages of corporate networks. Software developers get open access, creators get direct relationships with their audiences, fees are guaranteed to stay low, and users get valuable economic and governance rights. At the same time, blockchain networks have the technical and financial capabilities to compete with corporate networks. Blockchains therefore can:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eincentivize innovation\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ereduce taxes on creators\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Elet network contributors share in decision making and upside\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAsking “What problems do blockchains solve?” is like asking “What problems does steel solve over, say, wood?” Blockchain networks are a new construction material for building a better internet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe ‘casino vs. the computer’\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENew technologies are often controversial, and blockchains are no exception. Many people associate blockchains with scams and get-rich-quick schemes. There is some truth to these claims, as there was truth to similar claims about tech-driven financial manias of the past &#8212; from the railroad boom of the 1830s to the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. The public discussion mostly focused on IPOs and stock prices, but there were also entrepreneurs and technologists who looked beyond the ups and downs, rolled up their sleeves, and built products and services that eventually delivered on the hype.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were speculators, but there were also builders.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, the same cultural divide exists around blockchains:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOne group &#8212; “the casino” &#8212; is often the much louder of the two, and it is primarily interested in trading and speculation. At its worst, this culture of gambling has led to catastrophes like the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX. This group gets most of the media attention, which influences the public image for the entire category.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe other group &#8212; “the computer” &#8212; is the far more serious of the two, and it is motivated by a long-term vision. This group’s practitioners understand that the financial aspects of blockchains are only a means to an end, a way to align incentives toward a larger goal. They realize the real potential in using blockchains is to build better networks, and therefore a better internet. These people are quieter and don’t get as much attention, but they are the ones who will have lasting effects.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn’t to say the computer culture isn’t interested in making money. We’re a venture capital firm. Most of the tech industry is profit-driven. The difference is that real innovation takes time to generate financial returns. That’s why most venture capital funds (ours included) are structured with purposefully long hold periods. Producing valuable new technologies can take up to a decade and sometimes longer.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComputer culture is long term. Casino culture is not.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, it’s the computer versus the casino battling it out to define the narrative for this software movement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, optimism and cynicism can both be taken too far. The dot-com bubble, followed by bust, reminded many people of that. The way to see the truth is to separate the essence of a technology from specific uses and misuses of it. A hammer can build a home, or it can demolish one. All technologies have the capacity to help or harm; blockchains are no different. The question is, how can we maximize the good while minimizing the bad?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe decisions we make now will determine the internet’s future: who builds, owns, and uses it; where innovation happens; and what the experience will be for everyone. Blockchains, and the networks they enable, unlock the extraordinary power of software as an art form &#8212; with the internet as its canvas.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe movement has an opportunity to change the course of history, to remake humanity’s relationship to the digital, to reimagine what’s possible. Anyone can participate &#8212; whether you’re a developer, creator, entrepreneur, or user. This is a chance to create the internet we want, not the internet we inherited.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Freadwriteown.com\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ELearn more\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
