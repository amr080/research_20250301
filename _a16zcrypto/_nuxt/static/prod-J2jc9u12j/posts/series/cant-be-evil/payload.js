When you buy an NFT today, you’re usually purchasing a tokenID (stored on a blockchain), along with metadata that “points” or refers to some other content file (typically stored off-chain, though there are examples of fully on-chain artwork). This fact causes confusion regarding rights of NFT buyers in the vast majority of cases. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EUS copyright laws do not automatically grant buyers of artwork (both traditional and digital works) the right to reproduce, adapt, or even publicly display the artwork. Without a license or assignment of the copyright from the NFT creator, the buyer cannot exercise any of the rights under copyright (such as reproduction, adaptation, and public display) except through copyright exceptions such as “fair use” which are narrow and uncertain. \u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ELicenses allow creators to grant holders additional rights, but to date, licenses aren’t applied consistently across projects.

When you buy an NFT today, you’re usually purchasing a tokenID (stored on a blockchain), along with metadata that “points” or refers to some other content file (typically stored off-chain, though there are examples of fully on-chain artwork). This fact causes confusion regarding rights of NFT buyers in the vast majority of cases.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUS copyright laws do not automatically grant buyers of artwork (both traditional and digital works) the right to reproduce, adapt, or even publicly display the artwork.

Whereas currently many NFT holders have to trust creators and previous owners to make “not-evil” decisions regarding their NFTs, projects using “Can’t Be Evil” licenses can make NFT ecosystems more trustless, providing holders with a minimum baseline of standard real-world rights, thereby harmonizing real-world ownership with on-chain ownership.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, we’ve developed our licenses with a few defining properties:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EClear and understandable\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“Can’t Be Evil” licenses explicitly outline the buyer’s rights regarding the artwork for their NFTs, including whether these rights are exclusive (only the buyer gets to choose how their NFT artwork is used, and the creator relinquishes all licensed rights); whether they include commercial rights (rights that allow the buyer to use their NFT for business purposes); and whether they allow the buyer to modify, adapt, and create derivatives from their purchased artwork (like changing the appearance of an artwork or using it in a different context).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EBroadly applicable\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cdiv id=\"attachment_2242\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2242 lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F08\u002FCBE_License_Permissive-Chart-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"610\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2242\" data-src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fa16zcrypto.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F08\u002FCBE_License_Permissive-Chart-1.png\" \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp id=\"caption-attachment-2242\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECBE licenses mapped based on permissiveness of rights granted by each license\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch like in traditional creative and open source licensing, where there are a number of open source license models to choose from, we know that not all creators will want to adopt the same form of license for their NFTs.

For example, one of the options creators can choose requires that the license is terminated if the buyer breaches the license or uses the NFT artwork in hate speech.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003ERespectful of modifications and adaptations\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe licenses take a permissive approach to modifications and adaptations to encourage the community-created remixes that have come to define NFT projects and to discourage conflicts within communities. For instance, when a collection has tens of thousands of buyers, it’s possible that some of them will want to use their NFTs in similar ways, whether as branded seltzers or baseball caps or in any other commercial endeavor. Where applicable, the licenses seek to protect the rights of owners across an entire collection to modify and adapt their NFTs in pursuit of such endeavors without increasing the risk of potential disputes among the community.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003ESupportive of transparent sublicensing\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, as soon as someone sells their NFT, the licenses provide that the seller’s license (and any sublicenses the seller may have granted) are terminated, meaning that the full “Can’t Be Evil” licensed rights are passed along to the new owner without any encumbrances. This is critical for protecting potential buyers from unknowingly purchasing an NFT with existing sublicenses that may restrict the buyer’s rights.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this somewhat limits a holder’s ability to grant a perpetual sublicense, it does so only to the extent the holder sells their NFT. Any derivatives they’ve already created can continue to be used if they do not include copyrightable material from the original artwork. Eventually, once transparent and on-chain sublicensing regimes are widely adopted, more open and permissive sublicensing without automatic terminations will be possible, because NFT purchasers will be able to see those sublicenses on-chain and factor them into their decision to purchase the NFT.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003ERespectful of third-party content\u003C\u002Fh5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen one artist uses another’s work to create a new artwork, they can introduce some additional legal risk for buyers, especially if the terms of the collaboration aren’t explicitly laid out.

Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix are all services companies. Even Microsoft is now primarily a services company. This has allowed these companies to outpace the growth of open source software and maintain control of critical internet infrastructure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA core insight in the design of blockchains is that the open source model can be extended beyond software to cloud-based services by adding financial incentives to the mix. Cryptocurrencies &#8212; coins and tokens built into specific blockchains &#8212; provide a way to incentivize individuals and groups to participate in, maintain, and build services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere has been a lot of talk in the past few years about blockchains, which are heavily hyped but poorly understood.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea that an internet service could have an associated coin or token may be a novel concept, but the blockchain and cryptocurrencies can do for cloud-based services what open source did for software. It took twenty years for open source software to supplant proprietary software, and it could take just as long for open services to supplant proprietary services.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the benefits of such a shift will be immense. Instead of placing our trust in corporations, we can place our trust in community-owned and -operated software, transforming the internet’s governing principle from “don’t be evil” back to “can’t be evil&#8221;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis article \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Fstory\u002Fhow-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Eoriginally appeared\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in Wired in January 2019.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
