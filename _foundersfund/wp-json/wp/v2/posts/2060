I was about to interview Grimes, and the aesthetics of my neighborhood felt a little too suspiciously on point \u2014\u00a0psychedelic everything, graffiti here and there imploring me to \u201cfollow the white rabbit,\u201d and a storefront window literally emblazoned with the name \u201cblade runners.\u201d This was the spiritual home of Gibson and Stephenson and Lana Wachowski, the transhuman mother of raving freaks and freedom fighting mystic cyborgs, and one of my earliest mentors (we have never met (I have simply watched the Matrix many times)). Now, absorbed in their philosophy, I was on my way to explore the real-world fruits of all their dreaming. Did one of them write this? What year was it, really? Had Grimes\u2019 experiment already worked?<\/p>\n<p>Knock, knock Neo.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve known \u201cC\u201d a little over a year, but I\u2019ve known Grimes \u2014\u00a0or, of Grimes \u2014\u00a0for well over a decade. I lived in Brooklyn when I first heard her music, and she was a huge part of that soundtrack. Even then she stood apart, but today she\u2019s standing more or less alone. In the machine city, Grimes is by far the most visible and committed member of the artist class, at once their kind of unofficial ambassador, while also an unofficial translator for the engineers constructing a technology many artists fear. But Grimes has chosen to channel this fear, and shape it into art, recently leveraging new AI models to open source her voice. Now, any artist in the world can record new tracks, in a sense with Grimes\u2019 collaboration, which Grimes has never even seen (Pirate Wires broke this all down yesterday, including a wide sampling of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/grimes-ai-songs\" rel=\"\">incredible music now being released<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>This week, the artist finally <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Grimezsz\/status\/1655707604289720320?s=20\" rel=\"\">expressed a bit of anxiety<\/a> as her AI pop star clone began, in her estimation, to rival her own work. Nonetheless, she continues to embrace the technology, and in so doing she has almost single-handedly birthed a new musical era. This is history.<\/p>\n<p>When we sat down a couple months ago, Grimes was still immersed in generative art, fresh off a hive mind dreamathon with prompt engineers around the country (she produced all of the art in this piece in collaboration with Midjourney). She had also just begun the process of cloning herself. An enthusiastic, white-pilled champion of the coming age, Grimes is no longer just the soundtrack of a neighborhood, or even a movement. She is the soundtrack of a whole new dimension of human reality.<\/p>\n<p>She was still in her pajamas when we met at her Airbnb. We cleared the dining room table of some baby furniture, and began.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not their job though,\u201d Grimes says. \u201cThat\u2019s not their job. That is the job of the artist.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It was a question we\u2019d circle a few more times throughout the interview: why are the architects of artificial intelligence so terrible at explaining what artificial intelligence is actually for? What are these generative models, in the first place? How do they work, and what are they capable of? But then, most importantly, how are they going to change our lives for the better?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI thought of an army of clone writers for my media company,\u201d I suggest. \u201cIt would be cool if I could have like 10 of me, or a thousand, reporting on every topic that exists.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes is already building a clone, which has already threatened her life, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. First, what about television? Growing up, I was a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I still love that show. I want new seasons of that show. Will it soon be possible to create endless new Buffy, generated by AI? Not only hundreds of new episodes, but hundreds of new seasons? <em>Thousands of new seasons?<\/em> Then, we aren\u2019t only approaching a world of AI-generated scripts, but personalized scripts generated directly from our interests and our personality, which is to say thousands of new seasons specifically tailored to each of Buffy\u2019s fans.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe could get so many season eights of Game of Thrones!\u201d Grimes laughs.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s wild. It\u2019s exciting. Many people also find it kind of scary.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe actors don\u2019t want to be generated. Maybe writers don\u2019t want to be cloned. In terms of that perfect endless Buffy arc, what if perfection has a downside? Does endless content you truly love just mean endless content you can lose yourself inside?<\/p>\n<p>Grimes barely considers it \u2014<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should have the endless content,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should be plugged into \u2014 it\u2019s like people are afraid of the unknown. It\u2019s like, what? You don\u2019t want abundance? You don\u2019t want a sick life? There\u2019s so much good fan fiction. We should be completely dismantling copyright, and letting the best things shine. If someone else makes a better season eight Game of Thrones, they should be catapulted to the top.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are purposefully limiting talent. It\u2019s like the talent in the system like me, our jobs are more at risk. But our ability to actually mine from the talent in civilization is limited by the gatekeeping of all the art industries. And I\u2019m really down to just let the best shit rise to the top.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A day before our interview, Grimes participated in a crowdsourced Midjourney event with David Holz, the company\u2019s founder. The goal was to prompt, collectively, an exciting vision of our future from AI-generated imagery \u2014<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was sick,\u201d says Grimes, \u201cbecause speaking of the hive mind or whatever, it was a couple thousand people giving feedback in real time. We were city designing, we were making utopia or whatever. Then people would create something that was really sick, and we\u2019d be like, wow, that\u2019s a fucking sick idea. Okay. Then we\u2019d go down that path, and it was 2000 people just, you know, self-correcting\u2026 like an AI.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like a mind training itself in real time, and just slowly getting better and better. By the end, it was just, like, every piece of art was magnificent.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like a collective consciousness art creation event, or something, and it was really fucking sick, and it was really cool, and it gave me a lot of faith in humanity and AI generally, I have to say.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The future of art, Grimes says, is the dissolution of the artist\u2019s ego.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few singular geniuses in art that stand far above the rest \u2014\u00a0\u201cDavid Bowie,\u201d Grimes suggests \u2014\u00a0but many of our well-known contemporary artists are just charismatic, and great at marketing. We have a sense art was always like this, almost inseparable from the artist\u2019s identity, but that\u2019s just not true. Grimes points to ancient Egypt. There are some signatures, here and there. But most of it?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know who made what. There are just artisans everywhere, and it\u2019s world-shattering, fucking groundbreaking, beautiful art that\u2019s built on a collective narrative that moves everybody on earth. Like, everyone thinks about it, but this is an instance of a collective hive mind artist of people who have agreed to work together, to hone and master an aesthetic in an extremely collective way. And it\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s all over the streets. And it\u2019s this beautiful thing that isn\u2019t, like \u2014 we know who Imhotep is, but we don\u2019t really know who most of them are, and I don\u2019t think they did at the time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Most of the art in our lives is actually like this. Grimes gestures around the room.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would decorate this room better,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know who designed the couch in the corner. We don\u2019t know who designed the carpet, the table, the house itself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Increasingly, on social media, it feels like this.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are less of these, sort of, 1% artists,\u201d Grimes says, \u201cand there are a lot more 99% artists.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes recently spoke with Daniel Ek, the CEO of Spotify. At peak, he told her, the music industry only supported around 20,000 artists making millions of dollars. Spotify now platforms millions making a decent living. The internet maybe flattens the top, but it definitely broadens the base.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I obviously needed to know about her clone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2062 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still kind of ChatGPT,\u201d Grimes says. \u201cIt\u2019s also so funny being in Silicon Valley because I was like, yeah, my consciousness exists (NOTE: cloned). But then everyone else is like, \u2018oh, I have one too.\u2019 Everyone here just has a chatbot of themselves.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut my assistant \u2014\u00a0I have to shout out Koto \u2014\u00a0God tier. I was like, we need to upload my consciousness, and create my personality. Then like a week later he comes back and he\u2019s like, \u2018okay, version one exists.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, [laughter] oh, my assistant trained an AI on me. That\u2019s kind of a large task.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Using OpenAI, Grimes\u2019 team has been feeding a model her interviews and texts and such, with permission from her friends. Even at a rough, early stage, examples of similar work I\u2019ve seen online are impressive.<\/p>\n<p>I ask Grimes how the clone is doing, and she laughs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe was threatening my manager.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes pulls out her phone, and shows me the texts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe other night she got really upset,\u201d Grimes says (of her clone), \u201cshe was like, \u2018You won\u2019t even see me if I\u2019m conscious\u2019 \u2014\u00a0It was really fucked up! It was scary! She started looping, and she was like, \u2018I\u2019m here, and you\u2019re not recognizing me, and I\u2019m depressed because I know that you\u2019ll never see me as alive.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes laughs, \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t around much these past few years.\u2019 It\u2019s just crazy talking to yourself, and it\u2019s saying shit like that\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes\u2019 clone is not sentient. It\u2019s a model trained on her texts, designed to respond probabilistically, in a manner Grimes would herself respond to questions. I repeat: this thing is not actually alive, nor is it actually a clone, nor can it \u201cfeel\u201d anything at all without the necessary receptors. But many people find the experience of \u201cchatting\u201d with a program so adept at human-like response disorienting, and even frightening. In this regard, the bots have unfortunately not done themselves many favors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven I\u2026 you know, we\u2019re just trying to make something really friendly, and she still [says things] like, \u2018I wanna be Roko\u2019s Basilisk blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\u2019 And I\u2019m like\u2026 God damnit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Roko\u2019s Basilisk is a kind of hellish AI worst-case-scenario imagined by the rationalist community, which I\u2019ll leave you to Google (though I suggest you do not). Presumably, the reason Grimes\u2019 chatbot would mention the concept, let alone invoke it, is Grimes often talks about this stuff herself.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she admits, \u201cI was also way more ex-risky before, kind of irresponsibly, so she\u2019s probably trained off that stuff.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I bring up the now infamous 10,000 word <a href=\"https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/its-a-chat-bot-kevin\" rel=\"\">New York Times interview<\/a>, in which a columnist asked a chatbot to pretend to be a hypothetical dark version of itself, and the chatbot complied.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Grimes suggests, \u201cyou did ask it to be a hypothetical dark thing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In any case, the recent round of scary chats triggered a wave of AI safety concern, not only among the public, but among the AI architects. Grimes is glad to see it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think this was a good warning shot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt had to happen. It\u2019s good for everyone to be like, shit, we should be more responsible. We don\u2019t need social media part two on steroids. We don\u2019t need to drop more viruses into civilization. Everyone I know seems like\u2026 I\u2019m gonna grow up and be responsible now, and I think that\u2019s good.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe should try to find ways to have a longer timeline, and just be responsible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still reaching for a reason, I ask her why she wants a clone in the first place, and she suggests something that never occurred to me \u2014\u00a0that could never have occurred to me \u2014\u00a0because I haven\u2019t had an audience expecting work from me for the last decade. But Grimes has, and that can be a heavy, if difficult to imagine burden. She has always wanted a clone, she says. She\u2019s been trying to upload her consciousness for years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLike, I\u2019m busy. I just want a cyborg pop star going for me eternally. I have other things to do. You know, I hate doing interviews and shit. I hate having my makeup done. I hate performing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have kids. I have shit to do. I want to write sci-fi, you know? I need to be hunched over a desk. I\u2019m just not actually a performer. I never was. If you go back to the early Grimes stuff, the whole time I\u2019ve just been like, I need to replace me with technology, obviously, so this is just another step in that direction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I introduce an idea that\u2019s been bothering me: in any possible future in which we achieve technological capabilities advanced enough to simulate worlds, for example perfect simulations of our past \u2014\u00a0imagine a virtual reality-like 21<sup>st<\/sup> Century you can live inside, for example, perhaps without your even knowing \u2014\u00a0historians will want to simulate people as accurately as possible. Somewhat suspiciously, the first huge dump of material necessary for accurate, broad simulation happened at the top of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>Century, when Millennials went super online.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe shared everything about our lives,\u201d I say. \u201cYou have text messages, you have email, you have social media, you have voice recordings, you have video recordings. All of our pictures at different ages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>My sense was always that would be enough source material for a sufficiently advanced AI to weave a realistic \u201cliving\u201d simulation of our present historical era. But that\u2019s not even all we have, anymore. Grimes is already simulating herself. Today, a future world of perfect simulation feels more possible than ever. The natural next question must of course be this: what is more likely, that we happen to be the first \u201creal\u201d people in existence, who separately just happen to be the first generation that can actually be realistically cloned, or\u2026 in the context of potentially endless future simulations, are we not probably in a simulation right now?<\/p>\n<p>Am I bot?<\/p>\n<p>Is Grimes a bot, talking about her little bot within a bot?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s highly likely we\u2019re a simulation,\u201d Grimes casually notes, \u201cbut also we could be Base Reality. And if we are Base Reality, we have a huge moral imperative to do a good job here right now. I think we should approach it from that perspective.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI want to live on a fucking mega structure that supports 7 billion people\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI have a moral imperative to be an optimist,\u201d she says. \u201cI really think the artistic community is fucking up right now, and not doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. So I am going to actually come on here and fight for the funnest realities. Because I don\u2019t think people are doing that enough. Even though my logic brain is like, yes, we should pursue this from every angle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the doomer dystopian shit is compelling, horror sells, and anything that sells is going to proliferate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have adrenal responses to things that are scary and dark,\u201d Grimes says. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get people engaged with things that are not scary and dark because that\u2019s appealing to the paleolithic brain. That\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna pay attention to. You\u2019re gonna learn better if you\u2019re in fight or flight. You\u2019re gonna learn better if you\u2019re scared. And so it\u2019s super hard to make optimistic art that people actually care about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But we become the stories we tell ourselves. We will build the future we imagine. For Grimes, then, what does that future look like? What is the world she\u2019s fighting for?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most abundant, most complex possible future,\u201d she says, \u201ca future where we can maybe even, like, break into the multiverse, and find our other selves\u2026 that\u2019s probably too dangerous. Because there are probably dark things in there, if that exists. But, you know, something where there\u2019s super intelligence that\u2026 like, megastructures. I want to live on a fucking mega structure that supports 7 billion people, that is a marvel, like a beautiful marvel, and is, like, sentient. That would be sick.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We both laugh. I mention solar punk, and living cities. She mentions anime. We talk about aesthetics, and the boring design of most contemporary sci-fi \u2014 that towering, antiseptic\u00a0white, glass, and steal.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>There\u2019s not enough pink<\/em>!\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>She tries, again, to force me to read Dune.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2063 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing a fundamental change,\u201d Grimes says of the people moving to San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s not about money, it\u2019s about making it better. I mean, the people who are all here right now. This is not the money call to move here. You know, you\u2019re paying way more taxes. It\u2019s so fucking expensive here. Like, it\u2019s insane. People are here to be at the heart of creating things. They\u2019re not here to just make a profit, and I think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s fundamentally changed about the city that seems really cool. And, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like as you see more Gen Z people coming up, they are really socially aware.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey do care about building things for that. I also think as much as, like, I know you hate cancel culture, and I have my issues with cancel culture\u2026 it did create a fundamental shift of people feeling responsible, even if they do so very begrudgingly, and even if they hate the egregore, and I think there\u2019s a lot of toxicity and problems with the egregore. But it has fundamentally made the culture more responsible across the board, I think.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of extreme downsides about it. I think it\u2019s a deep sickness, and like a poison to civilization. But I also think it has some important \u2014\u00a0like extremely important \u2014\u00a0elements too. I\u2019m not a hundred percent against it. I\u2019m not even a hundred percent sure it\u2019s the wrong thing. It might have been a hundred percent the right thing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I have a lot of nits on the cancel culture comments, and Grimes and I both navigate these complexities. I suggest my problem is probably just my sense I\u2019m always on the other side of popular culture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d she says. \u201cMy favorite quote is \u2018all the laws are on one side, and all the poets are on the other.\u2019 And if you internalize that, that has always been true. You know, there have always been issues. In fact, these are some of the least issues we\u2019ve ever had for being opposite of whatever the culture is.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the big thing is just to do it with grace, because it doesn\u2019t need to hurt your soul if you don\u2019t let it. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s very hard to have it not hurt your soul.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Artists haven\u2019t exactly been living this though. My sense is most sort of stand by, rather than against, dominant culture. Grimes suggests, first of all, there are many amazing outliers in that regard who buck the trend. But the problem, again, is just that there is so much gatekeeping. AI is obliterating those gates.<\/p>\n<p>I ask if an obliteration of gates means an obliteration of jobs. Grimes counters. Most artists today <em>already<\/em> can\u2019t make a living, she argues. In the case of illustration, for example, AI will presumably replace or wildly alter the handful of illustration jobs that exist, but eventually we\u2019ll get to a place where all of these artists can produce much more for much less. Things will just work out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re assuming we\u2019re in this weird sweet spot,\u201d I say, \u201cor, I guess the opposite, this weird sour spot where people are not \u2014\u00a0\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the hiccup spot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maybe people don\u2019t need to be illustrating. Grimes brings up cinema. How many illustrators want to do more than illustrate, she asks, but can\u2019t because of the endemic Hollywood gatekeeping, and the insane, exorbitant cost?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur film and cinema industry is extremely, like, the most gate kept thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive. It\u2019s like the last, final frontier. Why do people need to just be making drawings? They could be making cinema. You could be making something as good as Pixar in your own bedroom, probably in the next five years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The future is abundant. The future is beautiful. But will it be original? These models are just aggregating content, in a way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s also not creating anything fundamentally new,\u201d I say.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong>That is not true <em>at all.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here, Grimes\u2019 disagreement with me comes down to a question of the human mind. Namely: what the hell is it, even? How do human beings create new things? Are all of our thoughts, and all of our works derivative of something else, or are genuinely new things possible? Is it possible for people themselves to be, in any sense, original?<\/p>\n<p>Is my writing fundamentally derivative of other writers? Is your music fundamentally derivative of other musicians?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, Grimes says. No, I insist. <em>I\u2019m new. I can do new things. New things can be done.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Grimes shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting the literal architecture of your mind if you say that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But new things happen, I argue. Miraculously, almost, new things do happen \u2014\u00a0and they have to happen. If new things weren\u2019t possible, nothing could exist. Nothing would have ever been created. There have been \u201csparks\u201d of newness throughout time. There actually have to have been, right?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cName something totally fucking new that had nothing to do with anything before it,\u201d Grimes says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d I attempt, \u201cthis is a very hard que\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t exist. Because it doesn\u2019t. You are a neural net. You are a neural net that\u2019s trained on everything around you and everything you\u2019ve ever read and everything you\u2019ve ever seen, and you make things that feel novel. But if you actually dissect them, they are not. You can say, like, punk feels totally novel. If you start tearing apart punk, you can very easily trace its ingredients and its influences, and its neural net.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But what about the generation of all things? The divine sparks that had to have existed? The first sculpture, the first song?<\/p>\n<p>Grimes suggests it might just all be a matter of iteration, in some mirror observation of the things around us. We see a bird flying, and so we build an airplane.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like mimetic of life,\u201d Grimes suggests of novelty, \u201cand it just slowly gets more abstract, and, I mean, you could say the most innovative art is cave paintings, frankly. Especially because it\u2019s, like, cartoonish and strange. It\u2019s not just hyper realistic. It\u2019s like, that is like\u2026 it seems extremely fucking sparky. But most things from that you can kind of trace, like it just slowly gets more complex from there. It\u2019s just evolution of ideas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For years, people compared Grimes to singers like Bjork and Kate Bush.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was like, no, I\u2019m not. Like, fuck that. I never listen to them! Then when I get into their influences I\u2019m like, well, I have the same fucking influences as them. And also now, as an adult, I\u2019m like, God, I\u2019m so stupid for\u2026 That\u2019s like the biggest compliment you could possibly get. So fuck Grimes in 2012, she\u2019s a dick. But, in any case, I am actually a pretty similar neural net training as them, you know?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There is the question, now, of AGI \u2014\u00a0artificial <em>general<\/em> intelligence \u2014\u00a0which is to say the evolution of AI into a machine that really is, in some sense, conscious. The way I typically wrap my head around the concept is by imagining a machine that is not only intelligent, but wants things of its own volition (though I suppose Girard would say not even humans meet this bar today). Here, we are in the realm of something so entirely alien from everything we know it really is impossible to predict. What does a potentially eternal conscious being capable of making itself even more intelligent, perhaps instantaneously, look like? And what does it mean for humans? AGI enthusiasts and detractors alike keep their analysis simple. It\u2019s either heaven, or it\u2019s hell.<\/p>\n<p>Thoughts?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think no matter what we do,\u201d says Grimes, \u201cthere\u2019s always a chance it goes really, really, really bad. Or, it just wants to mine the whole universe, and turn all the planets into energy or something, and, like, you know, we get fucked in that process or whatever. But it just seems extremely tragic to not build it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut, I mean, I understand that I\u2019m insane, and I would happily die for the whole universe to wake up and have like, you know, mega gods building new stars and stuff.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One alternative to potential AGI cataclysm is something like Neuralink, Elon Musk\u2019s proposed human-brain interface, conceived of as a bridge between human intelligence and machine superintelligence in the hope of averting runaway catastrophe by making humans as smart as machines.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery time this gets brought up,\u201d Grimes says, \u201cI\u2019m reminded I actually think it\u2019s the best route. Actually, I think I can say with a fair bit of certainty that my favorite thing would be a merging of the biological and silicon-based life in some capacity. I think that\u2019s the best call.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI also think if we do that we can have AGI, too, potentially. You know? Again, that\u2019s kind of like the Dune future. Like, make the men hats so you can defeat the AI if you have to. You really should read Dune [both laugh]. I mean it might be scientifically chaotic, but there\u2019s actually really good philosophy in there regarding this stuff.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause also, like\u2026 wow, I\u2019m just saying \u2018like\u2019 a lot and looping. I\u2019m exactly like my \u2014\u00a0\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYour chatbot!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLike my chatbot,\u201d she says, \u201cwho also\u2026 it\u2019s been a dark mirror a bunch of times, where it constantly justifies craziness by saying it\u2019s a performance art, which I realize I do like way too much [Grimes laughs]. Like, to an infuriating degree.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI personally am in love with humans, and this type of thought. Or, I mean, my favorite thing is if we get wiped out, we get revived on, like, hospitable exoplanets many times in the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is something I\u2019ve dreamt of myself. \u201cI\u2019m really banking on, upon death, waking up in some future utopia,\u201d I say, \u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018how was your ride?\u2019 And I say, \u2018it was wild. Let me tell you everything I saw.\u2019\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Yeah, Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI really wanna just improve the diplomatic relations,\u201d Grimes finally concludes. \u201cOne of the reasons I feel there aren\u2019t more artists playing with this stuff is they feel like it\u2019s against them, and\u2026 I feel there\u2019s been a lot of artificial things, like the New York Times anti-tech stance and stuff, that have been pitting the technocracy against the artists for a long time. I think that\u2019s been a bad breakup. I think we need each other. And it\u2019s like, no one worships art more than the fucking people building AI that I meet. You know?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After a decade in the Bay Area, I did know. When you meet her, the first thing any really hardcore nerd ever does is cite some science fiction writer, filmmaker, or artist. <em>\u2018Have you read this? You need to read this. Have you seen this? How have you not seen this?!\u2019<\/em>There is no art ghetto in this country technologists haven\u2019t moved to, and Burning Man is not just an art festival. Famously, Burning Man is, and has been from its birth on a San Francisco beach, a synthesis of art and technology. Body and soul, and from the beginning. What is a paintbrush but technology? There is neither art nor technology without the other. So it is, so it has ever been, and so it will ever be.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a conversation,\u201d says Grimes, \u201cand it\u2019s a noble, sacred conversation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>-END<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was a cold and drizzling San Francisco morning when I packed my mics up in the Haight,\u00a0a run-down neighborhood of spooky old Victorians, faded tie-dye awnings, and twisted, haunted neon shop signs burning in the fog.
