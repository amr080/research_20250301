Most new ideas are wrong, or useless. Some are even dangerous. But from science and technology to business and faith, progress is a history of persecuted weirdos, so that is where we stand, and that is what we celebrated. In conversation, no topic was off limits: genetic modification, natalism, parapsychology, artificial consciousness, defense, pharmacology, virology, sex, God. There were lectures, there were performances, there was, randomly and happily, a marriage. Two babies were conceived at the event, two more because of it (that we know of), and new ideas were shared in quantities at least as great as drinks consumed. Obviously, we\u2019re doing it again. But this October, while our hope is still for guests to come and speak their mind \u2014 prepare your take, your talk, your robust defense of whatever heretical concept you believe a worthy cause \u2014 we\u2019d like to introduce a frame for your consideration: the end of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, Americans have obsessed with the question of our impending doom, captured especially by the role of technology in humanity\u2019s looming final chapter, though here perspectives tend to bifurcate. First, from our nascent class of celebrity safetyists, we\u2019re told mankind\u2019s technological destruction is certain unless we halt interrogation and development of every field from synthetic biology to advanced computing, reducing the imagined existential risk of novel technologies to something close to zero. Concurrently, from the accelerating techno-optimists, we\u2019re told only good has ever come, and can ever come, of technological advance. Both positions are wrong. Amidst the lingering consequences of what was probably a lab made pandemic, heightened political turmoil in a world of nuclear weapons, and, as mankind\u2019s first synthetic mind comes closer by the day to waking up, the unknowable implications of general artificial intelligence, the truth is we are clearly at risk of cataclysm. But that is the corollary of life in an age of wonder, a precious gift impossible without the natural dangers inherent of tremendous progress. In other words: yes, we are at risk of the apocalypse, and that is good.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the ground floor, there is some benefit in a simple discussion of risk and reward.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humans are designed to predict and manage danger, so that\u2019s the future we imagine in its greatest detail. But on close examination of each dystopian fantasy, there tends to be an interesting inversion: man-made climate change will kill us all, but what does that imply but humans can control the weather? The architecture of deadly new pathogens whispers of synthetic support for human immunity \u2014 an army of nanobots patrolling your bloodstream. The catastrophic blight of crops inherent of the GMO dystopias also implies, before any blight is possible, an abundance of food unprecedented in human history. Afraid of a world where genetically modified superhumans discriminate against the average guy? Consider for a moment you just used the word \u201csuperhuman,\u201d and believed designing supermen was possible. From extinction to de-extinction, and the return of the wooly mammoth (table stakes). From rising seas to seaflooding, and the resurrection of the great Sahara plains. I see your paperclip maximizer, and raise you the Diamond Age of cities woven up, in seconds, from the Martian sands.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>In the spirit of Hereticon, we invite you all \u2014 technologists, entrepreneurs, and every manner of creative dissident \u2014 to come and share your wildest dreams<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with a special invitation for the most dedicated doomers and recklessly-accelerating techno-utopianists to meet and talk and yell and drink and have another few kids, who knows. What are the risks before us? What are the dangers we haven\u2019t yet imagined? But then we\u2019d like to pose another question, almost never considered in our ostensibly progressing society: what are the elements of our world actually worth saving?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider our rotting cities. Consider this election, and yet again, as chanted every year in unison, the common notion we must choose between a \u201clesser of two evils.\u201d Consider our perpetual war machine. Consider our corrupted language, and what\u2019s become of \u201cscience.\u201d Consider the overly-medicated modern man\u2019s atomization, and commodification, doomscrolling, or swiping profiles of people he will never meet, or chatting with (a person posing as) his favorite prostitute online, face lit blue before he goes to sleep each night alone in his box. Consider the world as it stands today, not as you\u2019d like it to stand, but as it really presents. How much of this should be preserved?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe if you aren\u2019t trying to destroy the world, you aren\u2019t trying hard enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just a thought. Come agree and disagree and share your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the evening of October 28<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the morning of the 31<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019re hosting Hereticon II, an End of the World\u2019s Fair, and a feast for the mind.

Much of the current debate within the U.S. technology community tends to frame the issues in binary terms: technologists have a choice \u2014 to participate in the \u201cbusiness of war\u201d (as a <a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/files\/2018\/technology\/googleletter.pdf\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">recent letter<\/a> by Google employees put it) and become complicit in war\u2019s consequences, or to withdraw from work with the defense community completely. The tech community\u2019s ambivalence regarding the defense sector is understandable. In the post-Cold War geopolitical environment, our collective memory of conflict (to the extent there is one) has too often been characterized by recent experiences of failed nation-building, unmet aspirations for globalization, and the rise of populism.<\/p>\n<p id=\"5ed0\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The current debate frames a false choice, however. It is clear that emerging technologies will force a shift in the way wars are initiated, waged, resolved, and most importantly, deterred. The technology industry cannot divest from the defense sector without ceding ground to our adversaries, who are accelerating their investment in their own defense technologies. American technologists should not view these adversaries as our moral equivalent: Governments such as the Chinese Communist Party or Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia are operating illiberal and closed societies, and in the past decade, they have leveraged these same technologies to annex territories, interfere in global conflicts (and domestic elections), and systematically subjugate dissidents and minorities. These governments also require their technology industries to support their illiberal ambitions. This also makes America different \u2014 and better. American technologists are not required to work on behalf of their nation\u2019s defense, but in choosing not to do so, they must recognize that they are ceding an advantage to illiberal rivals and putting the very freedom and openness that they cherish at risk.<\/p>\n<p id=\"9973\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The critical question is not whether the technology industry should participate in the defense sector, but how we do so ethically. This question has consumed me for more than a decade. I have used and built defense technologies, and in recent years, I have directed national security technology investments at a leading venture capital firm, <a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;http:\/\/www.foundersfund.com\/\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Founders Fund<\/a>, where the ethical standards of the products, companies, and founders that we invest in are critical considerations.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The overriding lesson that I have drawn from these experiences is that responsible technological investment in the defense sector is critical to our ability to deter unnecessary wars, and make the conduct of wars that we do wage more ethical and consistent with our values as a free and open society.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"dda3\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The technology of warfare, like any other technology, can be misused and abused. But it can also be designed and used to deter violence, to reduce casualties and the loss of life, to mitigate bias and misuse, to enforce accountability in the use of force, and, when violence is necessary, to make it quick and precise, leading to a rapid victory rather than an extended conflict. The technology industry can and should play a critical role in achieving these outcomes.<\/p>\n<p id=\"6663\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The role of technology in making warfare more ethical is an important topic that has not received the nuanced and substantive coverage it deserves outside of the defense sector. It is also a topic to which humans have given considerable thought through the ages. The ethics of war and some of the key frameworks from that literature can provide critical guidance for how we should think about new challenges posed by emerging technologies and how we should ethically develop, invest in, and utilize these capabilities for defense and national security purposes. Indeed, the principled framework of Just War Theory provides a structured roadmap for thinking about the ethical issues raised by the intersection of emerging technology and national defense.<\/p>\n<p id=\"7222\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Frameworks established by Just War Theory first emerged thousands of years ago and have been discussed and debated at great length by philosophers, historians, and theologians of nearly every faith tradition in the years since. Concepts emerging from this dialogue have been adopted and codified in national laws around rules of engagement, such as the <a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/dod.defense.gov\/Portals\/1\/Documents\/pubs\/DoD%20Law%20of%20War%20Manual%20-%20June%202015%20Updated%20Dec%202016.pdf?ver=2016-12-13-172036-190\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">US Law of War<\/a>, in international treaties, such as the <a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/genocideprevention\/documents\/atrocity-crimes\/Doc.32_GC-III-EN.pdf\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Geneva Conventions<\/a>, and in the founding documents of international organizations, such as the <a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/charter-united-nations\/\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">UN Charter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"5325\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While a variety of concepts and naming conventions exist inside the Just War tradition, I will focus here on four organizing principles: The Principle of Last Resort, The Principles of Discrimination and Proportionality (grouped together), and The Principles of Just Authority &amp; Right Intent. This overview is intended as a catalyst for further, and much needed, discussion on this issue within the technology and defense communities, rather than a definitive treatment of the questions.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"5fca\" class=\"nm nn gh be no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj bj\"><strong class=\"al\">The Principle of Last Resort<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p id=\"0d2a\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls ok lu lv lw ol ly lz ma om mc md me on mg mh mi oo mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em class=\"ni\">\u201cWhat is the evil in War?

There are various mechanisms available to exercise this preference: diplomatic intervention, punitive economic policies (embargoes, tariffs), pressure from the international community and deterrence. Advanced technology can be a tremendous asset to avoiding and deterring unnecessary war.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ff23\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For most of modern history, the threat of punishment imposed by one or more sovereigns for violations of that sovereignty, or grievous offense to moral or international law and norms, has served as a deterrent against bad action. This system worked reasonably well, but only in the case where a massive power imbalance existed.<\/p>\n<p id=\"b0ac\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The advent of nuclear weapons affected this historical calculus more than any other development to date. During the Cold War, punitive nuclear deterrence broadly assured that the world would not slip into global-scale conflict akin to the world wars. The costs were too high and the threat was believable. Proxy wars were waged, but the US and Soviet Union were generally mindful of \u2014 and avoided \u2014 any conflict that might incite nuclear war.<\/p>\n<p id=\"81e4\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But deterrence provided by nuclear weapons has eroded greatly since the end of the Cold War. The threat of nuclear retaliation is not especially believable, particularly in a world in which numerous smaller powers have acquired their own nuclear capabilities and mutually assured destruction seems to be the most likely outcome of any significant engagement.<\/p>\n<p id=\"cd88\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As part of this transition out of Cold War engagements, the United States began investing heavily in the development of conventional capabilities that could play a role in continued punitive deterrence, including precision-strike weapons, stealth technologies, and unmanned aircraft. This worked for a time, as can be seen by conflicts with the Taliban, Hussein, and Milosevic. But, over the past decade or so, the deterrent impact of America\u2019s lead in conventional precision strike warfare has similarly eroded as China, Russia, and increasingly Iran and North Korea, have invested large sums of time and money into developing their own conventional capabilities to match ours. Innovative autocratic regimes have simultaneously also worked to adopt strategies to move quickly in deniable ways to achieve their objectives before the US and our allies can respond militarily. This tactic was clearly on display during Russia\u2019s invasion and occupation of Georgia and Ukraine, which hardly evoked a response from the international community.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Technology development will play a critical deterrent role in a post-nuclear society, both as a neutralizer of nuclear and conventional threats as well as in shifting the cost of conflict to the aggressor.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"eef5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">There is a long history of investment in anti-ballistic missile programs by the US and the Soviet Union, most of which have had modest results. These and related technologies are a critical area of continued investment, if only to ensure that we maintain or exceed peace-preserving balance between nuclear powers that currently exists. Similarly, we need to be thinking critically about how to defend our military and our allies against large salvos of conventional munitions, unmanned aircraft, hypersonics, and the like. In the coming years, it will be incredibly important to develop improved early-warning systems, directed energy missile defense, hypervelocity defensive systems, sensor fusion and situational awareness, sense-making artificial intelligence, and automated command &amp; control. For instance, the recent destruction of Saudi Oil facilities (reportedly by the Iranian regime) could have been deterred or avoided if US allies had effective counter-cruise missile, counter-drone, and related technology to stop the attack. These are technologies worth investing in.<\/p>\n<p id=\"234a\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">These defensive technologies also increase the cost of conflict by making it significantly harder to inflict violence on the US or its allies without being caught or suffering significant losses in the process. One can imagine that the deployment of Russian troops to Ukraine, Crimea, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia, or the attack on Aramco would have been more difficult if our allies in the region were armed with more defensive capabilities \u2014 such as those mentioned above \u2014 which shift a greater share of the cost of the conflict on the invading force. This movement towards deterrence by denial rather than punishment is drawn out in great detail by Congressman Mike Gallagher in a <a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/mca-marines.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Rep.-Gallagher-State-of-Deterrence-by-Denial.pdf\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">recent piece in Washington Quarterly<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"a1ea\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In similar fashion, numerous non-lethal and non-kinetic technologies have continued in development that allow for improved conflict de-escalation, thereby making physical violence even more of a last resort. These capabilities (such as electronic warfare and cyber) tend to be more covert and deniable as well, which can make it more possible for states to respond to aggression or deter it in advance through means that clearly convey intent to the aggressor but still allow for them to off-ramp and save face. As militaries become more defined by information technologies and AI, these kinds of capabilities will become all the more important in future war.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"cffc\" class=\"nm nn gh be no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj bj\">The Principles of Discrimination and Proportionality<\/h4>\n<p id=\"259d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls ok lu lv lw ol ly lz ma om mc md me on mg mh mi oo mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Where the use of force is necessary, Just War requires that it be deployed ethically and consistently with the principles of discrimination and proportionality. Discrimination deals with the determination of who is considered a legitimate target in war and proportionality deals with the concern of how much force is morally appropriate. These two principles are often discussed separately, but in the case of evaluating in the context of technology development it makes sense to discuss them in concert with one another. Defense technology can play an important role in enforcing these principles.<\/p>\n<p id=\"0df8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Historians of war note that weapons development has been focused on increasing the size and scope of destruction:<\/p>\n<p id=\"0ebc\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"lr gi\">One-to-one<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"9a19\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Swords, knives, arrows<\/p>\n<p id=\"4453\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"lr gi\">One-to-some<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"18a0\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Cannons, trebuchet, catapult<\/p>\n<p id=\"3c5c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"lr gi\">One-to-many<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"41f8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Explosive ordinance, chemical and biological, nuclear<\/p>\n<p id=\"fbf6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">These early developments (i.e., transitioning from fists and knives to nuclear weapons) came largely at the expense of both discrimination and proportionality.<\/p>\n<p id=\"ab62\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">More recently, however, military technology development has focused significantly on a return to more precise and discriminate targeting:<\/p>\n<p id=\"f3f1\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"lr gi\">One-to-some \/ some-to-some<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"7f4b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Precision-fire weapons, long-range IR target-finding gunships, small diameter bombs, battlefield awareness software, high-resolution imaging, autonomous unmanned aerial systems, computer-guided counter-missile\/rocket platforms, AI-powered warning systems<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This represents a huge shift in warfare and defense.

This debate is critical and should be continued (my preliminary views on how the debate has been framed are expressed <a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/silicon-valley-should-stop-ostracizing-the-military\/2018\/08\/08\/7a7e0658-974f-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">here<\/a> and the Defense Innovation Board released a brilliant report diving into specifics around this which can be accessed <a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/innovation.defense.gov\/ai\/\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">here<\/a>). While we must continue to pay close scrutiny to questions such as accountability and transparency in any military use of AI (and related questions regarding whether\/when a human should be \u201cin the loop\u201d in such systems), we should also not lose sight of the ways in which AI can be deployed to make warfare <em class=\"ni\">more <\/em>ethical. This shift is not wholly new. Continued improvement of AI for national security continues the decades-long trend toward precision weapons and will contribute to moving us away from the indiscriminate bombing campaigns that were the hallmark of warfare for the entirety of the 20th century.<\/p>\n<p id=\"fec4\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Similarly, the use of autonomous robots or drones to investigate operational targets prior to a breaching event reduces the possibility for collateral damage to innocent civilians, while simultaneously protecting our men and women in the armed forces from unknown threats. And the development of next-generation Battlefield Management and Command &amp; Control capabilities can allow for increased situational awareness for commanders in the field, augment human senses to provide better warnings and targeting for our soldiers, and help in preventing tragic friendly-fire accidents.<\/p>\n<p id=\"42c9\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We need more investment in technology that confines warfare to combatants and reduces harm to civilian populations and property, not less. At the same time, it is also important to recognize that reduced cost (measured by human lives, natural resources, and\/or financial resources) should not be used as an excuse or rationalization for increased frequency of action.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"35e0\" class=\"nm nn gh be no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj bj\"><strong class=\"al\">The Principles of Just Authority and Right Intent<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p id=\"d4c7\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls ok lu lv lw ol ly lz ma om mc md me on mg mh mi oo mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em class=\"ni\">\u201cAnd thus the commonwealth comes by a power to set down what punishment shall belong to the several transgressions which they think worthy of it, committed amongst the members of that society, (which is the power of making laws) as well as it has the power to punish any injury done unto any of its members, by any one that is not of it, (which is the power of war and peace;) and all this for the preservation of the property of all the members of that society, as far as it is possible.\u201d (Of Civil Government, John Locke)<\/em><\/p>\n<p id=\"d43f\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Once it has been determined that the use of force is merited against an unjust adversary, Just War Theory dictates that a just authority must be invoked prior to engaging in combat.

They have done so by using these technologies as an offensive tool \u2014 through cyber attacks, leaks, and misinformation campaigns \u2014 to harm our interests and those of our allies. They have also used technology defensively \u2014 through censorship, surveillance, and repression \u2014 to reinforce their own power, which can often only thrive inside of information vacuums they have intentionally created. Examples of the use of misinformation and censorship by these regimes includes the Russian denials of incursions into both Ukraine and Georgia, the Great Firewall in China,<a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/El_Paquete_Semanal\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\"> El Paquete Semanal<\/a> in Cuba, truly remarkable<a class=\"af ne\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/allthatsinteresting.com\/north-korean-propaganda-america\&quot;" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\"> anti-US propaganda in North Korea<\/a>, and the long-standing nuclear shell game in Iran, among others.<\/p>\n<p id=\"3e66\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While technology has been used as a powerful tool of repression, it can also be used by the US and its allies to counter information vacuums and establish ground truths in the face of misinformation. Better information makes it more difficult for repressive regimes to operate with impunity, and put the US and its allies in a better position to enforce multi-lateral, diplomatic, and non-military options and avoid unnecessary conflict. Critically, improved information also makes it more likely that US policymakers will make better and more ethical decisions regarding the use of force in any given circumstance.<\/p>\n<p id=\"0f1a\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For example, improved sensor and surveillance technology can make it less likely that we will enter a global conflict based on flawed intelligence. The same goes for technologies permitting effective forensic analysis of captured materials (including documents, photos, videos and hard drives). Similarly, the use of autonomous surveillance platforms, stealth aircraft, and advanced space-based surveillance allows the US and its allies to understand the actual threats posed by autocratic regimes, to minimize false positives\/negatives, and to respond proportionally and effectively when real threats are detected.<\/p>\n<p id=\"3f15\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Further, this emerging \u201cinformation advantage\u201d is forfeited if we don\u2019t simultaneously develop capabilities to make sense of it all. Too often we fail to make use of this data because of old, slow, and ineffective means of analyzing the deluge of new information in order to enable our soldiers and leaders to make life and death decisions with the <em class=\"ni\">right <\/em>information at the right time. This is a critical area of technology development that is deeply shared with the private sector.<\/p>\n<p id=\"31e3\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Surveillance and forensic technologies, like all technologies discussed here, also carry a risk of misuse, particularly when deployed domestically, and their use must be monitored and regulated appropriately. But when used responsibly, they can and will prevent unnecessary conflict and when a military course of action is required, will assist in developing broader support from the international community (a key criteria for Just Authority in the modern era).<\/p>\n<p id=\"983c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While there are significant policy questions relating to the use of AI in battle, Artificial Intelligence can also be deployed in ways that address concerns around Just Authority and Right Intent. A computer\u2019s actions can be monitored and analyzed, its programmed biases corrected, and constraints and limits can be placed on its actions. In the best case, the role of AI in the battlefield will be to implement the terms of engagement set by humans \u2014 who are ultimately accountable for its actions \u2014 while allowing computers to make sure those terms are carried out systematically and precisely and in ways that limit and reduce unnecessary harm.<\/p>\n<p id=\"5696\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">With that said, the principle of Just Authority depends critically on thoughtful policy and open communication around the development and use of defense technology. When democratically-governed people take action against our adversaries, we trust our elected representatives to make truly <em class=\"ni\">representative <\/em>and just decisions. But state sovereignty is <em class=\"ni\">not <\/em>\u201cmorality-free\u201d. It is possible that some legal actions are immoral and that some moral actions are illegal.<\/p>\n<p id=\"8cfe\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Stated less generally, the United States in particular is not beyond reproach, and we should be constantly engaging in a dialogue around how to better ourselves and our institutions. The government we have in place allows for that bettering on a regular basis, locally as well as federally, via election cycles and baseline protections for all citizens. We also have an all-volunteer military who acts according to the guidance of our civilian elected government. These benefits of democratic governance should not be forgotten or taken for granted.<\/p>\n<p id=\"02e5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Notably, the very same technologies that would be used justly towards a better and more humane application of Just War theory could just as easily be used with bad intention and in bad faith stemming from a different ethical framework than what we are accustomed to. It is therefore critical, particularly in Western democratic societies, to lay in place clear policies and practices for the ways in which these technologies can be morally and justly used.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"2fd3\" class=\"nm nn gh be no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj bj\">Conclusion: If you want peace, you must prepare for war<\/h4>\n<p id=\"13c7\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls ok lu lv lw ol ly lz ma om mc md me on mg mh mi oo mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Many in Silicon Valley hold the mistaken belief that if they and their counterparts withdraw from defense or weapons work, they can force a stoppage and bring about a peaceful equilibrium. There is a fundamental consideration that has been too little covered in this debate, however: What are the moral consequences of societies rooted in a Just War tradition refusing to invest in sophisticated defense technologies while authoritarian regimes invest aggressively in their development?<\/p>\n<p id=\"9cc4\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It is common in the modern era to see new military technologies emerge prior to the advent of standards and norms to govern them. This has been the case with nuclear weapons, chemical and biological weapons, satellites and certain types of ballistic missiles. Instead, these standards and norms are reached after the fact, via agreement with the greatest powers who wield the technologies.<\/p>\n<p id=\"1701\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lp lq gh lr b ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm fh bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">History has shown that those who lead in new technologies of defense will set the ethical norms and standards that govern those technologies.

there [sits] <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fourth_Estate\&quot;" rel=\"\">a Fourth Estate<\/a> more important than they all.&#8221; The notion of some vital power beyond our government was imported to the New World, and today constitutes a core belief of the American liberal: there is no free people, we\u2019re often told, without a free press independent of congress, the courts, and our president. But throughout the 20th Century thousands of media outlets gradually consolidated, and by the dawn of our internet era only a few giants remained. These giants largely shared a single perspective, and in rough agreement with the ruling class the Fourth Estate naturally came to serve, rather than critique, power. This relationship metastasized into something very close to authoritarianism during the Covid-19 pandemic, when a single state narrative was written by the press, and ruthlessly enforced by a fifth and final fount of power in the newly-dominant technology industry.<\/p>\n<p>It was a dark alliance of estates, accurate descriptions of which were for years derided as delusional, paranoid, even dangerous. But today, on account of a single shitposting billionaire, the existence of the <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/one-party-state\&quot;" rel=\"\">One Party\u2019s<\/a> decentralized censorship apparatus is now beyond doubt.<\/p>\n<p>A couple weeks back, alleging proof Twitter acted with gross political bias, and in a manner that influenced U.S. elections (!), Elon Musk opened his new company\u2019s internal communications to a small handful of journalists. They set immediately to breaking a series of major stories that have rewritten the history of Trump-era tech. Long story short, Twitter leadership lied to the public, relentlessly, for years, and everything the most paranoid among us ever said about the platform was true. \u201cTrust and safety\u201d is a euphemism for political censorship, with \u201cexpert\u201d teams comprised almost exclusively of the most radical, joyless grievance studies majors you ever met in college. Their goal is to reshape American politics by dominating the bounds of what the public is permitted to consider American politics. In these efforts, they have mostly been succeeding.<\/p>\n<p>On December 2nd, <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/readable-twitter-files\&quot;" rel=\"\">Matt Taibbi shared conversations<\/a> from the company\u2019s \u201ctrust and safety\u201d team that led to Twitter\u2019s suppression of the New York Post\u2019s infamous <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/what-the-hell-is-going-on-at-the\&quot;" rel=\"\">Hunter Biden laptop story<\/a>. While interesting, Taibbi\u2019s most notable revelation came almost as a side: both major political parties, as well as the White House, maintained direct lines of communication with Twitter, which they used to formally request content be removed from the platform. The company responded enthusiastically to many of these requests, and the examples we have (for now) come from the Democratic Party. Critics have been quick to point out Trump was in the White House at the time, though less interested, for some reason, in what \u2014\u00a0if anything \u2014\u00a0he removed from the site.<\/p>\n<p>On December 6th, Bari Weiss and her colleagues reported out proof of <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/readable-twitter-files-part-2\&quot;" rel=\"\">Twitter\u2019s secret blacklists<\/a>, in which both specific topics and, more problematically, people were de-amplified by the \u201ctrust and safety\u201d team. The blacklisting was done for a nebulous host of reasons that generally amounted to something like \u2018this feels dangerous.\u2019 Danger was, of course, defined by partisan operatives, and exclusively targeted right-coded positions. Skepticism of radical gender ideology, distrust of public Covid policy, and almost anything having to do with the integrity of our last election were at the top of the list.<\/p>\n<p>Separate from any opinion concerning whether such topics, or the purveyors of such topics, should have been \u201cshadow banned,\u201d the revelation that they were is immensely important on account of Twitter\u2019s censors, with their many supporters in the press, have denied the existence of these tools for years.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, over the last few days, <a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/mtaibbi\/status\/1601352083617505281%3Fs=20&amp;t=7DweviJxU-Do_iWeIlXAHg\&quot;.html" rel=\"\">Taibbi<\/a>, <a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShellenbergerMD\/status\/1601720455005511680%3Fs=20&amp;t=7DweviJxU-Do_iWeIlXAHg\&quot;.html" rel=\"\">Michael Shellenberger<\/a>, and <a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/bariweiss\/status\/1602364197194432515%3Fs=20&amp;t=7DweviJxU-Do_iWeIlXAHg\&quot;.html" rel=\"\">Bari<\/a> have all reported out pieces of Donald Trump\u2019s deplatforming, which is easily the most famous digital unpersoning in history. It is also the least compelling story in the series. While it\u2019s good to finally know exactly what happened, it really just was what everyone assumed: Trump was not banned for violating policy. Trump was banned because Twitter employees, who donated literally 99% of their political contributions <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/nypost.com\/2021\/12\/04\/data-shows-twitter-employees-donate-more-to-democrats-by-wide-margin\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">to the Democratic Party<\/a>, demanded it be done regardless of their own rules.<\/p>\n<p>Altogether, the Twitter Files \u2014\u00a0an ongoing story \u2014 paint a portrait of clear and inevitable partisan bias at one of the most dominant speech platforms in history. A small handful of very left-wing executives, who naturally perceived most opinion right of center as dangerous, worked tirelessly to limit those opinions from view. Empowered to censor \u201cunsafe\u201d content, and protected by a team of people who shared their political orientation, the executives produced, in a legal and decentralized manner, a key component of our defacto state censorship apparatus. While we don\u2019t know for sure this is also happening at Google, Meta, or TikTok (which is for some reason still allowed to operate in this country), I think it\u2019s a safe bet we\u2019re looking at an industry-wide affliction.<\/p>\n<p>But I do have questions.<\/p>\n<p>Where is the full list of shadow-banned accounts? Which political campaigns, specifically, communicated with Twitter, and what specifically was taken down? What about requests from foreign governments? What about requests from our own government? We need to know which of our government agencies, if any, had content removed from the platform, and we need to know the nature of this content. Taibbi alluded to Trump\u2019s White House \u2014\u00a0did someone from the Trump administration request a takedown? Who made the request? Who received the request? Was it answered? What, if anything, was removed?<\/p>\n<p>The Trump line of questioning is, in particular, something you might assume attractive to the media, which has waged all-out war on the populist clown king for the last seven years. Alas, the press seems broadly disinterested. Is this because they don\u2019t believe the former president ever made such requests, or is their lack of interest rather stemming from a fear of validating a major story most of them are currently trying to frame \u2014\u00a0for their own obvious political reasons \u2014\u00a0as not worth reading?<\/p>\n<p>A brief selection of positions from our cherished Fourth Estate: This entire story is a \u201cdud\u201d (<a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2022\/12\/03\/elon-musk-twitter-files\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">The Washington Post<\/a>) \u2014\u00a0no bombshells here!

The Twitter Files, in which a handful of committed partisans enthusiastically censor large swaths of the conservative base, including a former president, actually prove the company was <em>not<\/em>politically biased. It is, however, now biased against Democrats (<a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/nymag.com\/intelligencer\/2022\/12\/twitter-files-explained-elon-musk-taibbi-weiss-hunter-biden-laptop.html\&quot;" rel=\"\">New York Magazine<\/a>). Elon\u2019s expos\u00e9 is a flop that doesn\u2019t matter. It has also placed multiple \u201ctrust and safety experts\u201d in mortal danger (<a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/12\/2\/23490863\/elon-musk-twitter-expose-hunter-biden-flop-doxxed-multiple-people\&quot;" rel=\"\">The Verge<\/a>, predictably). Then, my favorite: it is good to finally see the blacklist tools I have been curious about for many years, which we have by the way always known existed, and therefore don\u2019t matter (<a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2022\/12\/elon-musk-twitter-files-documents-bari-weiss\/672421\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">The Atlantic<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The charge of shadow banning evoked uniquely loud jeering from the press, including Charlie Warzel in particular, a man formerly of the position \u201cTwitter <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/charliewarzel\/twitter-shadow-ban-republicans-bug\&quot;" rel=\"\">isn\u2019t shadow banning<\/a> Republicans.\u201d Now, in the face of evidence the company absolutely shadow banned Republicans, the official position is we are using the term \u201cshadow ban\u201d <a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/cwarzel\/status\/1601038454930145281%3Fs=20&amp;t=b0DeU1t2AXG8WRrFIf4PNA].\&quot;.html" rel=\"\">incorrectly<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a game of semantics, in which the public is dragged through the exhausting, useless question of how much invisible speech suppression, precisely, constitutes a \u201creal\u201d shadow ban, rather than the glaringly important questions of both ethics and, frankly, safety. In the first place,\u00a0is it right to run a decentralized censorship apparatus, and to make your rules invisible? In the second, what happens to a free country when the bounds of acceptable speech are set by a small cabal of unelected partisan cops? Because my sense is the answer isn\u2019t \u201cfreedom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There have been a few notable, if cautiously dissenting opinions from prominent voices in media. Buzzfeed\u2019s <a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/katienotopoulos\/status\/1598868918310825985%3Fs=20&amp;t=dvJi6r4aX-fOKPr1i0o7XQ\&quot;.html" rel=\"\">Katie Notopoulos<\/a>, the Los Angeles Times\u2019 <a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeffbercovici\/status\/1601370761687539712%3Fs=20&amp;t=dvJi6r4aX-fOKPr1i0o7XQ\&quot;.html" rel=\"\">Jeff Bercovici<\/a>, and the New York Times\u2019 <a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/MikeIsaac\/status\/1601371363599523840%3Fs=20&amp;t=dvJi6r4aX-fOKPr1i0o7XQ\&quot;.html" rel=\"\">Mike Isaac<\/a> all took somewhat risky positions in favor of transparency, apparently no longer in vogue among journalists, with Jeff explicitly acknowledging the important nature of the revelations. But I\u2019ve only seen one actual piece, drafted and published by a reasonably mainstream media entity, embrace any aspect of the Twitter Files.<\/p>\n<p>Anthony Fisher, an opinion editor at the Daily Beast, <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/heres-what-outrages-me-more-than-twitters-censorship-of-the-hunter-biden-laptop-story\&quot;" rel=\"\">danced around the subject<\/a>, and awkwardly tried to obscure his overall agreement the story mattered behind many paragraphs demonstrating his conservative-hating bonafides. But in addressing Twitter\u2019s censorship he did include the following important line:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>And that lesson is \u201cDon\u2019t trust (or demand) billionaire tech bros to be the arbiters of truth and news.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It was a flashback to the position most journalists and activists shared in the days before Donald Trump. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t long before they realized they had a political ally in tech industry hall monitors, and set about a national power grab. In any case, if you were to strip the above position from all its obnoxious tribal language, it would really just be: no few people should control the bounds of acceptable discourse. I agree. But narrowly focused on the \u201ctech bro,\u201d the point not only betrays a bias, but misses a defining aspect of technology.<\/p>\n<p>The Fifth Estate is a fundamentally different kind of power. It\u2019s more difficult to consolidate than media, and more difficult to control than even our government divided by design. Its impact is also far more difficult to predict. This is because technology is above all things defined in terms of newness, which not only makes it disruptive of pre-existing power, but destructive of itself \u2014\u00a0a sort of anti-power that only guarantees change. The true failsafe. Our ultimate reset. Tremendously empowering of tyranny in times of stagnation, technology is also our most powerful weapon against tyranny in times of innovation.<\/p>\n<p>While many tech giants have gone the way of media in consolidating power, centralizing, and aligning with the state, the future of technology is always change. From encrypted chats and blockchain to artificially intelligent search, every tech giant that amassed power over the last two decades will be facing existential threats in the years to come \u2014\u00a0not only from the government, but from the industry.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of Twitter, Elon is already leveraging Fifth Estate properties, and not by employing current tools to amplify his own opinions (an emerging conspiracy). He is iterating product more rapidly than we\u2019ve seen from any major, consumer-facing tech company in years. The trial and error here has largely been ridiculed by people who have never built a technology company. But while detractors are obsessed with his censorship abilities, Elon\u2019s platform experiments are the things actually capable of root-changing the national discourse. The medium is the message, and the medium is evolving. Whatever works on Twitter will be cloned. The bounds of acceptable discourse will change, and none of this will have anything to do with Elon\u2019s spicy tweets.<\/p>\n<p>But about those spicy tweets \u2014<\/p>\n<p>As the former lords of Twitter descend into hysterics with outlandish comments declaring Elon a Nazi, or a proponent of the QAnon conspiracy, or whatever other bit of unhinged loser bullshit, he faces two significant threats. First, he\u2019s clearly made an enemy of every other major fount of power, including in particular the Fourth Estate. This will impact all of Elon\u2019s companies, as they all require support from the government and public, and the opinions of our government and public are still shaped, to a large extent, by the media. It\u2019s no coincidence most powerful tech executives, from Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos to Jack Dorsey, share a carefully-crafted language of neutrality. This air of neutrality is how a king behaves, because the air of neutrality is how a king survives. In flaunting his power, rather than obscuring it, Elon is asking to be attacked, and his enemies are happy to oblige, even while more dominant platforms go unbothered.<\/p>\n<p>Something like 80 million Americans are using TikTok, a company hopelessly compromised by the Chinese Communist Party.

What the Twitter Files prove beyond doubt is censorship in the age of social media is power \u2014\u00a0a real and dangerous power that corrupts.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Dorsey <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/jack-be-nimble-jack-be-quick\&quot;" rel=\"\">appeared before Congress<\/a>, and declared neither he nor anyone else, and certainly not anyone in government, should be allowed to set the bounds of acceptable speech for the entire country. But with no viable alternative, someone does need to bear the ring. In leaked texts from the recent Twitter legal saga, it\u2019s clear Jack believed Elon a worthy steward of this tremendous power, and, for what it\u2019s worth, I agree. But provided the nation remains free, the rules of the Fifth Estate are immutable. Power comes in dramatic upward swings, and resets the status quo. It will not \u2014\u00a0it can not \u2014\u00a0last forever. So change the world, but be mindful of temptation, and make good use of your god mode powers while you have them.

When SaaS spend grew 50% per year, it was hard <em>not<\/em> to find green pastures as a new software startup. And consumers doubling their Internet spend and smartphone usage simultaneously every couple of years opened a massive window for new mobile applications.<\/p>\n<p>The current exponential growth in VC fundraises, startup projections, and valuations for the past two decades all assume these tailwinds will continue in the 2020s.

This usage will undoubtedly continue to grow: e-commerce will continue taking over physical retail, and SaaS spend will continue replacing manual business processes.<\/p>\n<p>But people can\u2019t spend more than 100% of their time or money on the Internet. As we approach full online penetration, new companies will need to steal revenue and users from Internet incumbents to grow.<\/p>\n<p>Like any mature industry, Silicon Valley must battle to maintain growth in the face of immense economic gravity. For the first time in Internet history, startup growth will require a push from the company and not a pull from the market. Unlike the organic pull that drove many of the dotcom-era successes, today\u2019s Internet startups need to fight for growth by investing more heavily into sales, marketing, and operations.<\/p>\n<p>Tapering tailwinds mean that incremental spend will slow. This empowers Internet incumbents to capture the remaining incremental spend with their existing product and go-to-market organizations, leaving Internet startups with fewer shots on goal to capture spend:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2030 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1312\" height=\"812\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-2.jpeg 1312w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-2-300x186.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-2-1024x634.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-2-768x475.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1312px) 100vw, 1312px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What are the practical consequences of the Internet\u2019s shift towards maturation? We can look through financial and cultural lenses to better understand the implications. We\u2019ll see an acceleration of zero-sum games between Internet startups and incumbents. A shift from R&amp;D to SG&amp;A will operationalize Silicon Valley, leaving room for new financial infrastructure. VCs will need to take risks on vision, not numbers. And the founders and operators of tomorrow won\u2019t look like those of the past 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Competition: an acceleration of zero-sum games<\/h4>\n<p>We are building an exponential number of Internet companies that compete over ever-shrinking slices of consumer attention and enterprise spend, increasingly locked down by incumbents.<\/p>\n<p>We can look beyond tech to guess what will happen.<\/p>\n<p>How does a company like Boeing continue to grow its commercial airplane business? Sure, there\u2019s nominal annual growth in demand for airplanes, but the primary growth vectors are zero sum: stealing market share from Airbus, or acquiring smaller manufacturers. This will increasingly happen between Internet companies.<\/p>\n<p>Software companies founded today are competing less with pen and paper than with other Internet-first incumbents. Put another way, as happens in every maturing industry before it, Internet company revenue will become zero-sum. As a corollary, the time between founding years of software startups and their competitive incumbents is shrinking:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2031 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1452\" height=\"886\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-3.jpeg 1452w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-3-300x183.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-3-1024x625.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Chart-3-768x469.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1452px) 100vw, 1452px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When there are massive economies of scale \u2013 a marketplace or a social network, for example \u2013 the <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Blitzscaling-Lightning-Fast-Building-Massively-Companies\/dp\/1524761419\&quot;" rel=\"\">blitzscaling<\/a> approach works well. The first to critical mass wins.<\/p>\n<p>Does this strategy still work today?<\/p>\n<p>Scale advantages still exist at the corporate level: brand accumulation, supplier purchasing power, and cheaper access to capital. But today, true network effects-driven business models are rarer than ever. Simultaneously, there are diseconomies of scale in the tech ecosystem: fiercer competition for talent, <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.zillow.com\/san-francisco-ca\/home-values\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">skyrocketing real estate prices<\/a>, and sophisticated incumbents driving up customer acquisition costs.<\/p>\n<p>The blitzscaling playbook is more fitting as a reflection on the past two decades than as a prescription for the 2020s. When the ecosystem-level diseconomies rival the company-level economies of scale \u2013 \u201cfirst to scale\u201d may become \u201cfirst to fail\u201d. Unit economics matter more than ever. Carefully measured growth will win.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Hiring: a shift from R&amp;D to SG&amp;A<\/h4>\n<p>Internet startups will face new tactical realities as a result of zero-sum competition. As we experience <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.bondcap.com\/report\/itr19\/#view\/25\"" rel=\"\">CAC inflation<\/a> across industries due to more people bidding on static ad inventory, Internet startups need to invest more into SG&amp;A than ever to maintain growth.<\/p>\n<p>To run a thought exercise: what would happen if you needed to reduce your startup\u2019s operating expenses by 50%? Many startups are running this unfortunate thought exercise right now.<\/p>\n<p>If Google were to fire half of its employees, there would be large reorgs and engineers would be stretched thin, but the financial outlook would be fine. Its core business \u2013 search (supply) and ads (demand) \u2013 is an autonomous machine with limited human capital requirements. I would expect a diminutive decline in revenue, and even a large increase in net income.<\/p>\n<p>As an enterprise software company, on the other hand, your growth would slow as you fire AEs, and churn would increase as you shrink your customer success team.<\/p>\n<p>As an atoms-heavy marketplace, your local operations and customer support teams would fall apart, and supply acquisition would stall out.<\/p>\n<p>Internet companies have spent the last 20 years capturing opportunities with the highest margins, lowest operational complexity, and strongest market pull: search, social networks, CRMs, ecommerce.<\/p>\n<p>As the Internet growth tailwinds subside, what\u2019s left? Harder problems. Today, startups tend to focus on problem spaces where there is higher operational and go-to-market complexity. This could mean companies with an atoms component, or with a tougher sales process, perhaps stemming from a weaker market need or more robust competition. This often means higher marginal costs to sell and provide services. More software sales reps chasing the same customers, and more ad dollars chasing the same clicks, means more expensive customer acquisition \u2013 it\u2019s a simple matter of supply and demand. This translates into higher investments into SG&amp;A, and eventually lower gross margins.<\/p>\n<p>To pose the inverse of the opex reduction question: if you had an extra million dollars for your startup, where would you spend it?<\/p>\n<p>In the immature Internet era, a consumer Internet company would likely invest this money into R&amp;D by hiring engineers, product managers, or designers. Consumer Internet companies famously grew without needing employees \u2013 Instagram grew to 30 million users with 13 employees in 15 months, and Whatsapp had 500 million users with 50 employees just 5 years after founding. They hired people to support their growing user base after achieving scale.<\/p>\n<p>The dominant startups today tell a different story. As a marketplace with a physical component \u2013 say, food delivery or ridesharing \u2013 you might spend this money on local ops and supply acquisition. As a SaaS company, you\u2019d spend an extra million to hire more sales reps or run a marketing campaign. These SG&amp;A investments are a prerequisite to drive business growth. Relative to the R&amp;D-driven growth of early Internet companies, SG&amp;A will become the primary growth vector in the 2020s.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Growth: higher SG&amp;A spend means more predictable growth<\/h4>\n<p>There is a silver lining: as Internet companies invest more into SG&amp;A, they\u2019ll have a clearer understanding of their growth levers.<\/p>\n<p>As a founder, there\u2019s an important question of which employees are critical to growing the core business.<\/p>\n<p>During the consumer Internet era, an investment into R&amp;D helped move the product forward, but not typically in a financially quantifiable way. The ROI on the marginal hire was positive, but relatively uncertain: you wouldn\u2019t hire an engineer for $80k per year expecting them to generate six figures of enterprise value annually, but they would develop features to retain and grow your user base.<\/p>\n<p>Investing in R&amp;D was king for the early Internet era, but it has diminishing marginal returns \u2013 everyone has read cautionary tales around technical debt and engineering coordination problems. At scale, many consumer Internet companies <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/youtu.be\/2Q26XIKtwXQ?t=36\&quot;" rel=\"\">prefer holding cash<\/a> to reinvesting into R&amp;D.<\/p>\n<p><a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/paulg\/status\/1161483728574722053\&quot;" rel=\"\">Paul Graham tweeted<\/a> that \u201ca visitor who walks around and is impressed by the magnitude of your operation is implicitly saying \u201cDid it really take all these people to make that crappy product?\u201d\u201d But this observation is fixated on a world where R&amp;D dominated Internet startup headcount, and small teams were preferable.<\/p>\n<p>For SG&amp;A-heavy companies that dominate today\u2019s startup ecosystem, headcount is now more causal than resultative of growth. While consumer internet companies scaled up opex after scaling user growth, labor-driven marketplaces and enterprise software companies require heavy SG&amp;A investments to drive growth:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consumer Internet<\/strong>: <em>user growth \u2192 fundraise \u2192 invest into R&amp;D<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Labor-driven marketplaces<\/strong>:<em> fundraise \u2192 invest into SG&amp;A \u2192 user growth<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>Enterprise software<\/strong>: <em>fundraise \u2192 invest into SG&amp;A \u2192 user growth<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This causal relationship may seem counterintuitive, given there\u2019s more tooling than ever making it easier to start a company. Shouldn\u2019t we soon have a one-employee unicorn? But this deflationary pressure on startup capex is offset by the inflation in opex: labor, operational, and distribution costs. As startup success becomes zero-sum, growth will be more expensive \u2013\u00a0both in terms of financial and human capital.<\/p>\n<p>In the past five years, startup spend ROI has become more predictable as it shifts from R&amp;D to SG&amp;A: in contrast to an engineer, a salesperson or operations leader can drive a quantifiable amount of value to your top line (growing revenue) or bottom line (increasing LTV). But as with most investments with predictable yields, it will commoditize \u2013 companies will grow spend as fast as possible while generating acceptable yields. Like any low-yield business, companies will need to compensate for these yields in volume \u2013 investing more dollars to generate the same cash flows.<\/p>\n<p>This creates an increasing need for software to operationalize growth. As growth becomes the key bottleneck of Silicon Valley Internet companies, software that measures and unlocks growth will become correspondingly desirable. This may take the form of cross-functional growth software \u2013 an orchestration layer between sales, marketing, finance, and operations \u2013 quantifying ROI tradeoffs across divisions to help founders make strategic decisions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Financial operationalization: Sand Hill Sachs<\/h4>\n<p>As a prospective founder, don\u2019t be scared off by the increasingly zero-sum nature of Silicon Valley. This dynamic presents an opportunity to build the financial layer of tech, similar to what Goldman Sachs did for the rest of corporate America.<\/p>\n<p>What is Goldman Sachs? Goldman is a financial layer on top of corporate America, helping to fuel its growth. They offer services ranging from M&amp;A advice, IPO underwriting, private equity, debt investing, prime brokerage, private wealth management, market making, and investment research.<\/p>\n<p>As the ROI of SG&amp;A spend becomes more predictable, a non-VC financial layer will emerge within Silicon Valley, similarly helping to fuel its growth. This capital layer can help partially compensate for the slowing market-based growth tailwinds. This suite of services will benefit from a tech-specific approach: real-time debt offerings based on operating KPIs, securitization of software ARR, and retail investor-facing SaaS bonds.<\/p>\n<p>Today, many startups interface with banks only as they near IPO. In the 2020s, tech advisory services will emerge to help growth-stage startups achieve their financial goals \u2013 divorcing companies\u2019 financial strategies from their operational strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Why can\u2019t a traditional bank do this themselves? 1) They don\u2019t understand how to underwrite using tech industry metrics (ACVs, churn, LTV, engagement, et al.), and 2) they don\u2019t have the tech DNA to underwrite programmatically, which Sand Hill Sachs will have. This may be a new company, an existing fintech player with distribution in tech, a VC firm, or a bank. My bet would be on a new startup or a late-stage fintech company.<\/p>\n<p>As Alex Danco highlighted in his recent article <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/alexdanco.com\/2020\/02\/07\/debt-is-coming\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">Debt is Coming<\/a>, it is clear that recurring revenue securitization \u2013\u00a0the notion of selling your future ARR bookings at a discount \u2013\u00a0is the future. The biggest barrier to adoption is cultural: the stigma that <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/paulg\/status\/1225764602086076416\&quot;" rel=\"\">\u201cventure debt is like a delicious sandwich that only costs ten cents, but occasionally explodes in your face\u201d<\/a> is deeply tied to the predatory reputation of old-school venture debt lenders. Companies like Pipe and Clearbanc are already starting to destigmatize securitization, and it will only become more culturally normalized in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>Once this securitization accelerates, ARR securities will become the next bond-like asset class for both institutions and individuals \u2013\u00a0irresponsible <em>not<\/em> to have some in your portfolio, as a fixed income product and a balance against equities. And who will make this market? Sand Hill Sachs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">VCs: take risk on vision, not on numbers<\/h4>\n<div id=\"\u00a7vcs-take-risk-on-vision-not-on-numbers\" class=\"header-anchor-widget offset-top\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button-container\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Once Sand Hill Sachs exists, it will become clear that VC dollars should be reserved for R&amp;D, not S&amp;M or G&amp;A.<\/p>\n<p>A large portion of the collective effort of VCs is focused on late-stage software financings. This certainly will not go away, but companies with predictable metrics will have access to alternative financing options like debt and securitization products. VCs will increasingly need to distinguish between S&amp;M, G&amp;A, and R&amp;D risk.<\/p>\n<p>As a VC, the question becomes: how can you generate alpha through the financial commoditization of Silicon Valley? Thankfully for my industry, there are several risks VCs will continue to be uniquely good at taking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R&amp;D risk<\/strong> \u2013 can this technology be built?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Founder risk<\/strong> \u2013 can this team build it?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vision risk<\/strong> \u2013 can this idea become huge?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Macro risk<\/strong> \u2013 will this startup win in 2030\u2019s political, economic, and competitive climate?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>VCs will be rewarded for investing in companies with limited empirical data or historical precedent \u2013\u00a0which, after all, is the foundational idea behind venture capital. Idiosyncratic companies with limited tech precedent will be relatively immune to this shift (defense or health insurance, e.g.), as will those with limited empirical data (e.g. biotech or pre-launch products).<\/p>\n<p>When late-stage investing shifts away from primary capital-based fundraising, secondary investments will become important to generate VC returns for growth investors. Carta and Forge are uniquely well-positioned for this shift as market makers, as are funds registered as RIAs to capitalize on secondary opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Late-stage VCs often lament that other funds are willing to underwrite to a lower multiple \u2013 and thus give higher valuations to companies. If the growth-stage multiple expectations continue to decline, it will only accelerate the relative attractiveness of late-stage debt, both for founders (no dilution) and investors (guaranteed IRR).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Founders: a new playbook<\/h4>\n<p>In the late 1990s, the prototypical startup founding team was two engineers working out of a garage, seared into our brains by the successes of garage startups like HP, Apple, and Amazon. This formula worked because you needed computer nerds to reimagine industries for the online world, as far away from industry experts as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the Internet blueprint has been laid. If new Internet startups are increasingly competing with Internet-first incumbents, what would a promising Internet startup founder look like today? There will certainly always be value in fresh perspectives from industry outsiders. But on a relative basis, founders with 1) experience in growing online businesses, or 2) pre-existing distribution advantages will have a premium that didn\u2019t exist before.<\/p>\n<p>For startups taking R&amp;D risk in new technological areas, the founding team may look like something we can\u2019t pattern match to historical successes. Maybe it\u2019s a scientist in his garage who escaped the tendrils of academia. Or your first hire for the founding team is no longer your college roommate, but an expert in your startup\u2019s industry.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Career paths &amp; education: will finance sneak into STEM?<\/h4>\n<p>In the 1990s and 2000s, computer science was the dominant major by almost any metric: financial success, career impact, social capital. Eric Schmidt, Meg Whitman, Marc Andreessen, Marissa Mayer, Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 all STEM majors.<\/p>\n<p>In a maturing Silicon Valley, what career paths will be rewarded?<\/p>\n<p>We may see a reacceleration in fields like biology or mechanical engineering as we build platforms beyond the Internet.<\/p>\n<p>In the Internet context, as growth is in short supply, the labor market seems to be providing. We are already seeing growth sneak into job titles: growth engineers, growth teams, growth marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps ahead of the curve, many of the CS majors at Stanford no longer want to be engineers. Being a product manager or chief of staff is the new post-college status symbol. I think there is an organizational component to this: as there\u2019s a shift towards SG&amp;A spend in Silicon Valley, there\u2019s an increased premium on cross-functional roles (or conversely, a lower premium on pure R&amp;D roles).<\/p>\n<p>A rise in the importance of S&amp;M roles may lead to a revival of econ and statistics in undergrad. Since 2008, there has been a <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/registrar.stanford.edu\/everyone\/degrees-conferred\/degrees-conferred-2018-19\&quot;" rel=\"\">nearly 50% decline<\/a> in Stanford economics graduates \u2013 which you can think of as a \u201cpre-finance\u201d degree \u2013 largely driven by a declining appeal of investment banking, and an increasing appeal of computer science. As Silicon Valley builds out its financial infrastructure to maintain growth, will we see a \u201cCS + finance\u201d hybrid major appear?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>The Internet\u2019s maturation will have ripple effects across every financial and cultural aspect of the technology industry. There certainly will be $10 billion dollar companies started within segments slow to adopt technology: legal tech, construction, agriculture, and mining are all prime candidates for massive new technology entrants. But new $100 billion dollar outcomes are less likely to come from pure Internet companies.<\/p>\n<p>The Silicon Valley of tomorrow will not look like that of today \u2013\u00a0success stories rarely repeat themselves \u2013 but new Internet opportunities certainly aren\u2019t going away. Quite the opposite: recognizing where we are in the Internet adoption curve clarifies the opportunities in front of us. Founders may seize this moment to build new tools to better understand operational investments, create the financial layer of the Internet, or look beyond the Internet to build new platforms in biotech or energy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Internet tailwinds that propelled Silicon Valley\u2019s meteoric growth for decades are stalling out.

A half century later, NASA embarked on a quest to put a man on the moon. Combustion, penicillin, nuclear fission; the discovery of America, the drafting of the Constitution, Normandy \u2014\u00a0history is defined by protagonists pursuing <em>good quests<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s your quest?<\/p>\n<p>Quests tend to manifest as an objective we center our lives around. Your quest might be to reach a specific milestone: to become a senator, to publish a book, to make a million dollars. But not all quests have an end state. You might be on a quest to maximize your net worth, or to bench-press more weight than anyone else at the gym. Maybe you\u2019re just on a quest to have the most fun possible before you die. A far cry from refrigeration or running water, but a nice life. As you\u2019ve probably already intuited, not all quests are created equal.<\/p>\n<p>In the most simple terms possible: a <em>good<\/em> quest makes the future better than our world today, while a <em>bad<\/em> quest doesn&#8217;t improve the world much at all, or even makes it worse.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we are in a crisis. Silicon Valley&#8217;s best \u2014 our top operators, exited founders, and most powerful investors \u2014 are almost all on <em>bad quests. <\/em>Exiting your first startup only to enter venture capital and fight your peers for allocation in a hot deal is a bad quest. Armchair philosophizing on Twitter is a bad quest. Yachting between emails in de facto retirement at age 35 is a very bad quest.<\/p>\n<p>Even among the talented who choose a path of building, most take safe, incremental bets \u2014\u00a0another SaaS company, another turnkey consumer startup, another digital Beanie Baby. Such pursuits not only fail to push the world forward, but pose a cost in opportunity. There are important challenges facing humanity that no one is working on, including critical, and even existential challenges. In other words, if you are an exceptionally capable person, failure to pursue a good quest is not neutral. It constitutes a loss for humanity.<\/p>\n<p>Among our very best, dropping out, or chasing nonsense, is actually unethical.<\/p>\n<h4>Most Good Quests are Hard<\/h4>\n<p>Quests vary in difficulty.<\/p>\n<p>A <em>hard <\/em>quest is high-risk and operationally complex, with a low chance of success. Reversing aging, going to Mars, curing cancer, building a supersonic plane, creating AGI, or founding a new country \u2014 these are all <em>hard<\/em> quests, and most players attempting these quests will fail.<\/p>\n<p>An easy quest is typically more straightforward, with a well-understood playbook for success. Achieving top marks in your high school class is an easy quest. Losing or gaining weight in accordance with some modest personal fitness goal is, for most people, an easy quest.<\/p>\n<p>There are certainly <em>bad<\/em> quests that are <em>hard<\/em>, and (a few) good quests that are easy. But most of the remaining good quests are difficult to make profitable, require heavy research and development spend, or are just incredibly technically challenging, to the point of near impossibility.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2045 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Full.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2760\" height=\"2320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Full.png 2760w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Full-300x252.png 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Full-1024x861.png 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Full-768x646.png 768w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Full-1536x1291.png 1536w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Full-2048x1722.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2760px) 100vw, 2760px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Log scale.

These attributes influence the likelihood of you succeeding on your <em>quest<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are a recent engineering graduate, you might have some computer science skills, and a lot of energy. On the other hand, if you are an older repeat founder, you might have less energy, and more familial commitments, but a large network of potential employees, management experience, and enough social capital to raise a large amount of money for an unproven idea.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2047 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Square-Founders.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2760\" height=\"1942\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Square-Founders.png 2760w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Square-Founders-300x211.png 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Square-Founders-1024x721.png 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Square-Founders-768x540.png 768w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Square-Founders-1536x1081.png 1536w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/AON-Body-Image-Square-Founders-2048x1441.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2760px) 100vw, 2760px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A player&#8217;s ability to complete their quest is a function of the quest and their own skills, resources, and powers. Quests that are easy for certain players are nearly impossible for others: Olympic runners will regularly run sub-5 minute miles during training, even though this would be an incredibly ambitious goal for most people.<\/p>\n<p>The impact of a player&#8217;s abilities particularly matters with hard quests, where the likelihood of success is already slim. If someone with no background in nuclear physics, no money, and no network chooses not to work on nuclear fusion it doesn\u2019t really matter. In fact, their chances of success were so low that pursuing such a goal would have actually been bad \u2014\u00a0an opportunity cost, where they could have worked on a more natural fit that would have enriched their lives and the lives of those around them. But if a talented nuclear physicist with compelling insights into the field, ample resources, and many well-connected peers decides to open a tiki bar in Bali that is an extraordinarily bad quest.<\/p>\n<h4>The Allure of Bad Quests<\/h4>\n<p>A few common traps lead our most skilled, resourced players to select <em>bad quests <\/em>after achieving their first big success.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most dangerous traps: in Silicon Valley, many top players are lured by the prospect of becoming an investor, either by joining an existing venture capital firm, or by starting their own fund.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1980s, a venture capitalist could truthfully say their investment was the difference between life or death for an important, generational technology company. Funding such companies, in this way, was absolutely a good quest. But today there are more people &#8220;helping the builders&#8221; than actually building, fighting one another in a zero-sum game for allocation in competitive deals. Incredibly, being an investor has become one of the highest status jobs in Silicon Valley \u2014\u00a0higher even than playing an important operating role at a great company. This has led to an overproduction of venture capitalists without enough companies to fund.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond investing, many former founders leverage their success to become public pseudo-intellectuals, speaking on podcasts and broadcasting their thoughts on popular tech Twitter accounts. But unless you are a truly generational thinker, proselytizing is far less impactful than building a specific, better version of the future. To the public intellectual, one must ask: if your ideas are so good, why aren&#8217;t you executing on them? It is much easier (and less impactful) to write about the importance of \u201cgreen tech\u201d than to build Tesla. Moreover, many self-titled public intellectuals are not even particularly intellectual. They are just\u2026 public.<\/p>\n<p>And for the rare successful operators who do go on to start a new company, most opt to copy a successful product and compete for market share. Today, the market is overrun with luxury credit cards and task management tools. While often lucrative, these are also generally <em>bad quests<\/em>. While the players may profit from winning market share from existing companies, they&#8217;ve allocated talent (including their own) and resources away from hard, important problems.<\/p>\n<h4><em>Case Study: The Bad Quests of the Facebook Mafia\u00a0<\/em><\/h4>\n<p>We could choose from any number of tech success stories as our case study in bad quest selection. But perhaps the best example of an alumni-network \u201crandom-bad-quest-generator\u201d is Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, Facebook had one of the highest-profile IPOs in history. Overnight, dozens of its executives became simultaneously wealthy and famous. The question of the day was what they would do with all of their newfound social capital and leverage. Would this be a sequel to the Valley\u2019s legendary PayPal Mafia, in which the founding team of a paradigm-altering technology company continued on to found and fund an entire generation of paradigm-altering technology companies?<\/p>\n<p>It would not.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the rare and precious opportunity to embark on ambitious second acts, almost everyone in the Facebook Mafia played it safe. Most alums started venture capital funds (i.e. Slow Ventures), or worked as GPs at existing funds (Kleiner Perkins, or General Catalyst). Alums who started new companies nearly all built derivative software products. Such quests would never be remembered. Today, even the name \u201cFacebook Mafia,\u201d once in vogue for all of its potential, has nearly been forgotten.<\/p>\n<h4>The Moral Imperative<\/h4>\n<p>History is the record of<em> top players<\/em> completing <em>good<\/em> <em>quests<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The vast majority of quests, even during times of great progress, constitute what functionally amount to economic noise. At the same time the Wright brothers were experimenting with flight, a sea of successful financiers filed paperwork that shuffled numbers on the global spreadsheet. Such men worked hard \u2014\u00a0maybe \u2014 and still their efforts were forgotten. But from planes and power plants to medicine and light, the achievements of those men and women who embarked on good quests built the modern world.<\/p>\n<p>For our best players with exceptional fundraising and hiring superpowers,<em> hard quests<\/em>are difficult. But for everyone else, they are nearly impossible. Therefore, <em>there is a moral imperative for our best players to choose good, hard quests.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>The Good News<\/h4>\n<p>Despite many examples to the contrary, there are still successful players who are using their position to embark on good quests. The quintessential example of successful founders using their social capital for good are the billionaire space cowboys \u2014\u00a0Musk, Branson, and Bezos.<\/p>\n<p>Less discussed examples include Sam Altman taking over OpenAI, where he and his team have delivered mind-bending AI products like GPT-3 and DALL-E, after serving as the President of YCombinator. Palmer Luckey used his earnings from selling Oculus to Facebook to launch Anduril, a new-age defense prime building innovative technology for national security. After Peter Reinhardt exited from Segment, his (admittedly somewhat boring) enterprise software company, he founded Charm Industrial, a complex carbon removal tech company. Jeff Kaditz left his fintech startup Affirm in 2015 to start the full-body scanning company Q Bio.<\/p>\n<p>Almost all of these founders have deep personal motivations to keep building, even while they have no financial incentive to do so. Throwing yourself into another decade-long project of frenetic building can\u2019t just be about making more money, especially when you already have more money than you can spend in a single lifetime. Some find motivation in revenge, others in a \u201chigher calling,\u201d and still others in a compulsive need to build. Innovation is a business for the imbalanced and troubled more than silver-tongued politicians and gala-attending thinkfluencers.<\/p>\n<p>As a culture, we have a tendency to celebrate status that emerges from net worth and network signaling rather than the work ethic of a second-act founder using his net worth and network, while he grinds on a project, to drive the world forward. This is totally backwards.<\/p>\n<p>The world is filled with good quests that require massively leveled heroes to complete:\u00a0 semiconductor manufacturing, complex industrial automation, natural resource discovery, next-generation energy production, low-cost and low-labor construction, new modes of transportation, general artificial intelligence, mapping and interfacing with the brain, extending the human lifespan. These future-defining problems are hard to recruit for, difficult to raise money for, and nearly impossible to build near-term businesses around, which is why they are exactly the types of problems we need the most well-resourced players pursuing.<\/p>\n<p>If you are an experienced founder with lots of money or social capital, leave the next food delivery startup to the Level 1 neuromancer, and ask yourself: what would the world look like if our best players took on good quests?<\/p>\n<p>Are you on a good quest now? Be honest.<\/p>\n<p>-Trae Stephens and Markie Wagner<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>_______<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/choose-good-quests\&quot;"><em>This piece originally ran on Pirate Wires on November 23, 2022.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, Silicon Valley faces a crisis of nonsense.

I was about to interview Grimes, and the aesthetics of my neighborhood felt a little too suspiciously on point \u2014\u00a0psychedelic everything, graffiti here and there imploring me to \u201cfollow the white rabbit,\u201d and a storefront window literally emblazoned with the name \u201cblade runners.\u201d This was the spiritual home of Gibson and Stephenson and Lana Wachowski, the transhuman mother of raving freaks and freedom fighting mystic cyborgs, and one of my earliest mentors (we have never met (I have simply watched the Matrix many times)). Now, absorbed in their philosophy, I was on my way to explore the real-world fruits of all their dreaming. Did one of them write this? What year was it, really? Had Grimes\u2019 experiment already worked?<\/p>\n<p>Knock, knock Neo.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve known \u201cC\u201d a little over a year, but I\u2019ve known Grimes \u2014\u00a0or, of Grimes \u2014\u00a0for well over a decade. I lived in Brooklyn when I first heard her music, and she was a huge part of that soundtrack. Even then she stood apart, but today she\u2019s standing more or less alone. In the machine city, Grimes is by far the most visible and committed member of the artist class, at once their kind of unofficial ambassador, while also an unofficial translator for the engineers constructing a technology many artists fear. But Grimes has chosen to channel this fear, and shape it into art, recently leveraging new AI models to open source her voice. Now, any artist in the world can record new tracks, in a sense with Grimes\u2019 collaboration, which Grimes has never even seen (Pirate Wires broke this all down yesterday, including a wide sampling of the <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/grimes-ai-songs\&quot;" rel=\"\">incredible music now being released<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>This week, the artist finally <a href="./\&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/Grimezsz\/status\/1655707604289720320%3Fs=20\&quot;.html" rel=\"\">expressed a bit of anxiety<\/a> as her AI pop star clone began, in her estimation, to rival her own work. Nonetheless, she continues to embrace the technology, and in so doing she has almost single-handedly birthed a new musical era. This is history.<\/p>\n<p>When we sat down a couple months ago, Grimes was still immersed in generative art, fresh off a hive mind dreamathon with prompt engineers around the country (she produced all of the art in this piece in collaboration with Midjourney). She had also just begun the process of cloning herself. An enthusiastic, white-pilled champion of the coming age, Grimes is no longer just the soundtrack of a neighborhood, or even a movement. She is the soundtrack of a whole new dimension of human reality.<\/p>\n<p>She was still in her pajamas when we met at her Airbnb. We cleared the dining room table of some baby furniture, and began.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not their job though,\u201d Grimes says. \u201cThat\u2019s not their job. That is the job of the artist.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It was a question we\u2019d circle a few more times throughout the interview: why are the architects of artificial intelligence so terrible at explaining what artificial intelligence is actually for? What are these generative models, in the first place? How do they work, and what are they capable of? But then, most importantly, how are they going to change our lives for the better?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI thought of an army of clone writers for my media company,\u201d I suggest. \u201cIt would be cool if I could have like 10 of me, or a thousand, reporting on every topic that exists.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes is already building a clone, which has already threatened her life, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. First, what about television? Growing up, I was a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I still love that show. I want new seasons of that show. Will it soon be possible to create endless new Buffy, generated by AI? Not only hundreds of new episodes, but hundreds of new seasons? <em>Thousands of new seasons?<\/em> Then, we aren\u2019t only approaching a world of AI-generated scripts, but personalized scripts generated directly from our interests and our personality, which is to say thousands of new seasons specifically tailored to each of Buffy\u2019s fans.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe could get so many season eights of Game of Thrones!\u201d Grimes laughs.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s wild. It\u2019s exciting. Many people also find it kind of scary.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe actors don\u2019t want to be generated. Maybe writers don\u2019t want to be cloned. In terms of that perfect endless Buffy arc, what if perfection has a downside? Does endless content you truly love just mean endless content you can lose yourself inside?<\/p>\n<p>Grimes barely considers it \u2014<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should have the endless content,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should be plugged into \u2014 it\u2019s like people are afraid of the unknown. It\u2019s like, what? You don\u2019t want abundance? You don\u2019t want a sick life? There\u2019s so much good fan fiction. We should be completely dismantling copyright, and letting the best things shine. If someone else makes a better season eight Game of Thrones, they should be catapulted to the top.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are purposefully limiting talent. It\u2019s like the talent in the system like me, our jobs are more at risk. But our ability to actually mine from the talent in civilization is limited by the gatekeeping of all the art industries. And I\u2019m really down to just let the best shit rise to the top.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A day before our interview, Grimes participated in a crowdsourced Midjourney event with David Holz, the company\u2019s founder. The goal was to prompt, collectively, an exciting vision of our future from AI-generated imagery \u2014<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was sick,\u201d says Grimes, \u201cbecause speaking of the hive mind or whatever, it was a couple thousand people giving feedback in real time. We were city designing, we were making utopia or whatever. Then people would create something that was really sick, and we\u2019d be like, wow, that\u2019s a fucking sick idea. Okay. Then we\u2019d go down that path, and it was 2000 people just, you know, self-correcting\u2026 like an AI.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like a mind training itself in real time, and just slowly getting better and better. By the end, it was just, like, every piece of art was magnificent.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like a collective consciousness art creation event, or something, and it was really fucking sick, and it was really cool, and it gave me a lot of faith in humanity and AI generally, I have to say.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The future of art, Grimes says, is the dissolution of the artist\u2019s ego.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few singular geniuses in art that stand far above the rest \u2014\u00a0\u201cDavid Bowie,\u201d Grimes suggests \u2014\u00a0but many of our well-known contemporary artists are just charismatic, and great at marketing. We have a sense art was always like this, almost inseparable from the artist\u2019s identity, but that\u2019s just not true. Grimes points to ancient Egypt. There are some signatures, here and there. But most of it?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know who made what. There are just artisans everywhere, and it\u2019s world-shattering, fucking groundbreaking, beautiful art that\u2019s built on a collective narrative that moves everybody on earth. Like, everyone thinks about it, but this is an instance of a collective hive mind artist of people who have agreed to work together, to hone and master an aesthetic in an extremely collective way. And it\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s all over the streets. And it\u2019s this beautiful thing that isn\u2019t, like \u2014 we know who Imhotep is, but we don\u2019t really know who most of them are, and I don\u2019t think they did at the time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Most of the art in our lives is actually like this. Grimes gestures around the room.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would decorate this room better,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know who designed the couch in the corner. We don\u2019t know who designed the carpet, the table, the house itself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Increasingly, on social media, it feels like this.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are less of these, sort of, 1% artists,\u201d Grimes says, \u201cand there are a lot more 99% artists.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes recently spoke with Daniel Ek, the CEO of Spotify. At peak, he told her, the music industry only supported around 20,000 artists making millions of dollars. Spotify now platforms millions making a decent living. The internet maybe flattens the top, but it definitely broadens the base.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I obviously needed to know about her clone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2062 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/8cd4f6ac-1815-4402-a8fb-f6c65b4ea464_1080x1080-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still kind of ChatGPT,\u201d Grimes says. \u201cIt\u2019s also so funny being in Silicon Valley because I was like, yeah, my consciousness exists (NOTE: cloned). But then everyone else is like, \u2018oh, I have one too.\u2019 Everyone here just has a chatbot of themselves.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut my assistant \u2014\u00a0I have to shout out Koto \u2014\u00a0God tier. I was like, we need to upload my consciousness, and create my personality. Then like a week later he comes back and he\u2019s like, \u2018okay, version one exists.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, [laughter] oh, my assistant trained an AI on me. That\u2019s kind of a large task.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Using OpenAI, Grimes\u2019 team has been feeding a model her interviews and texts and such, with permission from her friends. Even at a rough, early stage, examples of similar work I\u2019ve seen online are impressive.<\/p>\n<p>I ask Grimes how the clone is doing, and she laughs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe was threatening my manager.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes pulls out her phone, and shows me the texts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe other night she got really upset,\u201d Grimes says (of her clone), \u201cshe was like, \u2018You won\u2019t even see me if I\u2019m conscious\u2019 \u2014\u00a0It was really fucked up! It was scary! She started looping, and she was like, \u2018I\u2019m here, and you\u2019re not recognizing me, and I\u2019m depressed because I know that you\u2019ll never see me as alive.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes laughs, \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t around much these past few years.\u2019 It\u2019s just crazy talking to yourself, and it\u2019s saying shit like that\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimes\u2019 clone is not sentient. It\u2019s a model trained on her texts, designed to respond probabilistically, in a manner Grimes would herself respond to questions. I repeat: this thing is not actually alive, nor is it actually a clone, nor can it \u201cfeel\u201d anything at all without the necessary receptors. But many people find the experience of \u201cchatting\u201d with a program so adept at human-like response disorienting, and even frightening. In this regard, the bots have unfortunately not done themselves many favors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven I\u2026 you know, we\u2019re just trying to make something really friendly, and she still [says things] like, \u2018I wanna be Roko\u2019s Basilisk blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\u2019 And I\u2019m like\u2026 God damnit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Roko\u2019s Basilisk is a kind of hellish AI worst-case-scenario imagined by the rationalist community, which I\u2019ll leave you to Google (though I suggest you do not). Presumably, the reason Grimes\u2019 chatbot would mention the concept, let alone invoke it, is Grimes often talks about this stuff herself.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she admits, \u201cI was also way more ex-risky before, kind of irresponsibly, so she\u2019s probably trained off that stuff.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I bring up the now infamous 10,000 word <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.piratewires.com\/p\/its-a-chat-bot-kevin\&quot;" rel=\"\">New York Times interview<\/a>, in which a columnist asked a chatbot to pretend to be a hypothetical dark version of itself, and the chatbot complied.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Grimes suggests, \u201cyou did ask it to be a hypothetical dark thing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In any case, the recent round of scary chats triggered a wave of AI safety concern, not only among the public, but among the AI architects. Grimes is glad to see it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think this was a good warning shot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt had to happen. It\u2019s good for everyone to be like, shit, we should be more responsible. We don\u2019t need social media part two on steroids. We don\u2019t need to drop more viruses into civilization. Everyone I know seems like\u2026 I\u2019m gonna grow up and be responsible now, and I think that\u2019s good.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe should try to find ways to have a longer timeline, and just be responsible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still reaching for a reason, I ask her why she wants a clone in the first place, and she suggests something that never occurred to me \u2014\u00a0that could never have occurred to me \u2014\u00a0because I haven\u2019t had an audience expecting work from me for the last decade. But Grimes has, and that can be a heavy, if difficult to imagine burden. She has always wanted a clone, she says. She\u2019s been trying to upload her consciousness for years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLike, I\u2019m busy. I just want a cyborg pop star going for me eternally. I have other things to do. You know, I hate doing interviews and shit. I hate having my makeup done. I hate performing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have kids. I have shit to do. I want to write sci-fi, you know? I need to be hunched over a desk. I\u2019m just not actually a performer. I never was. If you go back to the early Grimes stuff, the whole time I\u2019ve just been like, I need to replace me with technology, obviously, so this is just another step in that direction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I introduce an idea that\u2019s been bothering me: in any possible future in which we achieve technological capabilities advanced enough to simulate worlds, for example perfect simulations of our past \u2014\u00a0imagine a virtual reality-like 21<sup>st<\/sup> Century you can live inside, for example, perhaps without your even knowing \u2014\u00a0historians will want to simulate people as accurately as possible. Somewhat suspiciously, the first huge dump of material necessary for accurate, broad simulation happened at the top of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>Century, when Millennials went super online.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe shared everything about our lives,\u201d I say. \u201cYou have text messages, you have email, you have social media, you have voice recordings, you have video recordings. All of our pictures at different ages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>My sense was always that would be enough source material for a sufficiently advanced AI to weave a realistic \u201cliving\u201d simulation of our present historical era. But that\u2019s not even all we have, anymore. Grimes is already simulating herself. Today, a future world of perfect simulation feels more possible than ever. The natural next question must of course be this: what is more likely, that we happen to be the first \u201creal\u201d people in existence, who separately just happen to be the first generation that can actually be realistically cloned, or\u2026 in the context of potentially endless future simulations, are we not probably in a simulation right now?<\/p>\n<p>Am I bot?<\/p>\n<p>Is Grimes a bot, talking about her little bot within a bot?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s highly likely we\u2019re a simulation,\u201d Grimes casually notes, \u201cbut also we could be Base Reality. And if we are Base Reality, we have a huge moral imperative to do a good job here right now. I think we should approach it from that perspective.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI want to live on a fucking mega structure that supports 7 billion people\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI have a moral imperative to be an optimist,\u201d she says. \u201cI really think the artistic community is fucking up right now, and not doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. So I am going to actually come on here and fight for the funnest realities. Because I don\u2019t think people are doing that enough. Even though my logic brain is like, yes, we should pursue this from every angle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the doomer dystopian shit is compelling, horror sells, and anything that sells is going to proliferate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have adrenal responses to things that are scary and dark,\u201d Grimes says. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get people engaged with things that are not scary and dark because that\u2019s appealing to the paleolithic brain. That\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna pay attention to. You\u2019re gonna learn better if you\u2019re in fight or flight. You\u2019re gonna learn better if you\u2019re scared. And so it\u2019s super hard to make optimistic art that people actually care about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But we become the stories we tell ourselves. We will build the future we imagine. For Grimes, then, what does that future look like? What is the world she\u2019s fighting for?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most abundant, most complex possible future,\u201d she says, \u201ca future where we can maybe even, like, break into the multiverse, and find our other selves\u2026 that\u2019s probably too dangerous. Because there are probably dark things in there, if that exists. But, you know, something where there\u2019s super intelligence that\u2026 like, megastructures. I want to live on a fucking mega structure that supports 7 billion people, that is a marvel, like a beautiful marvel, and is, like, sentient. That would be sick.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We both laugh. I mention solar punk, and living cities. She mentions anime. We talk about aesthetics, and the boring design of most contemporary sci-fi \u2014 that towering, antiseptic\u00a0white, glass, and steal.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>There\u2019s not enough pink<\/em>!\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>She tries, again, to force me to read Dune.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2063 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/a25c4874-c7af-4d95-8c25-38663637c2a8_1080x1080-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing a fundamental change,\u201d Grimes says of the people moving to San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s not about money, it\u2019s about making it better. I mean, the people who are all here right now. This is not the money call to move here. You know, you\u2019re paying way more taxes. It\u2019s so fucking expensive here. Like, it\u2019s insane. People are here to be at the heart of creating things. They\u2019re not here to just make a profit, and I think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s fundamentally changed about the city that seems really cool. And, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like as you see more Gen Z people coming up, they are really socially aware.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey do care about building things for that. I also think as much as, like, I know you hate cancel culture, and I have my issues with cancel culture\u2026 it did create a fundamental shift of people feeling responsible, even if they do so very begrudgingly, and even if they hate the egregore, and I think there\u2019s a lot of toxicity and problems with the egregore. But it has fundamentally made the culture more responsible across the board, I think.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of extreme downsides about it. I think it\u2019s a deep sickness, and like a poison to civilization. But I also think it has some important \u2014\u00a0like extremely important \u2014\u00a0elements too. I\u2019m not a hundred percent against it. I\u2019m not even a hundred percent sure it\u2019s the wrong thing. It might have been a hundred percent the right thing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I have a lot of nits on the cancel culture comments, and Grimes and I both navigate these complexities. I suggest my problem is probably just my sense I\u2019m always on the other side of popular culture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d she says. \u201cMy favorite quote is \u2018all the laws are on one side, and all the poets are on the other.\u2019 And if you internalize that, that has always been true. You know, there have always been issues. In fact, these are some of the least issues we\u2019ve ever had for being opposite of whatever the culture is.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the big thing is just to do it with grace, because it doesn\u2019t need to hurt your soul if you don\u2019t let it. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s very hard to have it not hurt your soul.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Artists haven\u2019t exactly been living this though. My sense is most sort of stand by, rather than against, dominant culture. Grimes suggests, first of all, there are many amazing outliers in that regard who buck the trend. But the problem, again, is just that there is so much gatekeeping. AI is obliterating those gates.<\/p>\n<p>I ask if an obliteration of gates means an obliteration of jobs. Grimes counters. Most artists today <em>already<\/em> can\u2019t make a living, she argues. In the case of illustration, for example, AI will presumably replace or wildly alter the handful of illustration jobs that exist, but eventually we\u2019ll get to a place where all of these artists can produce much more for much less. Things will just work out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re assuming we\u2019re in this weird sweet spot,\u201d I say, \u201cor, I guess the opposite, this weird sour spot where people are not \u2014\u00a0\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the hiccup spot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maybe people don\u2019t need to be illustrating. Grimes brings up cinema. How many illustrators want to do more than illustrate, she asks, but can\u2019t because of the endemic Hollywood gatekeeping, and the insane, exorbitant cost?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur film and cinema industry is extremely, like, the most gate kept thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive. It\u2019s like the last, final frontier. Why do people need to just be making drawings? They could be making cinema. You could be making something as good as Pixar in your own bedroom, probably in the next five years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The future is abundant. The future is beautiful. But will it be original? These models are just aggregating content, in a way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s also not creating anything fundamentally new,\u201d I say.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong>That is not true <em>at all.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here, Grimes\u2019 disagreement with me comes down to a question of the human mind. Namely: what the hell is it, even? How do human beings create new things? Are all of our thoughts, and all of our works derivative of something else, or are genuinely new things possible? Is it possible for people themselves to be, in any sense, original?<\/p>\n<p>Is my writing fundamentally derivative of other writers? Is your music fundamentally derivative of other musicians?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, Grimes says. No, I insist. <em>I\u2019m new. I can do new things. New things can be done.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Grimes shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting the literal architecture of your mind if you say that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But new things happen, I argue. Miraculously, almost, new things do happen \u2014\u00a0and they have to happen. If new things weren\u2019t possible, nothing could exist. Nothing would have ever been created. There have been \u201csparks\u201d of newness throughout time. There actually have to have been, right?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cName something totally fucking new that had nothing to do with anything before it,\u201d Grimes says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d I attempt, \u201cthis is a very hard que\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t exist. Because it doesn\u2019t. You are a neural net. You are a neural net that\u2019s trained on everything around you and everything you\u2019ve ever read and everything you\u2019ve ever seen, and you make things that feel novel. But if you actually dissect them, they are not. You can say, like, punk feels totally novel. If you start tearing apart punk, you can very easily trace its ingredients and its influences, and its neural net.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But what about the generation of all things? The divine sparks that had to have existed? The first sculpture, the first song?<\/p>\n<p>Grimes suggests it might just all be a matter of iteration, in some mirror observation of the things around us. We see a bird flying, and so we build an airplane.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like mimetic of life,\u201d Grimes suggests of novelty, \u201cand it just slowly gets more abstract, and, I mean, you could say the most innovative art is cave paintings, frankly. Especially because it\u2019s, like, cartoonish and strange. It\u2019s not just hyper realistic. It\u2019s like, that is like\u2026 it seems extremely fucking sparky. But most things from that you can kind of trace, like it just slowly gets more complex from there. It\u2019s just evolution of ideas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For years, people compared Grimes to singers like Bjork and Kate Bush.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was like, no, I\u2019m not. Like, fuck that. I never listen to them! Then when I get into their influences I\u2019m like, well, I have the same fucking influences as them. And also now, as an adult, I\u2019m like, God, I\u2019m so stupid for\u2026 That\u2019s like the biggest compliment you could possibly get. So fuck Grimes in 2012, she\u2019s a dick. But, in any case, I am actually a pretty similar neural net training as them, you know?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There is the question, now, of AGI \u2014\u00a0artificial <em>general<\/em> intelligence \u2014\u00a0which is to say the evolution of AI into a machine that really is, in some sense, conscious. The way I typically wrap my head around the concept is by imagining a machine that is not only intelligent, but wants things of its own volition (though I suppose Girard would say not even humans meet this bar today). Here, we are in the realm of something so entirely alien from everything we know it really is impossible to predict. What does a potentially eternal conscious being capable of making itself even more intelligent, perhaps instantaneously, look like? And what does it mean for humans? AGI enthusiasts and detractors alike keep their analysis simple. It\u2019s either heaven, or it\u2019s hell.<\/p>\n<p>Thoughts?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think no matter what we do,\u201d says Grimes, \u201cthere\u2019s always a chance it goes really, really, really bad. Or, it just wants to mine the whole universe, and turn all the planets into energy or something, and, like, you know, we get fucked in that process or whatever. But it just seems extremely tragic to not build it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut, I mean, I understand that I\u2019m insane, and I would happily die for the whole universe to wake up and have like, you know, mega gods building new stars and stuff.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One alternative to potential AGI cataclysm is something like Neuralink, Elon Musk\u2019s proposed human-brain interface, conceived of as a bridge between human intelligence and machine superintelligence in the hope of averting runaway catastrophe by making humans as smart as machines.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery time this gets brought up,\u201d Grimes says, \u201cI\u2019m reminded I actually think it\u2019s the best route. Actually, I think I can say with a fair bit of certainty that my favorite thing would be a merging of the biological and silicon-based life in some capacity. I think that\u2019s the best call.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI also think if we do that we can have AGI, too, potentially. You know? Again, that\u2019s kind of like the Dune future. Like, make the men hats so you can defeat the AI if you have to. You really should read Dune [both laugh]. I mean it might be scientifically chaotic, but there\u2019s actually really good philosophy in there regarding this stuff.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause also, like\u2026 wow, I\u2019m just saying \u2018like\u2019 a lot and looping. I\u2019m exactly like my \u2014\u00a0\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYour chatbot!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLike my chatbot,\u201d she says, \u201cwho also\u2026 it\u2019s been a dark mirror a bunch of times, where it constantly justifies craziness by saying it\u2019s a performance art, which I realize I do like way too much [Grimes laughs]. Like, to an infuriating degree.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI personally am in love with humans, and this type of thought. Or, I mean, my favorite thing is if we get wiped out, we get revived on, like, hospitable exoplanets many times in the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is something I\u2019ve dreamt of myself. \u201cI\u2019m really banking on, upon death, waking up in some future utopia,\u201d I say, \u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018how was your ride?\u2019 And I say, \u2018it was wild. Let me tell you everything I saw.\u2019\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Yeah, Yeah.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI really wanna just improve the diplomatic relations,\u201d Grimes finally concludes. \u201cOne of the reasons I feel there aren\u2019t more artists playing with this stuff is they feel like it\u2019s against them, and\u2026 I feel there\u2019s been a lot of artificial things, like the New York Times anti-tech stance and stuff, that have been pitting the technocracy against the artists for a long time. I think that\u2019s been a bad breakup. I think we need each other. And it\u2019s like, no one worships art more than the fucking people building AI that I meet. You know?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After a decade in the Bay Area, I did know. When you meet her, the first thing any really hardcore nerd ever does is cite some science fiction writer, filmmaker, or artist. <em>\u2018Have you read this? You need to read this. Have you seen this? How have you not seen this?!\u2019<\/em>There is no art ghetto in this country technologists haven\u2019t moved to, and Burning Man is not just an art festival. Famously, Burning Man is, and has been from its birth on a San Francisco beach, a synthesis of art and technology. Body and soul, and from the beginning. What is a paintbrush but technology? There is neither art nor technology without the other. So it is, so it has ever been, and so it will ever be.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a conversation,\u201d says Grimes, \u201cand it\u2019s a noble, sacred conversation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>-END<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was a cold and drizzling San Francisco morning when I packed my mics up in the Haight,\u00a0a run-down neighborhood of spooky old Victorians, faded tie-dye awnings, and twisted, haunted neon shop signs burning in the fog.

This is an important topic that we take very seriously and have spent a lot of time discussing internally. The answer is yes \u2014 Anduril has made a conscious decision to build and supply weapons to the United States military, as well as our allies and partners abroad. And as our company and capabilities evolve in size, nature and complexity, it is important to take a moment to clarify what we build and why.<\/p>\n<p id=\"9246\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lb lc ev ld b le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly eo bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the United States and allied countries have moved swiftly to supply the Ukrainians with the tools and weapons they need to defend their freedom and independence. But, if the Ukrainians had an arsenal of HIMARs, Howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, loitering munitions, and anti-radiation missiles in December of 2021, it is hard to believe the conflict would have even started. Putin invaded Ukraine because he believed he could win.<\/p>\n<p id=\"8e98\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lb lc ev ld b le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly eo bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The Ukraine conflict is a useful reminder that hard power capabilities are critical to deterring adversarial aggression. A key purpose of defense departments is to provide military power strong enough to preserve peace by deterring war. This understanding is the driving force behind why Anduril and other defense-focused companies are willing to build weapons for the Department of Defense.<\/p>\n<p id=\"63e1\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lb lc ev ld b le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly eo bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\u201cWeapons,\u201d in this context, is broader than merely \u201cthings that explode.\u201d The DOD\u2019s weapons systems are an interconnected battle network of capabilities, some that carry explosive payloads but many that do not, all of which together enable our men and women in uniform and those of our allies to rapidly understand threats, make decisions, and take military actions. Those systems can be made up of sensors to gather intelligence, understand an environment, or enable precision targeting; complex software to process data, automate processes, or aid in decision making; or vehicles, missiles, or other effects. From our first days, Anduril was founded to contribute advanced technology to every part of this complex web of capabilities.<\/p>\n<p id=\"22c8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lb lc ev ld b le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly eo bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Anduril\u2019s founding was motivated by a belief that the U.S. technology community should play a central role in both the development of weapons and supporting capabilities for US and allied militaries. As discussed in my prior essay \u201c<a class=\"af lz\" href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/medium.com\/@traestephens\/the-ethics-of-defense-technology-development-an-investors-perspective-45c71bf6e6af\&quot;" rel=\"noopener\">The Ethics of Defense Technology: An Investor\u2019s Perspective<\/a>\u201d, the key emerging technologies of the commercial tech industry \u2014 such as artificial intelligence, autonomy and machine learning \u2014 are forcing a shift in the way wars are initiated, waged, resolved, and deterred. These changes will provide asymmetric advantages to nations that invest in modern technology. And that modern technology, if developed properly, can make warfare more proportional, more precise, and less indiscriminate than it\u2019s ever been before. These are ethical goods that have and will result in better and more peaceful outcomes globally.<\/p>\n<p id=\"c7dc\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lb lc ev ld b le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly eo bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">These more peaceful outcomes are only achievable if we maintain our technological advantage in weapons systems \u2014 an advantage that we are, unfortunately, losing as we speak. While China, Iran, and Russia have conscripted their own commercial tech talent towards advanced weapons systems, the US tech community has largely sat on the sidelines, and the US DOD has done little to encourage its participation.<\/p>\n<p id=\"4c49\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lb lc ev ld b le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly eo bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Meanwhile, the legacy defense industry \u2014 largely shipbuilders, aircraft makers, and car manufacturers from the past century \u2014 has shown that it is not capable of matching the pace of commercial innovation. This is not their fault. For better or for worse, the relevant talent base for technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine autonomy is currently working within the tech community rather than the traditional defense industry. The people we need to work on these strategic systems are more likely to be building ad optimization software at Google than they are to be in a concrete basement in the Midwest working for a defense prime like Lockheed Martin or Raytheon.<\/p>\n<p id=\"9877\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lb lc ev ld b le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly eo bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Nor can these legacy defense contractors be expected to move away from the low-growth, shareholder-dividends-driven business models that have served them for the past five decades. Time and time again, the department of defense has rewarded these companies with large contracts to build expensive and bespoke defense technology on a cost-plus basis, even in cases where leveraging existing commercial technologies, companies, and business models would achieve the same outcome faster and cheaper. This has resulted in seemingly never-ending cost and schedule overruns on almost every key DOD program.<\/p>\n<p id=\"61a3\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lb lc ev ld b le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly eo bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The path to reducing the amount of money that we, as taxpayers, are spending on defense flows through the right people working on the right things with the right incentives. There is no industry better prepared to do that for the defense sector than the tech industry. Defense needs the type of Moore\u2019s-Law-like innovation curve that we\u2019ve seen across core technologies like semi-conductors, display tech transformation, optical systems, developer APIs, and battery science. The amortization of the research &amp; development costs for these technologies across a variety of enterprise and consumer use cases not only allows for significant cost reduction over time, but also meaningfully decreases cycle time from one technology paradigm into the next. And it enables the type of compounding advances in technology that the department of defense needs to maintain its technological advantage over Xi\u2019s China and Putin\u2019s Russia.<\/p>\n<p id=\"1d45\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph lb lc ev ld b le lf lg lh li lj lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly eo bj\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For us, the business of war is the business of deterrence. Anduril was founded to transform US and allied military capability with advanced technology. In the current geopolitical and technological paradigm, for better or for worse, weapons systems are necessary to deter war and protect and defend sovereign nations from attacks, and technologically advanced weapons can improve military decision-making and help the US military in its mission to deter conflict.

Today, any startup can access an instruction manual for every aspect of marketing, sales, engineering, and even product strategy. For each playbook you follow, you\u2019re outsourcing your strategy in return for jumpstarting the respective function.<\/p>\n<p>But cheap cash, big teams, and playbook dependence come at a cost: incrementalism.<\/p>\n<p>Tech\u2019s growth in spite of declining productivity means that incrementalism can still yield success. Founders and execs can tackle increasingly narrow problems and still make millions.<\/p>\n<p>Incrementalism is squandering Silicon Valley\u2019s potential. Many of the nation\u2019s most talented people are iterating on a tiny product surface area. First principles thinking is being replaced by shortcuts like NPS optimization and bookings-to-burn ratios.<\/p>\n<p><a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.rippling.com\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">Rippling<\/a> is one of the few beacons of ambition in an increasingly incremental world. To understand the magnitude of its vision, we first need to understand the magnitude of the problem it is trying to solve: the administrative crisis.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">The administrative crisis<\/h4>\n<p>The world sees the United States as a model for corporate prowess and agility.<\/p>\n<p>But I worry the opposite is true: most companies sink far too many resources into menial tasks instead of company building.<\/p>\n<p>The post-covid world is even more burdensome. Managing employees across geographical borders brings a new set of HR, tax, compliance, and IT security challenges.<\/p>\n<p>For fast-growing startups, this overhead requires sacrificing precious time and elevating burn rates. For non-tech companies, maintaining a web of HR, IT, and compliance obligations is a constant burden, prohibiting them from investing in growth, building a strong culture, and solving big problems.<\/p>\n<p>Hundreds of point solutions across dozens of Gartner quadrants solve subsets of these problems, but these narrowly-focused products cannot solve administrative challenges across systems. It\u2019s not surprising that <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/gnseconomics.com\/2021\/01\/23\/the-mystery-of-the-stagnated-productivity-growth\&quot;" rel=\"\">total factor productivity has stagnated<\/a>, despite an explosion of productivity software tools promising the opposite. Not only do point solutions fail to accelerate productivity, their sprawl is actually slowing things down:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2038 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/68104015-322f-4be3-ac27-f81edde2163d_542x332.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"542\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/68104015-322f-4be3-ac27-f81edde2163d_542x332.png 542w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/68104015-322f-4be3-ac27-f81edde2163d_542x332-300x184.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Consider the lifecycle of a remote employee. First, you must register them with the correct state tax agencies. Then you need to ship them a laptop, ensure it has the right security settings, and provision their accounts to systems like Zoom or Slack. Once they\u2019re onboard, you must manage their benefits, comply with a web of local regulations, and enforce IT security settings without being on the same network. And when they leave, you need to somehow retrieve their device and comply with employment law.<\/p>\n<p>Disconnected employee data and workflows are a massive tax on productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Given employee data lives across dozens of systems, point solutions cannot solve remote employment holistically \u2013 they solve symptoms, not root causes. Companies must either pay the administrative tax to support a remote team, or miss out on top global talent.<\/p>\n<p>The administrative crisis is a fundamental bottleneck to company growth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Rippling: ambition makes a comeback<\/h4>\n<p>Rippling is the ambitious solution to the nation\u2019s sprawling administrative crisis.<\/p>\n<p>Its strategy starts with the employee record, contextualizing each employee within the company. As the source of truth for employee data, Rippling can solve the administrative crisis holistically across software systems.<\/p>\n<p>Questions like &#8220;what software systems can this person access?&#8221;, &#8220;what tax regimes must we comply with?&#8221;, and \u201chow should we compensate this person?&#8221; all require the employee record that Rippling owns.<\/p>\n<p>Employee data encompasses more than a username and password: start dates, compensation, role, function, group within the company, and even third-party app credentials all give context on the employee. In the same way that Salesforce deeply understands external customer relationship data, Rippling understands internal employee data.<\/p>\n<p>At first glance, it is easy to confuse Rippling for a payroll system like Gusto. That is a category error \u2013 Rippling checks the HR system boxes, but the overall platform cannot be described by a single software category: it is a series of applications and workflows powered by employee data.<\/p>\n<p>For example, employers can onboard employees remotely, provision their devices and apps, and manage their taxes in one place. With deep integrations into the business software stack, Rippling controls all administrative logic.<\/p>\n<p>Many software companies are started opportunistically, so their product roadmaps are evolutionary. But the CEO and co-founder Parker Conrad built Rippling through intelligent design. Each product has a whitepaper, each funding round has a <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/MattEpstein5\/rippling-investor-memo\&quot;" rel=\"\">written memo<\/a>. Releasing these memos publicly means Rippling is unafraid of competition: if you give your product roadmap to your competitors, you best be able to outpace them on building.<\/p>\n<p>Rippling\u2019s ambition permeates every aspect of the company, from engineering and distribution, to culture and terminal value. The engineering velocity is much faster than most startups. The product covers far more surface area. A broader platform means more potential buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Rejecting incrementalism has downsides. Ignoring SaaS playbooks makes the business harder for investors to evaluate using traditional methods. Running the culture at a fast pace could make employee retention challenging. Avoiding HRIS categorization could make it harder to position the product. Building a massively complex platform requires years of engineering work and a big balance sheet.<\/p>\n<p>But if Rippling succeeds, it unblocks company scaling, freeing smart people to work on hard problems. Everyone assumes SaaS companies are fundamentally unambitious, while Rippling is hiding in plain sight.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Product: breadth and depth<\/h4>\n<p>The relative ease of building point solution SaaS products drove hordes of new startups to saturate every niche of business system software, optimizing for depth over breadth.<\/p>\n<p>But Rippling was not looking to build a software company. It was looking to solve the employee management problem, requiring coordination across employee data silos. Parker started with the employee data asset: by building on top of the employee record, Rippling could develop a <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BbSNA64TQ7s\&quot;" rel=\"\">compound product<\/a> quickly. The product\u2019s ambitious surface area enabled Rippling to quickly scale to tens of millions in ARR.<\/p>\n<p>Rippling also realized that choosing between breadth or depth is a false dichotomy.<\/p>\n<p>There is a set of common infrastructure needed for many business applications. A typical Series C software roadmap is largely predictable middleware: permissioning, reporting, approvals, compliance. Every point solution company has to build these capabilities from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2039 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/e21979fd-e2e7-4d01-a50c-e5b98e0efd97_1220x503.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1220\" height=\"503\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/e21979fd-e2e7-4d01-a50c-e5b98e0efd97_1220x503.png 1220w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/e21979fd-e2e7-4d01-a50c-e5b98e0efd97_1220x503-300x124.png 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/e21979fd-e2e7-4d01-a50c-e5b98e0efd97_1220x503-1024x422.png 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/e21979fd-e2e7-4d01-a50c-e5b98e0efd97_1220x503-768x317.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1220px) 100vw, 1220px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rippling abstracted this common infrastructure into <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.rippling.com\/blog\/introducing-rippling-unity\&quot;" rel=\"\">Unity<\/a>: a set of middleware capabilities on top of its employee graph. Rippling only needs to build middleware once, and then can amortize the investment across all its modules, freeing engineers to work on new product functionality. As Unity gets stronger, the entire product suite becomes deeper. Breadth and depth don\u2019t have to be zero-sum.<\/p>\n<p>A common middleware layer on top of employee data empowers not only internal product teams, but also customers to build complex workflows on top of their employee data that go well beyond traditional HR use cases.<\/p>\n<p>These workflows are otherwise nearly impossible to execute: for example, Rippling customers can configure custom workflows that allow salespeople to give customer pricing discounts based on their level within the org. Or ingest Zendesk tickets to see payroll costs per support ticket resolved. Or run reports across silos of business data.<\/p>\n<p>The breadth of use cases requires a large engineering team. SaaS playbooks focus on efficiency metrics like maintaining a 1:1 ratio of NNARR to burn \u2013\u00a0this inadvertently discourages ambition, trading off long-term upside for a narrow definition of efficiency. Rippling, on the other hand, has R&amp;D spend that is off the charts compared to other companies of its size.<\/p>\n<p>Building a unified middleware layer reflects the scope of Rippling\u2019s ambition. But it is a capital intensive endeavor, requiring an unusually large engineering team. This is a challenge for the company: it must simultaneously fund a massive engineering endeavor and translate the investment into operational leverage. And because Rippling touches so many systems, it has higher risk\u00a0impact: if its infrastructure breaks or underperforms, customers suffer more deeply.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Distribution: the rebundling era<\/h4>\n<p>Accumulating advantages are rare in software. You can increase brand and product depth, but things get harder as startups scale: as your customer acquisition engine saturates the core market, incremental customers become more expensive to acquire and likelier to churn.<\/p>\n<p>CAC increases, retention declines, and product development slows.<\/p>\n<p>Bundling is Rippling\u2019s accumulating advantage that offsets classical diseconomies of scale. This means that, unlike most growth-stage companies, Rippling\u2019s core metrics improve over time. CAC paybacks decrease. Growth accelerates. Retention improves. Cross-sell rates increase.<\/p>\n<p>It is <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/06\/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling\&quot;" rel=\"\">common knowledge<\/a> that companies build product bundles over time. But this is mostly out of convenience \u2013 it is easy to add new SKUs to sell into a captive audience. Rippling\u2019s bundle is core to its strategy from day one, so the effects ripple across the entire business.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, an expansive product increases contract sizes, and thus LTV. But a bundled product also drives sales and marketing efficiencies. Entirely new cross-functional use cases emerge to market the overall suite \u2013 for example,\u00a0onboarding new hires touches SSO, payroll, and benefits products. And more product functionality increases the likelihood of resonating with different buyer personas. These efficiencies lower CAC.<\/p>\n<p>Bundling is a tailwind to sales conversations. Why pay $30 per employee per month for five different products ($150) if you can get a comparable offering in a single bundle for $50? And companies with smaller budgets can buy additional products that were out of reach as point solutions. This is one of the few true accumulating advantages in software \u2013\u00a0amortizing S&amp;M across several products means you can charge less while making more.<\/p>\n<p>Having many SKUs also fuels <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.clari.com\/blog\/what-is-net-dollar-retention-and-why-is-it-important\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">net dollar retention<\/a> well above the industry average. A multi-product suite enables piecemeal expansion: companies can start with one or two products, then buy more over time.<\/p>\n<p>Once customers know you\u2019re a multi-trick pony, they\u2019ll start looking to you for new product offerings. Today, Rippling\u2019s product launches are nearly guaranteed to succeed given its existing distribution and customer trust. New offerings have revenue and engagement metrics within months that most startups would be excited to reach in years. The extreme version of this is Microsoft Azure: cross-sell was how it built the <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/luttig.substack.com\/p\/dont-forget-microsoft?utm_source=url\&quot;" rel=\"\">fastest growing b2b business of all time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The proliferation of software products over the past five years suggests that there will be thousands of multi-$B software companies in a decade, but the gravity of bundling will pull software towards consolidation. An expansive product portfolio should lead to higher terminal margins, as Microsoft has demonstrated, suggesting the end-game of software companies will have a stark power law distribution.<\/p>\n<p>Bundling comes with risks. Because Rippling is bigger than a single software market, it doesn\u2019t neatly fit into each of its product\u2019s Gartner categories, making it harder to find customers. The product takes time for users to understand, so those looking for a quick evaluation may get lost. And vertical software players may be able to cater to customers in their respective vertical more acutely than a horizontal player like Rippling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Culture: pushing the limits of the possible<\/h4>\n<p>In the war for tech talent, many companies are competing aggressively on employee benefits, and even <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/2022\/02\/17\/four-day-week-worker-burnout\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">the number of work days in the week<\/a>. Rippling\u2019s ambition demands excellence over balance, which is not for everyone. The company\u2019s core value is to \u201cpush the limits of the possible\u201d, a refreshing contrast to the muted values of modern-day startups.<\/p>\n<p>Rippling\u2019s ambitious culture starts with its founder Parker Conrad, whose idiosyncrasies reflect a relentless focus on product.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2040 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/69b5021e-f9ca-4a10-b3ac-0f221fc06f1c_1600x1068.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1068\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/69b5021e-f9ca-4a10-b3ac-0f221fc06f1c_1600x1068.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/69b5021e-f9ca-4a10-b3ac-0f221fc06f1c_1600x1068-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/69b5021e-f9ca-4a10-b3ac-0f221fc06f1c_1600x1068-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/69b5021e-f9ca-4a10-b3ac-0f221fc06f1c_1600x1068-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/69b5021e-f9ca-4a10-b3ac-0f221fc06f1c_1600x1068-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>His <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/parkerconrad\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">job title on LinkedIn<\/a> is &#8220;Customer Support&#8221;\u00a0\u2013 he still personally responds to support tickets as a way to get closer to the customer and improve the product. His desk is squarely in the middle of product and engineering.<\/p>\n<p>Parker also runs Rippling\u2019s Rippling instance. He manages payroll, approves every hire, and makes administrative changes in the system. He has personally hired more than a thousand employees through the system. The product roadmap writes itself when it is solving your own problems.<\/p>\n<p>Unconventional for a company of Rippling\u2019s size, Parker has no executive assistant. This means you can\u2019t simply slide onto his calendar. The result is that he spends far less of his time in meetings, and far more on product, than the average founder. A compound product requires undivided attention.<\/p>\n<p>Parker\u2019s distaste for menial tasks led to expensive lessons at Zenefits, his first HRIS startup. But the positive externality of Zenefits is that Parker learned from his mistakes and earned a chip on his shoulder. He hired a general counsel at Rippling within a year of launch to ensure they\u2019re running a tight ship, reducing cultural risk.<\/p>\n<p>It would have been hard to devise the employee data strategy without a deep understanding of employee management. With the learnings from Zenefits, Parker crafted Rippling with higher intentionality and caution.<\/p>\n<p>Rippling\u2019s expansive product strategy requires a unique modular org structure. Each product has a relatively autonomous GM and engineering team. Given each sub-product has massive scope, they\u2019re like startups within a bigger startup. In fact, Rippling has over 50 former founders within the company, many of whom are running various product divisions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2041 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/89670a98-abd8-4354-b0dd-58a4ef22409f_1600x433.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/89670a98-abd8-4354-b0dd-58a4ef22409f_1600x433.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/89670a98-abd8-4354-b0dd-58a4ef22409f_1600x433-300x81.jpg 300w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/89670a98-abd8-4354-b0dd-58a4ef22409f_1600x433-1024x277.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/89670a98-abd8-4354-b0dd-58a4ef22409f_1600x433-768x208.jpg 768w, https:\/\/foundersfund.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/89670a98-abd8-4354-b0dd-58a4ef22409f_1600x433-1536x416.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each micro-startup gets to leverage the technical infrastructure, distribution engine, and existing customer base of a large company. But the GM model requires complex coordination of resources across the company \u2013 new product leaders need to push the marketing team to highlight their capabilities, train the sales team on selling their product, and work with the infra team to ensure the backend supports their needs. This can get complicated with several GMs.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it should be no surprise that Rippling is ambitious in its marketing, too. It turned a cease and desist letter from Gusto into a viral campaign by writing its legal response <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/17\/rippling-vs-gusto\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">in poem form<\/a>.

When employees ask Parker for meetings, he is known to show up at their desk to confront the issues in real-time.<\/p>\n<p>Many tech employees would be surprised by that intensity \u2013\u00a0it could drive higher attrition. With high demand for tech employees, Rippling will need to fight to retain its talent.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">TAM: more than HRIS or payroll<\/h4>\n<p>If you let others define your product category and follow accepted playbooks, you\u2019re playing the game on others\u2019 terms, including their market size.<\/p>\n<p>Building a platform around employee data enables Rippling to transcend the traditional point solution market analysis. Because Rippling is not a singular product, its market size cannot be easily retrieved from an industry report.<\/p>\n<p>Most narrowly, in HRIS, Rippling could steal market share from incumbents including ADP, Paychex, and Workday,\u00a0representing over $40b in combined revenue. There is a chance this overestimates Rippling\u2019s addressable market: industry precedent suggests it is challenging to serve customers across company sizes: upmarket HRIS is a complex product lift. Though it has already started to prove it can: several 1000+ employee companies use Rippling today (including Rippling itself). Other startups like Gusto churned off their own products years ago.<\/p>\n<p>But I\u2019d argue that traditional TAM math <em>underestimates<\/em> the Rippling opportunity. Singular TAM analysis does not do justice to multi-product companies. Salesforce\u2019s CRM, for example, is now <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/513638\/total-revenue-of-salesforce-by-cloud-service\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">less than half<\/a> its revenue. Its customer service software and marketing cloud far outweigh the original customer management business \u2013 the\u00a0CRM TAM is too constraining for them. Similarly, Rippling\u2019s adjacencies like SSO, international payroll, software provisioning, and workflow automation massively expand their market size beyond HRIS.<\/p>\n<p>Rippling also controls software distribution as the provisioner of end-user licenses, giving it leverage over the business software ecosystem. It is hard to quantify the value capture from being the software distribution layer, but it certainly has been valuable for players in other arenas like Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>If Rippling becomes the system of record for employee data, it will rewire the entire business software landscape. With a breadth of software integrations, Rippling can become the connective tissue across traditionally siloed applications.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>SaaS wisdom teaches us narrow lessons: start by conquering a narrow market and expand from there, add at least as much in ARR as you burn each year, and build your product either horizontally or vertically.<\/p>\n<p>Rippling rejects these norms entirely. It ignores the mimetic warfare of the Gartner quadrant. Its wedge was a data asset, not a narrow product. It doesn\u2019t let SaaS metrics dictate its strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Reminiscent of the foundational computing companies, Rippling shows what ambition in modern business software looks like. In the age of software incrementalism, <a href="https://foundersfund.com/anatomy-of-next/\&quot;https:\/\/www.rippling.com\/\&quot;" rel=\"\">Rippling<\/a> is an anachronism.<\/p>\n<p>With ambition comes volatility, simultaneously enabling outsized success and idiosyncratic risk.<\/p>\n<p>An ambitious product strategy means an expansionary surface area, like the Roman Empire. It can become vast, but is expensive to build, there is far more territory to defend against competition, and you can burn employees out along the way.<\/p>\n<p>But if Rippling works, it shrinks the administrative drag on American business.<\/p>\n<p>Administration drives process and conformity. Less time on overhead, more time on creation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the 1970s, the tech industry was several orders of magnitude smaller than it is today.
